The ongoing influenza A/H1N1 pandemic may represent a tipping point in this trend, with A/H1N1 being the first human pathogen routinely genotyped from the beginning of its spread. To take full advantage of this genetic information, we introduce a novel method to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of outbreaks from sequence data. The approach is based on a new paradigm were ancestries are inferred directly rather than through the reconstruction of most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) as in phylogenetics.  Using 279 A/H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences, we confirm the emergence of the 2009 flu pandemic in Mexico. The virus initially spread to the US, and then to the rest of the world with both Mexico and the US acting as the main sources. While compatible with current epidemiological understanding of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, our results provide a much finer picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics. The results also highlight how much additional epidemiological information can be gathered from genetic monitoring of a disease outbreak.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><!--WRITE-PARA--><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p3">As the first pandemic of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 outbreak acts as a timely reminder of the looming threat posed by emerging infectious diseases. Indeed, the worldwide spread of a new deadly pathogen with sustained human-to-human transmission is one of the most worrying public health scenarios. Early containment based on robust scientific evidence is recognised as our best hope to avert a catastrophic situation if faced with the global spread of a deadly pathogen&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1528575305">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4003802975">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4284081810">[3]</xref>. To be most effective, prophylactic interventions must be implemented early on and will be based on only very preliminary scientific evidence. Thus, it is crucial that all sources of useful information be considered. Genetic sequence data can now be generated essentially in real time and the analysis of sequence data has already been added to the toolbox of epidemiology and pandemic planning&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3642897493">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3884883694">[5]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4293972016">[6]</xref>.

The analysis of sequence data collected during disease outbreaks poses considerable challenges. Phylogenetic reconstruction is hampered by the limited genetic diversity inherent to the early stages of an outbreak as obtaining statistical support behind MRCAs requires extensive genetic polymorphism. More fundamentally, the reconstruction of MRCAs becomes inappropriate when ancestors and their descendents are both present in the sample analyzed, as is bound to happen during the early stages of an outbreak. To circumvent these problems, we introduce a new methodological paradigm for the analysis of genetic data structured in space and time (Fig. 1). Rather than reconstructing hypothetical MRCAs, we developed an algorithm called <italic>SeqTrack</italic>, which directly reconstructs the most likely ancestries in space and time. </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p5">We applied the novel methodology to 297 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-443515402">[11]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1626420537">[12]</xref>.

First, each observed strain has one, and only one ancestor. Second, ancestors always precede their descendents in time.

The purpose of <italic>SeqTrack</italic> is to identify the most likely genealogy.

The advantage of this approach is that the average pairwise genetic differentiation between strains should not differ statistically between the sample and the population. </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p25">Another limiting factor for simulating outbreaks relates to the number of simulated generations.

These simulations were complemented by a second set of simulations run under structured dispersal, where strains had variable probabilities of seeding different locations. This allowed for a source and sink dynamics more representative of actual outbreaks. Analysis of the simulations indicated that the true ancestral haplotype (100% identity) was successfully retrieved in 77% of cases on average throughout all simulations (CI<sub>95%</sub>=[77%-78%]; Fig. 2).

In figure 2, we represent the reconstruction by our method of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic split into three major stages: (i) initial spread in Mexico and the US (Fig. 3a), (ii) sustained transmission within North America and spread to the rest of the world (Fig. 3b) and (iii) further worldwide spread and secondary outbreaks outside the Americas (Fig. 3c).</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p31"><fig id="fig-30"><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p32"><bold>Figure 3.

This pattern gives further support to the A/H1N1 having originated in Mexico. Secondary outbreaks within the US become widespread during the second phase while Mexico and the US also start seeding the rest of the world (Fig. 3b). It is also during this stage that we infer the first case of a within-country transmission outside the Americas (France on the 1<sup>st</sup> of May). Many of the ancestries over large geographic distances are well supported, suggesting that the intercontinental inferred ancestries accurately capture the actual pattern of transmission from the Americas to Europe, Asia, and Australia. Conversely, the fraction of transmissions with low associated statistical support may represent cases where intermediate stages in the ancestry path have not been sampled. This is also likely to be the case during the third phase, where many transmissions originating from Mexico, the US, and Canada are characterized by faint statistical support. Conversely, the increasing number of local transmissions in Asia, Russia and Australia are characterised by high statistical support and point to the emergence of multiple secondary outbreaks. </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p35">Flight traffic is widely recognized as an important determinant for the spread of seasonal and pandemic influenza at large geographic scales&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1528575305">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4003802975">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4284081810">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4107853524">[23]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3858082061">[24]</xref>. Thus, we evaluated the relationship between passenger-flow and the number of inferred transmissions between countries. Both quantities were fairly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.54; <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>t </italic>= 3.75; df = 34; P = 3.3 x 10<sup>-4</sup>), but this correlation was largely driven by the high connectivity of the US with Mexico and Canada. A far more remarkable aspect of the spatiotemporal reconstruction of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic is the near-absence of implausible transmission events (Fig. 3). The only possible exceptions to this pattern are two Mexican sequences which trace their ancestry back to the US. However, the statistical support was very low in both cases with likelihoods of 2.1x10-7 and 0.11. The inference of at least one implausible event from the US to Mexico was inescapable as the oldest sequences present in the dataset were all sampled in the US. The absence of implausible transmissions during the later stages of the pandemic is particularly surprising as we expected <italic>SeqTrack</italic> to struggle with the increasingly sparse sampling of the extant viral strains. Over the time period analyzed, the available samples become less representative of the global viral population; A/H1N1 cases have been increasing essentially exponentially but the sequencing effort has diminished from the end of April. </p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Discussion</title><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p36">We have introduced a new methodological paradigm for the analysis of genetic data sampled during an outbreak. We developed a method rooted in this paradigm which behaves satisfactorily on simulated data and reconstructs a highly plausible global scenario for the early stages of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. We reconstruct an initial outbreak in Mexico, and a rapid spread to the US. At a later stage, Mexico and the US act as the principal source for the worldwide diffusion of the virus, with secondary foci of infection becoming increasingly common with time outside the Americas. However, there is considerable potential for methodological developments and improvements of the <italic>SeqTraq </italic>algorithm, both in the short and the long term. </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p37">In this paper we used maximum parsimony because the origin of A/H1N1 is sufficiently recent for homoplasies (recombination or back mutations) to be safely ignored. However, <italic>SeqTrack</italic> genealogies could be optimized on other criteria, such as genetic distances or log-likelihoods based on complex models of sequence evolution (see Methods). Another development of immediate interest relates to the use of diverse genetic information. All analyzes were conducted on the hemagglutinin (HA) segment. The influenza genome comprises eight segments each harbouring one gene. As the A/H1N1 sequencing effort was undertaken independently by a large number of labs, the available genetic information is extremely heterogeneous. Sequences deposited on Genbank for various strains range from small fragments of specific genes to complete genomes, including a majority of strains for which an essentially random combination of segments were sequenced. This translates in a considerable loss of information. <italic>S</italic>uch heterogeneous information could be accommodated by averaging genetic differentiation across segments, using appropriate weights to account for different substitution rates and segment lengths. </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p38">However, including a large fraction of strains with heterogeneous sequencing coverage would require accurate estimates of substitution rates, which can be difficult to obtain for emerging pathogens. Another possible concern is that different segments may exhibit incongruent genealogies due to different selective pressures, reassortments and/or intra-genomic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3642897493">[4]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3800151168">[25]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2464143410">[26]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2149148229">[27]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2056407352">[28]</xref>. Some other developments would require more effort. It would in particular be desirable to consider the various parameters of the model from a probabilistic perspective. For instance, the date of probable transmission could be better captured by a distribution of the time during which a specific sequence remains unaltered rather than a fixed collection date. Moreover, a probabilistic framework would also allow incorporating information besides genetic sequences and collection dates, such as prevalence data or spatial connectivity between locations. </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p39">The 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic is the fourth in modern history. 20<sup>th</sup> century pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968.

However, the main difficulty stems from the current limitation of the available data. The ratio between the number of confirmed and actual cases is likely to vary greatly between countries. Moreover, the number of strains that have been sequenced for each country is uncorrelated with the number of confirmed cases. This leads to considerable difficulties for disentangling the main factors behind the spread of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. What is certain is that human travel must be important. The majority of long distance movement is likely to be mediated by airline travel both for seasonal and pandemic flu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1528575305">[1]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4003802975">[2]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4284081810">[3]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4107853524">[23]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3800151168">[25]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2906081701">[34]</xref>.
