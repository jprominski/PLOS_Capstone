      "                P: Introduction:  Emerging data suggest that receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine may be associated with an enhanced risk of infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1).  We sought to evaluate different seasonal vaccination strategies during a pandemic in the presence of varying levels of pH1N1 infection risk following seasonal influenza vaccine receipt. \n",
      "                P: Methods:  We developed a deterministic, age-structured compartmental model of influenza transmission in the presence of two circulating strains (pH1N1 and seasonal).  We examined the effect of different seasonal vaccination strategies on total influenza-attributable mortality in the Canadian population for the 2009-2010 influenza season.  \n",
      "                P: Results:  Seasonal vaccination strategies that focused on individuals aged ≥65 or delayed seasonal vaccine delivery until January tended to minimize mortality.  In the presence of low levels (<2%) of co-circulating seasonal influenza, mortality estimates were sensitive to the seasonal vaccine-associated relative risk (RR), with small increases in RR resulting in enhanced mortality compared to the no seasonal vaccination option.  Timing of the peak of pH1N1 activity and the amount of circulating seasonal influenza modified the impact of enhanced risk on total mortality.  \n",
      "                P: Discussion:  In the presence of uncertainty surrounding enhanced risk of pH1N1 acquisition with seasonal vaccine receipt, delaying seasonal vaccine delivery or restricting vaccine to individuals aged ≥65 may reduce overall influenza-attributable mortality in the Canadian population.\n",

      "            P: Like any model-based evaluation, our analysis is subject to several important limitations.  As with all mathematical models, this model includes simplifyingassumptions and incorporates parameter values that are subjectto uncertainty, though model calibration to existing data (i.e., assessment of the “fit” between model projections and actual seasonal influenza patterns) was used to validate the model.  Instantaneous administration of vaccine does not reflect the complexity of real-world vaccine programs; however, we would expect this approach to modify the absolute number of deaths observed, but not the relative rank order, compared to the use of a rolling vaccine program in our model.  We did not consider the effect of receipt of seasonal vaccine in previous influenza seasons on enhanced pH1N1 infection risk: if there is a dose-response relationship between seasonal influenza vaccination and pH1N1 infection risk we may have underestimated the impact of seasonal vaccine receipt on pH1N1 risk.  We have made no attempt to evaluate health economic considerations associated with differential vaccination strategies in an atypical influenza season.  Finally, we assumed that there was no modified risk of death among seasonal vaccine recipients in the event that respiratory illness occurred despite infection, though limited evidence suggests that such an effect may exist \n",
      "                Xref: [24]\n",
      "            P: In summary, we have developed an age-structured mathematical model of two circulating influenza strains to examine the effect of a seasonal vaccine-associated risk of pH1N1 acquisition on seasonal vaccination strategies during a pandemic.  This model demonstrates that in the presence of uncertainty, withholding, delaying, or targeting seasonal vaccination to older individuals at highest risk from seasonal influenza-related morbidity is reasonable and may result in a net reduction in influenza-related mortality in the coming year. \n",

Analyzed the data: EA JH CB. Wrote the paper: MD JH.', 'Measuring perceptual judgments about stimuli while manipulating their physical characteristics can uncover the neural algorithms underlying sensory processing. We carried out psychophysical experiments to examine how humans discriminate vibrotactile stimuli.', \"Subjects compared the frequencies of two sinusoidal vibrations applied sequentially to one fingertip. Performance was reduced when (1) the root mean square velocity (or energy) of the vibrations was equated by adjusting their amplitudes, and (2) the vibrations were noisy (their temporal structure was irregular). These effects were super-additive when subjects compared noisy vibrations that had equal velocity, indicating that frequency judgments became more dependent on the vibrations' temporal structure when differential information about velocity was eliminated. To investigate which areas of the somatosensory system use information about velocity and temporal structure, we required subjects to compare vibrations applied sequentially to opposite hands. This paradigm exploits the fact that tactile input to neurons at early levels (e.g., the primary somatosensory cortex, SI) is largely confined to the contralateral side of the body, so these neurons are less able to contribute to vibration comparisons between hands. The subjects' performance was still sensitive to differences in vibration velocity, but became less sensitive to noise.\", 'We conclude that vibration frequency is represented in different ways by different mechanisms distributed across multiple cortical regions. Which mechanisms support the “readout” of frequency varies according to the information present in the vibration. Overall, the present findings are consistent with a model in which information about vibration velocity is coded in regions beyond SI. While adaptive processes within SI also contribute to the representation of frequency, this adaptation is influenced by the temporal regularity of the vibration.', 'Many investigations of sensory processing are based on the principle that the capacity to discriminate between two sensory stimuli must be based upon the difference between their neural representations. Thus, identifying how manipulations of a stimulus alter its percept can help elucidate the neural representation. The present work addresses the nature of neural coding in the somatosensory system: we have conducted psychophysical experiments to identify which features of a vibrotactile stimulus are extracted by the somatosensory system to determine its frequency, and which regions in the somatosensory cortical network are involved in this process.', 'Early investigations focused on the role of neurons in subcortical stations and primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in coding low frequency “flutter” vibrations (below 50 Hz) ', 'If neurons in SI do contribute directly to the comparison of vibrations in a frequency discrimination task, what coding mechanisms might they use? The temporal structure of a vibration is explicitly represented in the precise phase-locked activity of SI neurons ', 'The present experiments also examined a second feature of vibrations that may contribute to perception of their frequency. Based on evidence that monkeys and humans perceive the “intensity” of a vibration to increase with its frequency ', 'If judgments of frequency depend purely on the temporal properties of a vibration, then performance will not be affected by alterations in vibration amplitude. Yet, it has often been assumed that humans and monkeys use the subjective intensity of a vibration, which is sensitive to amplitude as well as frequency, as a cue for frequency ', 'For each of the 6 subjects, the frequency threshold decreased as ', 'Subjects compared the frequency of two vibrations that differed in amplitude (ΔA); the difference between the higher and lower frequency vibrations was either −20%, −13.3%, −6.6%, 0%, +6.6%, +13.3%, or +20%. The examples illustrated are for a 32 Hz and a 40 Hz vibration, with ΔA\\u200a=\\u200a−6.6% and +20%. ', 'Experiment 1 showed that, when judging the frequency of a vibration, subjects used the product of its frequency and amplitude (ie, the rms velocity of the vibration). Experiment 2 again measured the role of amplitude in frequency discrimination, this time in relation to the temporal retention interval separating the to-be-compared vibrations. This manipulation was included based on previous evidence that the involvement of SI neurons decreases progressively as the retention interval extends from 300 to 1200 msec ', 'The results of Experiment 2, shown in ', None, 'We have previously shown that subjects are more accurate at comparing vibrations presented on the same finger than vibrations presented on opposite fingers ', \"The subjects' discrimination thresholds were higher when comparing vibrations on opposite fingers than when comparing vibrations on the same finger (\", None, 'It has been suggested that the phase-locked firing pattern of SI neurons constitutes a neural code for vibration frequency ', None, 'Frequency discrimination was impaired by the addition of noise to the temporal structure of the vibrations (', 'The experiments presented so far suggest that frequency discrimination relies on a network of cortical regions (SI and higher-order areas) and that the vibration features that contribute to the judgment of frequency include rms velocity and temporal structure. The two final experiments in this series employed a 2×2 factorial design to investigate the interaction between somatotopic distance and the presence of temporal noise. The two experiments differed in the availability of rms velocity as a correlate of frequency: in Experiment 5 the vibrations had fixed amplitude such that their rms velocity covaried with frequency; in Experiment 6 the amplitudes were manipulated so that the vibrations had matched rms velocity.', 'In Experiment 5 (see ', \"Results of Experiment 5 in which subjects compared two periodic or two noisy vibrations that were presented to either the same index finger or to opposite index fingers (vertical bars represent within-subject SEM). The vibrations all had fixed amplitude. Frequency discrimination was worse (thresholds increased) if the vibrations were noisy or were presented to opposite fingers, and these two effects combined additively in that the subjects' thresholds were close to that computed to arise from the effects of noise and matched velocity combined independently.\", 'In Experiment 6 (see ', 'Results of Experiment 6 in which subjects compared two periodic or two noisy vibrations that were presented to either the same index finger or to opposite index fingers (vertical bars represent within-subject SEM). The vibrations all had matched rms velocity. Frequency discrimination was worse (thresholds increased) if the vibrations were noisy or were presented to opposite fingers, but these two effects combined sub-additively, in that the effect of noise was smaller when subjects were comparing vibrations on opposite fingers than when subjects compared vibrations on the same finger.', 'These experiments show that the ability of human subjects to compare the frequency of two vibrations is diminished by 3 manipulations: (i) increasing the somatotopic distance between the vibrations; (ii) adjusting the amplitudes of the vibrations to offset differences in their rms velocity (or energy); and (iii) adding noise to the temporal structure of the vibrations. We will discuss each of these effects in turn.', 'The effect of somatotopic distance was reported in our previous work ', 'It is clear that frequency discrimination in humans does not rely solely on SI because, when neurons in SI were excluded from the comparison task through bilateral stimulus presentation, subjects were still able to compare frequency, albeit with lower sensitivity. Thus areas downstream from SI, with bilateral receptive fields, must also contribute to frequency discrimination in humans, as they do in monkeys ', 'The evidence that human subjects used rms velocity as an index of vibration frequency corroborates earlier arguments that frequency perception involves subjective “intensity”, a quality that is sensitive to amplitude ', 'The third manipulation shown to affect frequency discrimination was the addition of noise to the temporal structure of the vibrations. Noise interacted with both of the other factors studied here, somatotopy and rms velocity. First, noise was more disruptive when added to vibrations that had matched velocity than to vibrations with equal amplitude (and thus different velocity). We interpret this to mean that, when differences in rms velocity were available to aid in frequency discrimination, subjects were less sensitive to the effects of temporal noise. This suggests that the coding of rms velocity offers a channel of frequency information that is relatively robust against variability in the temporal structure of the vibration, as might be expected if some temporal averaging is taking place in the representation of velocity (indeed this is implied by “rms”). Second, noise was less disruptive for frequency judgments of vibrations presented on different hands than for vibrations presented on the same finger, as long as the vibrations had matched rms velocity. Therefore, a second coding channel for vibration frequency (distinct from velocity) is particularly sensitive to noise in the temporal structure of the vibrations and appears to be identified with neurons that have unilateral receptive fields, such as characterizes neurons in SI. This is consistent with the neurophysiological evidence from monkeys that neuronal activity in SI is entrained to the pattern of a vibrotactile stimulus – information about vibration frequency could thus be “read off” from this activity, either as the inter-spike intervals ', 'If vibration frequency is, in part, coded by the precise temporal structure of neural activity in SI, an obvious mechanism by which SI neurons could contribute to frequency discriminations would be for those neurons to maintain their phase-locked activity during the retention interval, so that the inter-spike intervals induced by the first vibration could be compared against those induced by the second vibration. Noise in the temporal structure of the vibrations would introduce noise in the inter-spike intervals, thus impairing frequency discrimination. However, numerous neurophysiological investigations by Romo and colleagues uncovered no evidence for sustained activity in SI. Moreover, the response of SI neurons to the second vibration is unaffected by the frequency of the first vibration ', 'Romo and Salinas ', 'Differential engagement of adaptive mechanisms by periodic versus noisy stimulus trains could help explain the range of findings reported here. We postulate that the adaptation of SI neurons during periodic stimulus trains steepens the input-output function relating vibration frequency to firing rate around the frequency of the adapting stimulus, and thereby improves frequency discrimination. A reduction in this adaptation process is responsible for the lower discrimination accuracy with noisy vibrations. If two periodic vibrations are presented to the same finger, such that the second vibration engages the same neurons that have adapted to the first vibration, frequency discrimination thresholds should be particularly low. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging study in humans confirmed that neurons in SI remain adapted to a periodic vibrotactile stimulus across a temporal interval of 600 msec ', \"The proposed adaptation mechanism may also account for the conflicting evidence concerning the effects of noise. While the present experiments have shown that noise degrades frequency discrimination in human subjects, previous studies with monkeys, using a protocol very similar to that employed here, found that the addition of noise to the vibrations had no effect on the monkeys' performance \", \"The current experiments showed that information about vibration frequency was available in two distinct forms: as a representation of the vibration's rms velocity (or energy), which was degraded when velocity cues were removed; and as information that was sensitive to the vibration's temporal structure that could be degraded by noise. Once velocity cues were removed, the impact of noise was larger when subjects compared vibrations delivered to a single fingertip than when they compared vibrations delivered to fingers on different hands. By contrast, rms velocity contributed equally to the frequency discrimination when vibrations were on the same finger or opposite fingers. These observations identify the effects of noise with a representation of vibration frequency in SI, and are consistent with suggestions that the representation of frequency is improved by adaptation of neurons in SI, and that this adaptation process is driven by periodicity of the vibrotactile stimulus. Because evidence for a velocity code was obtained with both single-finger and opposite-finger comparisons, we conclude that this velocity is coded by neurons with bilateral receptive fields, such as in SII. Thus, vibration frequency is coded by multiple mechanisms distributed across multiple cortical regions, and the degree that each mechanism contributes to the perceived frequency depends on the information present in the vibrations and their relative locations on the body.\", \"In Experiments 1, 2, and 4, the subject's right index finger pad rested on a 3-mm diameter steel rod. The rod was driven by a small vibration excitor and power amplifier (Type 4810 “minishaker”, and Type 2718 amplifier, Brüel & Kjaer, Denmark). This setup could only be used to present vibrations to a single finger. Therefore, for Experiments 3, 5 and 6 in which vibrations were presented on opposite fingers, stimulators were built using nickel bimorph wafers (38×19×0.5 mm, length×width×thickness; Morgan Matroc, Bedford, OH, USA). The wafers were individually mounted on plastic blocks, aligned side-by-side and spaced 25-mm apart (center-to-center), housed inside a custom-built case. Vibrations, presented to the pad of one or both index fingers, were transmitted by a 3-mm diameter plastic rod glued to the top face of a wafer. For both types of stimulator, the timing and waveform of the vibrations were controlled from a computer running Labview software (National Instruments, Texas).\", 'The tactile stimuli were 1-sec long sinusoidal vibrations with base frequency of 32 Hz and base amplitude of 280µ. On each trial the subjects compared two consecutive vibrations, separated by a given retention interval, delivered to their right or left index finger. One of the vibrations was 32 Hz; the other varied from trial to trial (according to an adaptive staircase procedure, described below) but was always greater than 32 Hz. The order of the two vibrations was random from trial to trial, and the subjects had to report whether the second vibration frequency was higher or lower than the first. This design ensured that the subjects compared the two vibrations, rather than being able to make a categorical judgment about the frequency of the second vibration independently of the first ', \"Each subject's frequency sensitivity was measured using an adaptive staircase procedure which automatically tailors the task difficulty to individual performance, making the test less vulnerable to ceiling or floor effects, and keeping the task difficulty constant across all experimental conditions.
