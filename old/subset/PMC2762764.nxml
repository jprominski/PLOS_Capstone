Although the epidemiological aspects of the three 20th century influenza pandemics have been widely investigated, little is known about population behaviour in a pandemic situation. Such knowledge is however critical, notably for predicting population compliance with non pharmaceutical interventions. This paper reviews the relevant scientific literature for the 1918-1920, 1957-1958, 1969-1969 influenza epidemics and the 2003 SARS outbreak. Although the evidence base of most non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and personal protection measures is debated, it appears on the basis of past experience that NPIs implemented the most systematically, the earliest, and for the longest time could reduce overall mortality rates and spread out epidemic peaks. Adequate, transparent, and targeted communication on the part of public health authorities would be also of crucial importance in the event of a serious influenza pandemic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p2">The emergence of the novel A/H1N1 virus has made pandemic preparedness a crucial issue for public health worldwide.

Experimental treatments were offered and tested and medical profiteering was not rare. In general, however, the reaction of physicians and nurses appears to have been selfless.

The American Association of Public Health considered face masks the best prophylaxis after isolation, but recognized the difficulty of using them on a broad scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-223121147">[10]</xref>, and in Sydney it was noted that while face masks were compulsory, there were &#x0201c;many fewer&#x0201d; cases of influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1940027190">[11]</xref>.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p13">Regarding the effectiveness of NPIs, the most systematic study identified by the literature search examined 43 cities across the United States with markedly different incidence and mortality rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2056431822">[12]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-684069476">[13]</xref>. Overall, those cities which implemented the largest range of NPIs (as listed above), the earliest, and the longest experienced the least mortality and were able to spread out epidemic peaks. Similarly, a model using historical data from 17 American cities found that those which introduced NPIs the soonest effectively slowed down the progression of the epidemic and reduced cumulative death rates by c. 50%; however, cities implementing NPIs during the first wave were at greater risk of mortality during the second <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3117078257">[14]</xref>.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p14">NPIs were not successful in all countries.

In Leipzig, it was felt that social restriction measures and recommendations for personal protection were of little avail in slowing the course of the epidemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3744104706">[16]</xref>. While encouraging and/or enforcing NPIs, the public health authorities were not oblivious to their impact on the economy and, ultimately, on social welfare (notably through job and income loss).

Indeed, some went as far as to say that the harm brought about by NPIs may even have &#x0201c;outweighed their possible good effect&#x0201d;, in particular owing to the dislocation/paralysis of trade and loss of employment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2021742059">[19]</xref>.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p15">1.2 Consequences of the pandemic on the general population</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p16">Regarding the effectiveness of NPIs, one of the difficulties was public compliance.

In Canada, the health authorities distributed leaflets to passengers in several languages, introduced compulsory screening (interviews), and installed infrathermal scanning machines. But, according to one author, screening effectiveness was necessarily limited by the fact that travel time to Canada from any point in the world is less than twenty-four hours, thus making the detection of a case during incubation highly unlikely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1453725272">[44]</xref>. On the other hand, a mathematical model seeking to evaluate measures taken to reduce the international spread of SARS found that border screening had been about 10% effective, whereas the distribution of information had played only a minor role. The authors of this study argued that an effectiveness of even 10% could provide up to a week&#x02019;s delay in spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2610865728">[45]</xref>.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p25">Quarantine was also widely used. In Taiwan, 150,000 people were quarantined of whom only 24 were subsequently found to have laboratory-confirmed SARS. Quarantine proved to be effective in improving onset-to-diagnosis time and limiting infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3666484837">[46]</xref>. In Singapore, the military was involved in enforcing home quarantine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2805912116">[47]</xref>. Long historical experience has shown quarantine to be one of the only measures that can be taken in face of a lethal outbreak, but it is usually painful for those involved. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorders are known to affect certain quarantined people, prompting suggestions that in such situations emotional support be provided by public health authorities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-676443147">[48]</xref>. A web-based survey of 129 people quarantined for SARS in Taiwan indicated that only 68% of respondents understood the reasons for quarantine (not related to educational level), that a mere 30% felt they had received adequate information, and that adherence to control measures was suboptimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4038555513">[49]</xref>. A major problem associated with quarantine is potential financial hardship especially for disadvantaged socio-economic groups, and the effects on the economy owing to absenteeism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2217312129">[50]</xref>.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p26">In Hong Kong, mass education regarding SARS appears to have been relatively effective&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1380469972">[51]</xref>and in Singapore, information and education was regularly delivered through press conferences, public talks, hotlines, and websites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3920545858">[52]</xref>. A survey conducted on nearly 600 people attending polyclinics found that poor awareness of SARS was associated with older age, blue collar workers, housewives, and those living in three- or fewer-room flats. After logistic regression, the most significant predictor of poor awareness of the disease was educational level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1374950683">[53]</xref>. According to another study, women, 30-49 year-olds, and those with primary education only experienced the greatest anxiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1108370605">[54]</xref>.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p27">3.2 SARS and health care workers</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p28">Most health care workers (HCWs) involved in the treatment of SARS patients found themselves in a totally novel situation: their job had suddenly become potentially life-threatening and many were cut off from their usual social environment (either due to their own isolation or fear of contagion on the part of friends and family). The compliance of HCWs was critical in the effort to prevent nosocomial spread and &#x0201c;leakage&#x0201d; of infection back into the general population. Beyond the actual hospital building characteristics (e.g. self-contained emergency room), the importance of developing and adhering to infection control programmes has been widely stressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3420410238">[55]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2707193918">[56]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2792444864">[57]</xref>. Personal and patient protection could be problematic: two surveys conducted on HCWs and medical students in Hong Kong revealed that hand-washing was recognized as being effective, but that compliance was low. Reasons included suboptimal promotion (by hospital management) of prevention measures and a greater preoccupation with self-protection than with patient protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-877288275">[58]</xref>. At the French Hospital in Hanoi, precautionary behaviour on the part of HCWs was seen to increase as the outbreak progressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2568320555">[59]</xref>. A large study of HCWs (n = 14,554) in five different settings in Singapore concluded that communication programmes capable of reaching all levels of HCWs were necessary to address the large number of factors determining the appropriate use of protective equipment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2870831600">[60]</xref>. Indeed in Vietnam, a retrospective survey found that compared to HCWs who always wore a mask, those who never did had a 12.6-fold higher risk of developing SARS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2551347457">[61]</xref>. Analysis of the SARS outbreak in Canada has underlined the importance not only of personal protection but also of moral support for HCWs and patients exposed to a potentially lethal infection. Given the shortage of staff, nurses were obliged to work up to 2 to 3 shifts in a row. Yet despite their key role in caring for patients, they were given &#x0201c;a minimal voice in drafting internal policies and procedures as to how to deal with the SARS epidemic&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1345418204">[62]</xref>. One author commented on the necessity for hospital psychiatric departments to develop epidemic response plans in conjunction with hospital administration, given the psychological management necessary for both patients and staff during a lethal outbreak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-449466097">[63]</xref>. Some have concluded that the greatest limitation in the response to the SARS outbreak was the absence of coordinated leadership, stressing the importance of communication between the critical care community, hospital management, government, and public health officials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1603640340">[64]</xref>.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p29"><bold>4.

Cleary, public trust has been influenced over the years by how authorities deal with health problems and emergencies and, in the event of a serious influenza pandemic, appropriate communication tailored to specific groups will be critical to disease control (Table 3). If we are to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best, the 1918 experience should be considered when planning for a &#x0201c;future&#x0201d; pandemic. Major changes since the deadly 1918 pandemic include our capacity to detect cases rapidly, improved health care, access to care, targeted pharmaceuticals, and overall coordination. Yet we still face major difficulties in predicting the transmission dynamics of influenza, its local impact, and population compliance with prophylactic measures. Today, as then, the authorities will seek by various means to mitigate panic in the interest of disease control. Today, as then, shortages of HCWs &#x02013; for a variety of reasons &#x02013; are to be expected. Today, as then, business profiteering could occur, especially on the web (sales of &#x0201c;falsified&#x0201d; pharmaceuticals, protection gear, and vaccines as well as &#x0201c;miracle&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; remedies). Public behaviour is likely to be similar in some respects (waning compliance with prevention measures as fear declines), but it is difficult to determine the respective effects on the population of the on-going &#x0201c;war effort&#x0201d; (in 1918) and a heightened perception of personal health and exposure to risk (today). Suboptimal adherence to prevention measures as a function of risk perception has been noted, or at least discussed, with regard to diseases such as HIV-AIDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4194498189">[98]</xref> or Chikungunya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3365966100">[99]</xref>. Other major differences between 1918 and today include legal interpretations of privacy and civil and constitutional rights (for example, issues related to mass vaccination or post-pandemic law suits regarding resource allocation and alleged or real vaccine adverse events), but also improved base-line understanding of health messages. Finally, probably the single most important difference between today and then is access to information via the media and the Internet. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, people can find out what measures are being taken in other countries and this could lead to increased public demand, warranted or unwarranted criticism of public health policies, and conflicting perceptions of &#x0201c;fairness&#x0201d; of interventions and resource allocation. </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p126"><bold><italic>Table 3.
