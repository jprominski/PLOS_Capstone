The rats were housed in polycarbonate cages in a barrier system maintained at 20–25°C with 40–70% relative humidity, a 12 h light-dark cycle, and a room air exchange of 10–20 times per hour. The feeding density was three rats per cage after dosing. Rats had ad libitum access to the certified rodent diet, and sterilized municipal tap water was given ad libitum through water bottles. Each rat was given a unique number and identified by its ear tag and animal number. All rats neither had previous procedures nor abnormal clinical conditions before the study.\n",

The most prominent characteristic of a metal nanoparticle is that, as a carrier, it could enhance the organ enrichment of ions [], which also allows its extensive application in targeted cancer treatment and biomedical imaging technology. On the other hand, nanoparticles could take a long period to clear once they accumulated in the organs, and they may have a toxic effect in persistence[, ]. Thus, the concerns have been raised on the potential risk of using nanoparticles in medical applications. In recent years, accumulating evidence has shown toxicities induced by AgNP in various  experimental models, such as alveolar macrophages [], neutrophils [] and also sertoli and granulosa cells [].

By contrast, in a 28-day inhalation toxicity study (1.32\\\\u00d7 10 AgNP /cm), no changes on bodyweight, hematology and blood biochemical parameters of  (SD) rats were observed []. Another study also suggested that SD rat oral gavage with up to 36 mg/kg AgNP for 13 weeks showed no obvious change in histopathology, hematology, serum chemistry, micronuclei, and reproductive system parameters []. The toxicities that resulted from the different administration routes often varied due to the subsequent distribution patterns. For example, in a single-dose oral administration study [], the tissue distribution of Ag in the liver, kidneys, and lungs was higher when Ag was administered compared with AgNP. Whereas intravenously administered AgNP predominantly accumulated in the liver and spleen, and the free Ag were subsequently released and excreted, and most of which were deposited in the kidneys, lungs, and brain [].

The impact of particle size to the AgNP\\\\u2019s toxicity on cell death and cell cycle progression has been reported previously [, ]. Particle size plays an important role on the uptake kinetics of NPs in the cells []. Our results showed that the Ag were predominantly accumulated in the lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys of rats dosed with AgNP, suggesting the AgNP transferred and accumulated into specific target organs where they may further generate Ag. However, for the animals dosed with the Ag alone, the concentration of Ag was undetectable in all organs, probably due to the lower dose of Ag administration. As reported previously, AgNPs were prone to accumulate in the liver, lungs, and kidneys []. After a single .. injection, AgNP distributed into the pulmonary circulation system, and thus predominately accumulated in the lungs, which could potentially lead to chronic lung toxic effects with extended administration period. Due to the short study period, however, we didn\\\\u2019t observe acute lung toxicity induced by AgNP. A recent study [], nevertheless, has showed evident vascular injury could be induced by a 7 day repeated pulmonary exposure of AgNP (20 nm). The liver and kidneys were the targets of AgNPs in rats via oral administration [\\\\u2013], and the TEM data demonstered that the AgNPs were able to penetrate into the liver cells, with the AgNPs tended to bind to proteins around 25\\\\u201370 kDa. The potential systemic toxicity of AgNPs remains controversial. In general, oral administration of AgNP showed no obvious organ toxicity in subacute toxicity studies [\\\\u2013]. However, high concentrations of AgNP in the circulatory system may cause severe toxicities[]. For instance, intravenously administration of AgNP at 20 mg/kg and above in Wistar rats exhibited significant changes in WBC count, platelet count, hemoglobin, and RBC count, and the levels of liver function enzymes (including ALT, AST, ALP, GGT and TBil) were elevated when 40 mg/kg of AgNP were injected []. The maximum blood concentration of AgNP was previously measured as 1 \\\\u03bcg/ml with a bioavailability of 4.2% while orally administrated at 10 mg/kg in rats []. As such, in our study, the plasma concentration of AgNP after a single .. dose with 5 mg/kg of AgNP is estimated to be about 125 \\\\u03bcg/ml. Similarly, the study showed that the toxic effects in the liver and kidneys were observed 48 h after .., and the increased ALT, BUN, TBil and Cre levels implied the appearance of acute liver and kidney injuries in SD rats. Moreover, lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration were revealed as the key observations for AgNP induced morphological changes [, ], in addition to cell degeneration, regeneration and necrosis. Nanoparticles introduced inflammation and immune response while interacting with the tissues, which is also a key mechanism of nanotoxicity. Therefore, the mild irritation observed in the spleen and thymus was proposed to be associated with the immune recognition process.\"}, {\"xref\": [{\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref031\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"31\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref032\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"32\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref033\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"33\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref034\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"34\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref035\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"35\"}], \"sup\": [\"+\", \"+\", \"+\"], \"italic\": [\"i\", \"v\"], \"#text\": \"AgNP could enter the human body by digestive tract, respiratory tract, skin or blood vessel, and introduce injuries in liver, kidneys[], lungs []and central nervous system[].

Another study focused on the potential cardiac toxicity of nano materials and demonstrated that both AgNP and Ag could trigger severe myocardial conditions in mice at dosages above 6 mg/kg.

Some previous studies suggested that the Ag, not the nanoparticles, were responsible for the major toxic effects of AgNPs [, ]. Most of the toxic effects caused by AgNP were contributed by the dissolved Ag [], and the possible mechanisms include activation of lysosomal acid phosphatase activity, disruption of actin cytoskeleton and stimulation of phagocytosis, increase of MXR transport activity, inhibition of Na-K-ATPase, . An exquisitely designed study[] ruled out the particle-specific effect of AgNP, since the AgNP showed negligible cytotoxicity to bacteria when synthesized and tested under strict anaerobic conditions to preclude the release of Ag. Recent o studies further pointed out that the toxicity of AgNP is mainly depend on the intracellular release, but not the silver ions liberated in the culture medium [, ]. However, Lin et al\\\\u2019s study reported that the lethal bradyarrhythmias could be generated at the presence of AgNP, and further suggested that AgNP was the one contribute to their gross acute toxic effect on myocardial  and  channels, as the released Ag was estimated to be less than 0.02%[]. In addition, the organism-specific immune response induced by nanoparticles should not be underestimated. Our recent KEGG pathway analysis implied that inflammatory signal pathways in rats can be affected by AgNP but not by ionic Ag alone. It further suggested that inflammatory response may be important for AgNP induced toxicity []. The enhanced toxicity produced by AgNP observed in our study, by contrast with the toxicity generated by Ag, is in accordance with both the higher dose and the organ enrichment feature of AgNP.\"}, {\"italic\": [\"in vitro\", \"in vivo\"], \"xref\": [{\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref001\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"1\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref011\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"11\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref016\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"16\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref013\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"13\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref013\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"13\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref002\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"2\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref029\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"29\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref043\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"43\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref044\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"44\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref045\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"45\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref014\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"14\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref046\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"46\"}], \"sup\": [\"+\", \"+\", \"+\", \"+\", \"+\"], \"sub\": \"2\", \"#text\": \"The genotoxicity of AgNP has been universally evaluated  [, ]. The Ames test result of AgNP was negative, which might be due to the bacterial being is incapable of endocytosis, whereas the effects on inducing micronuclei formation and DNA breakage was discovered. Few studies have examined the  genotoxicity of AgNP so far, and it is innovative to focus on the extra effects of the nanoparticle itself. Our data demonstrated that both AgNP and Ag produced certain chromosome damages to the bone marrow cells, which were mainly in the form of chromosome or chromatid breakages. Although it is thousands of times less concentrated, such effect is more significant in those injected with Ag, implying Ag, besides the nanoparticle is the fundamental cause of the gap, breakage, and exchange in chromatid and chromosome. The AgNP-induced delay of the cell cycle from G0/G1 to S phase using golden hamster embryo cell model has been previsouly observed[]. These data altogether suggested that the AgNP might reinforce the chromosomal damage of Ag together with its effects on the cell cycle []. The possible mechanism of AgNP-induced genotoxicity was involved with the interruption of ATP synthesis, subsequent to the disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and excess production of serum reactive oxygen species (ROS) [].The genetic materials is susceptible to oxidative free radical attacks induced by the metal nanoparticles []. Elevated serum ROS can be measured in Wistar rats treated with AgNP, and the single-cell gel electrophoresis data had a significant tail migration []. In addition, evidence showed that the AgNP might interact with the DNA directly by disrupting the hydrogen bonding between DNA double strand, and affect its conformation change in calf thymus []. Furthermore, the occurrence rate of polyploidy was significantly higher in AgNP group suggested additional genotoxicity induced by AgNP, which was very likely associated with the nanoparticle itself but not the ions. In contrast, the reduced polyploidy rate in Ag group might be due to the increased chromosome fragmentation. AgNP-induced increased polyploidy rate has been reported previously [, ], but has not been highlighted in studies with other metal nanoparticles. Kim et al. showed that AgNP participates in the ROS-induced genotoxicity, which plays important role in mediating DNA and chromosome instability, as well as mitosis inhibition []. The increase of polyploidy cells was also suggested to be associated with the activation of the G/M DNA damage checkpoint and ATR/p53/p21 signaling, which can be rescued by an antioxidant treatment []. Hence, AgNP-promoted polyploidy formation may relate to the oxidative stress triggered by its interaction with DNA or chromosomes in the cells.\"}, {\"xref\": [{\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref003\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"3\"}, {\"@rid\": \"pone.0185554.ref047\", \"@ref-type\": \"bibr\", \"#text\": \"47\"}], \"#text\": \"Although we failed to detect the differences of micronucleus rates between the control and AgNP group, a single intravenous exposure to AgNP (5 or 10 mg/kg bw) produced significantly increased micronuclei frequency at 24 h after exposure, and this increase can also be observed 1 and 4 weeks later [], implying the potential risk of AgNP continuously present in the body. A recent study also showed that SD rats orally administered with AgNP for consecutive 5 days at a range of 5 to 100 mg/kg demonstrated a significant increase of the frequency of micronuclei formation [].

Taken our data and previous studies together, it is rational to speculate that a lower dose of AgNP with extended exposure period could essentially accumulated in targeted organs and produce chronic toxicity. Furthermore the risk of carcinogenicity may also increase. Major concerns on AgNP\\\\u2019s safety assessment at present are its persistence and disposition in the targeted organs and the subsequent toxicities, which necessitates a chronic toxicity study or carcinogenicity study to follow. The distribution of AgNPs in animals can be identified by, for instance, a recently developed method using gold nanocluster as fluorescence probes []. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the underlying distribution, targeted organs and genotoxicities particularly generated by AgNP in SD rat models. The specific toxicities and potential carcinogenic effect induced by nanoparticles need to be further investigated in a chronic toxicity study. For example, a AgNP carinogenic test using C57-ras transgenic mouse model, which are currently performing by our team, might be included.\"}}, {\"@sec-type\": \"supplementary-material\", \"@id\":
