      "                P: Introduction:  Emerging data suggest that receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine may be associated with an enhanced risk of infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1).  We sought to evaluate different seasonal vaccination strategies during a pandemic in the presence of varying levels of pH1N1 infection risk following seasonal influenza vaccine receipt. \n",
      "                P: Methods:  We developed a deterministic, age-structured compartmental model of influenza transmission in the presence of two circulating strains (pH1N1 and seasonal).  We examined the effect of different seasonal vaccination strategies on total influenza-attributable mortality in the Canadian population for the 2009-2010 influenza season.  \n",
      "                P: Results:  Seasonal vaccination strategies that focused on individuals aged ≥65 or delayed seasonal vaccine delivery until January tended to minimize mortality.  In the presence of low levels (<2%) of co-circulating seasonal influenza, mortality estimates were sensitive to the seasonal vaccine-associated relative risk (RR), with small increases in RR resulting in enhanced mortality compared to the no seasonal vaccination option.  Timing of the peak of pH1N1 activity and the amount of circulating seasonal influenza modified the impact of enhanced risk on total mortality.  \n",
      "                P: Discussion:  In the presence of uncertainty surrounding enhanced risk of pH1N1 acquisition with seasonal vaccine receipt, delaying seasonal vaccine delivery or restricting vaccine to individuals aged ≥65 may reduce overall influenza-attributable mortality in the Canadian population.\n",

      "            P: Like any model-based evaluation, our analysis is subject to several important limitations.  As with all mathematical models, this model includes simplifyingassumptions and incorporates parameter values that are subjectto uncertainty, though model calibration to existing data (i.e., assessment of the “fit” between model projections and actual seasonal influenza patterns) was used to validate the model.  Instantaneous administration of vaccine does not reflect the complexity of real-world vaccine programs; however, we would expect this approach to modify the absolute number of deaths observed, but not the relative rank order, compared to the use of a rolling vaccine program in our model.  We did not consider the effect of receipt of seasonal vaccine in previous influenza seasons on enhanced pH1N1 infection risk: if there is a dose-response relationship between seasonal influenza vaccination and pH1N1 infection risk we may have underestimated the impact of seasonal vaccine receipt on pH1N1 risk.  We have made no attempt to evaluate health economic considerations associated with differential vaccination strategies in an atypical influenza season.  Finally, we assumed that there was no modified risk of death among seasonal vaccine recipients in the event that respiratory illness occurred despite infection, though limited evidence suggests that such an effect may exist \n",
      "                Xref: [24]\n",
      "            P: In summary, we have developed an age-structured mathematical model of two circulating influenza strains to examine the effect of a seasonal vaccine-associated risk of pH1N1 acquisition on seasonal vaccination strategies during a pandemic.  This model demonstrates that in the presence of uncertainty, withholding, delaying, or targeting seasonal vaccination to older individuals at highest risk from seasonal influenza-related morbidity is reasonable and may result in a net reduction in influenza-related mortality in the coming year. \n",
