The rats were housed in polycarbonate cages in a barrier system maintained at 20–25°C with 40–70% relative humidity, a 12 h light-dark cycle, and a room air exchange of 10–20 times per hour. The feeding density was three rats per cage after dosing. Rats had ad libitum access to the certified rodent diet, and sterilized municipal tap water was given ad libitum through water bottles. Each rat was given a unique number and identified by its ear tag and animal number. All rats neither had previous procedures nor abnormal clinical conditions before the study.\n",
