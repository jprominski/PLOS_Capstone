Their abundance, protein composition and metabolic function vary depending on the cell type and adjust to different intracellular and environmental factors such as oxidative stress or nutrition. The biogenesis and proliferation of these important organelles are regulated by proteins belonging to the peroxin (PEX) family. PEX3, an integral peroxisomal membrane protein, and the cytosolic shuttling receptor PEX19 are thought to be responsible for the early steps of peroxisome biogenesis and assembly of their matrix protein import machinery. Recently, both peroxins were suggested to be also involved in the autophagy of peroxisomes (pexophagy). Despite the fact that distribution and intracellular abundance of these proteins might regulate the turnover of the peroxisomal compartment in a cell type-specific manner, a comprehensive analysis of the <italic>endogenous</italic> PEX3 and PEX19 distribution in different organs is still missing. In this study, we have therefore generated antibodies against <italic>endogenous</italic> mouse PEX3 and PEX19 and analysed their abundance and subcellular localisation in various mouse organs, tissues and cell types and compared it to the one of three commonly used peroxisomal markers (PEX14, ABCD3 and catalase). Our results revealed that the abundance of PEX3, PEX19, PEX14, ABCD3 and catalase strongly varies in the analysed organs and cell types, suggesting that peroxisome abundance, biogenesis and matrix protein import are independently regulated. We further found that in some organs, such as heart and skeletal muscle, the majority of the shuttling receptor PEX19 is bound to the peroxisomal membrane and that a strong variability exists in the cell type-specific ratio of cytosol- and peroxisome-associated PEX19. In conclusion, our results indicate that peroxisomes in various cell types are heterogeneous with regards to their matrix, membrane and biogenesis proteins.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></funding-source><award-id>KLIFO 181, Project 3; Ba 2465/1-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8265-3763</contrib-id><name><surname>Baumgart-Vogt</surname><given-names>Eveline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation, DFG), Klinische Forschergruppe 181 (Clinical Research Unit, KFO 181): Male factor infertility due to spermatogenesis defects, Project 3, Impact of peroxisomal metabolism in germ and Leydig cells on overall testis functions and male fertility, Ba 2465/1-2 and Leistungsorientierte Mittel der Justus Liebig University (Output oriented Financial support of the Justus Liebig University of Giessen).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="35"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles that can either be formed <italic>de novo</italic> or multiply by fission [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The proliferation of peroxisomes, the assembly of their membrane and the import of peroxisomal matrix enzymes into the organelle are regulated by proteins belonging to the family of peroxins (PEX-proteins) [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In yeast, mice and humans, more than 32 different genes coding for peroxins have been identified, which are either integral part of the peroxisomal membrane or soluble cytosolic receptors [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein</ext-link>). Though many key players of the peroxisomal biogenesis have been already discovered 25 years ago, the question on how they functionally interact and how peroxisomes are formed <italic>de novo</italic>, how their membrane is generated and how they divide by fission is still not fully clarified [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Two peroxins were identified and intensively studied that interact and closely cooperate during the initial steps of yeast [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and mammalian [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] peroxisome biogenesis, namely PEX3 and PEX19 [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cells in which these peroxins had been depleted, lacked peroxisomes and complementation studies showed that the re-introduction of the respective gene into the knock-out background could restore <italic>de novo</italic> peroxisome biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The role for PEX3 and PEX19 in the formation of peroxisomes is the insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) into the membrane of the nascent organelle [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the initial steps of peroxisome formation, PEX19 binds PMPs in the cytosol through a peroxisomal membrane-targeting signal (mPTS) consisting of a PMP-binding domain and a membrane-anchoring domain [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. PEX19 could also function as a chaperone, aiding the correct folding of PMPs [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The latest theory on how peroxisomes form <italic>de novo</italic> in yeast suggests that PEX3 might be autonomously integrated into the membrane of the ER from which PEX3-loaded pre-peroxisomal vesicles arise [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A more recent publication proposes that in mammalian cells <italic>de novo</italic> peroxisomal biogenesis begins with the budding of PEX3-loaded pre-peroxisomal vesicles from the mitochondrion, followed by their maturation to peroxisomal vesicles in the ER [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The exact mechanism is, however, not fully understood and still matter of debate [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. PEX19 targets the bound PMPs to pre-peroxisomal vesicles and inserts them into the peroxisomal membrane by docking to PEX3 [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These initial steps of peroxisome biogenesis lead to the integration of peroxisomal substrate transporters into the membrane and to the assembly of the machinery necessary for the import of matrix proteins. This import complex consists of other proteins of the peroxin family (e.g. PEX14) and initiates the loading of the newly formed peroxisomes with soluble matrix enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Enzymes that are imported into the peroxisomal matrix take part in different metabolic pathways such as the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids or the synthesis of glycerolipids and cholesterol precursors [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Despite the fact that peroxisomes of different organs share certain common features, the organelle&#x02019;s proteome is fine-tuned depending on the metabolic demand of the organ or cell type [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example: peroxisomes of the liver and of the proximal tubules of the nephron, the organs in which peroxisomes were first described, contain high amounts of catalase. For this reason catalase has been used as marker enzyme in many studies performed on peroxisomes in the past years. The amount of peroxisomal catalase, however, can vary between cell types [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and low catalase content does not necessarily correlate with a less developed peroxisomal compartment [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Differential protein expression depending on the cell&#x000b4;s developmental and nutritional state was also found for the peroxisomal membrane transporter ABCD3 [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Peroxins play a key role in regulating the turnover of peroxisomes and are therefore likely to be differentially expressed in different organs depending on metabolic requirements. Moreover, peroxisomes in different cell types vary in their morphological appearance from round to rod-shaped to tubular and network-like [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], changing the relative matrix to membrane volume ratio, which might also affect the quantity of peroxins associated with the peroxisomal membrane [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Although intensive investigations have been made to study the function of PEX3 and PEX19 in model organisms such as the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> little is known about their organ-specific distribution and function in mammalian cells and organs [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, besides cell culture studies, endogenous PEX3 and PEX19 have not yet been investigated in mammalian organs. Determining presence and amount of these proteins in different organs and specific cell types could provide an indication on early biogenesis steps, proliferation state and turnover rate of their peroxisomes. Since PEX3 and PEX19 are involved in peroxisome biogenesis, we expected their highest expression in organs whose cells either contain a large number of peroxisomes such as liver and kidney or with a high rate of peroxisome remodelling and renewal. For this reason, organs and cell types containing high amounts of PEX3 and PEX19 could be more frequently negatively affected by defects of the peroxisomal biogenesis such as occur in diseases of the Zellweger syndrome spectrum and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Patients affected by these devastating hereditary disorders do not possess functional peroxisomes [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], which results in systemic metabolic dysfunctions that lead to multiple organ defects and early death of the affected children [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Indeed, mutations in the <italic>PEX3</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and the <italic>PEX19</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] genes lead to the most severe form of the peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, the Zellweger syndrome.</p><p>In the past years, we have tested out several antibodies against PEX3 and PEX19 that all did not give satisfactory results for morphological stainings of the endogenous proteins. Therefore, we have generated anti-PEX3 and anti-PEX19 antibodies specific and sensitive enough to analyse organ- and cell type-specific distribution and abundance of these peroxins <italic>in situ</italic>. Our results showed that PEX3 and PEX19 protein abundance and mRNA expression were differentially regulated in different organs and cell types. We also found that organs in which common peroxisomal marker proteins were highly expressed or that contained a large number of peroxisomes did not necessarily display high levels of PEX3 and PEX19 and that the ratio between peroxisomal membrane-associated and cytosol-located PEX19 conspicuously varies between different organs and cell types. In conclusion, organ- and cell type-specific adaptations of the peroxisomal protein composition do not only concern their metabolic but also their peroxisome biogenesis proteins (peroxins), which do not seem to be regulated in a strictly orchestrated manner but rather independently from each other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>For the isolation of the organs, 3 male 19 weeks-old C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the central animal facility (Zentrales Tierlabor&#x02014;ZTL) of the Justus Liebig University of Giessen.

For catalase one single band of 64 kDa was detected in liver, heart, colon and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183150.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). By far the highest expression of this enzyme was found in the liver, as expected, and in the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183150.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The predicted molecular weight for PEX14 is 34 kDa, however, it previously has been shown that the protein runs at about 60 kDa (57 kDa) in Western blots of liver homogenates [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A protein band of approximately 60 kDa can be detected in liver, heart, colon and testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183150.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In the colon, we additionally detected a smaller band of the predicted molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa. The appearance of two protein bands on Western blot analysis of PEX14 has been already shown in studies using enriched peroxisomal fractions from different areas of the newborn mouse brain [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Western blot analysis of the enriched peroxisomal fractions using the anti-PEX3 antibody resulted in the detection of a strong 32 kDa band in spleen, lung, jejunum, kidney and testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183150.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). In liver, skeletal muscle and brain (frontal neocortex) this protein band was less abundant and in pancreas, heart and colon the band was only visible after longer exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183150.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). In addition to the 32 kDa band, a strong band of 70 kDa could be visualized in most organs except liver and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183150.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Opposite to what was previously suggested for purified PEX3 protein, loading the sample without boiling to 95&#x000b0;C in either the presence or the absence of SDS [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] did not dissolve the 70 kDa band (data not shown). Also the addition of different concentrations of urea (0.25, 1 and 4 M) did not solubilize the 70 kDa band but instead increased its intensity (data not shown). SOD2 was not detected in any of the organs indicating that the enriched peroxisomal fractions were essentially free from detectable contaminations with mitochondrial matrix proteins.</p><p>PEX19 is a soluble protein that is mainly located in the cytosol [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. To investigate the tissue-specific subcellular localisation of this protein, we therefore used a peroxisome-depleted fraction, containing mainly microsomes and cytosolic proteins, which we obtained during the subcellular fractionation of the whole organ lysates. The Western blot analysis for PEX19 revealed a band of the expected size of approximately 35 kDa in the peroxisome-depleted fraction of all analysed organs except liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183150.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). As expected, using antibodies against PEX3 and PEX14 next to no signal could be detected in the peroxisome-depleted fraction. Labelling of the same fractions using the anti-catalase antibody detected a very faint protein band of the expected molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa in lung, testis and skeletal muscle only after extended exposure of the Western blot membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183150.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Also, no SOD2 was detected in the peroxisome-depleted fractions except for the samples derived from spleen, probably a result of mitochondrial lysis during the isolation procedure. This demonstrates that homogenization and differential centrifugation of the organs under our experimental conditions did not result in leakage of the peroxisomes or fragmentation of their membrane.</p><p>Although PEX19 is mainly located in the cytosol, a small percentage (5%) was reported to be present in the peroxisomal membrane in rat liver extracts [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Isoform 2 lacks the first exon and 40 bp of the second exon and is 2855 bp long (the corresponding protein contains 207 aa). The 3&#x000b4; and 5&#x000b4;untranslated regions are identical. We designed <italic>Pex19</italic> isoform 1 specific qPCR primers to investigate the percentage of <italic>Pex19</italic> isoform 1 to the total <italic>Pex19</italic> mRNA expression.

During these experiments we noticed that i) labelling of PEX3 in paraffin sections was difficult in comparison to the one of other peroxisomal biogenesis proteins such as PEX14 due to its low abundance and ii) it was difficult to visualize the peroxisome-bound form of PEX19 by fluorescence microscopy in tissues in which the cytosolic-associated form was strongly labelled.

The clear PEX14 staining of the peroxisomes of the neuropil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183150.s004">S4C Fig</xref>) could not be achieved using the anti-PEX3 antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183150.s004">S4B Fig</xref>) due to the low abundance of this protein in the neuronal processes.</p><p>The immunofluorescence staining for PEX19 appeared to be much stronger than the one observed for PEX3.

Inside the perikaryon, both cytosolic and peroxisomal staining could be observed, hinting to a double localisation of PEX19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183150.s004">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>). Interestingly, mainly the cytosol around the nucleus of the perikaryon was stained, where also most of the peroxisomes are localised.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Discussion</title><p>PEX3 and PEX19 are indispensable peroxins, which coordinate the early steps of peroxisomal biogenesis. Depletion of these peroxins, independently of each other, causes complete loss of peroxisomal function [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview on the organ- and cell type-specific distribution and subcellular localisation of the peroxins PEX3 and PEX19 in mice. We first generated antibodies against both proteins and proved their specificity using knock-down and overexpression experiments. Based on the stainings with these antibodies, our results sustain the hypothesis that the abundance of PEX3 and PEX19 might influence organ-specific characteristics of peroxisomes (number, size and proliferation rate). For PEX19, the regulation of its subcellular localisation could be an additional factor that affects peroxisome biogenesis, maybe by controlling the shuttling frequency of PMPs to the peroxisomal membrane. We further showed that the abundance of the peroxins PEX3, PEX19 and PEX14, of the membrane transporter ABCD3 and of the matrix enzyme catalase is not necessarily regulated in a concerted manner, highlighting that peroxisomal biogenesis, number, enzymatic content and metabolite transporter composition are regulated independently of each other.</p><sec id="sec029"><title>PEX3 and PEX19 are differentially expressed in mouse tissues</title><p>Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles but are particularly abundant in hepatocytes or the proximal tubules of the kidneys. Because of the close interaction between PEX3 and PEX19, which is necessary for the development of functional mature peroxisomes, at the beginning of this study we speculated i) that organs containing high number of peroxisomes or large quantities of catalase (e.g. liver and kidney) would also contain the largest amounts of PEX3 and PEX19 and ii) that the expression of these closely interacting peroxins would be concertedly regulated. We have therefore compared the distribution of PEX3 and PEX19 to each other and to PEX14, ABCD3 and catalase, which all are well established and frequently used peroxisomal markers [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. PEX14 is part of the peroxisomal membrane-docking complex that is required for the translocation of matrix proteins [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is inserted by PEX3 and PEX19 into the peroxisomal membrane [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. PEX14 has been shown to be an optimal marker for the visualisation of the number of peroxisomes within individual cells and for comparison of the peroxisomal compartment of different cell types due to its high and constant abundance within the peroxisomal membrane [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183150.t001">Table 1</xref> we have summarised our findings for PEX3 and PEX19 with respect to the staining intensities and subcellular localisation in organ specific cell types (for a comparison to PEX14 see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183150.s011">S7 Table</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183150.t001">Table 1</xref> exemplifies the highly divergent distribution of these peroxins in mouse organs. The intracellular levels of PEX3 and PEX19 are neither always linked to the number of peroxisomes inside a particular cell type nor is their amount always regulated synchronically. For example, in hepatocytes that notoriously contain large amounts of peroxisomes (stained strongly for catalase, ABCD3 and PEX14) neither PEX3 nor PEX19 where highly expressed as shown by the Western blotting, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis. The opposite was true for heart and skeletal muscle. In comparison to hepatocytes, both cardiac and skeletal myocytes do neither possess such a large number of peroxisomes [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] nor contain high levels of the marker enzyme catalase [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Nevertheless, in myocytes we found high levels of the PEX3 and PEX19 coding mRNAs and protein. In other cell types containing a large number of peroxisomes, such as Leydig cells in the testis or epithelial cells of proximal tubules in the kidney, also the abundance of PEX3 and PEX19 was high. Interestingly, the abundance of PEX3 and PEX19 does not only vary in relation to catalase or peroxisomal abundance, but also in relation to each other. In hepatocytes and epithelial cells of the excretory duct of the pancreas in which PEX3 was very low abundant the peroxisome-bound PEX19 form was present in relatively high amounts. On the other hand, enterocytes, which display high amounts of PEX3 contain only very little cytosolic PEX19. A similar discrepancy was also observed between the abundance of PEX3 and PEX19 in comparison to the one of PEX14. In this study we showed that while the protein abundance of PEX3 and PEX19 greatly varied, the abundance of PEX14 was comparable in nearly all the analysed organs. The differences in the cell type-specific level of peroxisomal biogenesis proteins hint to distinct modulation and fine-tuning of the processes underlying early peroxisome biogenesis and peroxisomal homeostasis. We hypothesize that these adjustments are made in dependence to the differentiation level, metabolism and nutritional and oxidative status of the individual cell types.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0183150.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183150.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of intensity and particularities of the PEX3 and PEX19 immunofluorescence staining.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0183150.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0183150.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" style="background-color:#808080" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Organ</th><th align="center" style="background-color:#808080" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cell type</th><th align="center" style="background-color:#808080" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PEX3</th><th align="center" style="background-color:#808080" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Staining particularities</th><th align="center" style="background-color:#808080" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PEX19</th><th align="center" style="background-color:#808080" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Staining particularities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="8" colspan="1"><bold>Kidney</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mesangial cells</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(-)po</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(-/+)cyt;

A dual subcellular localisation of PEX19 has been described in earlier publications in yeast [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as well as in mammalian CHO-K1 cells and fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], but so far has not been analysed in detail in different organs. Our immunofluorescence analysis of various mouse organs revealed strong variations of the PEX19 protein abundance. Moreover, the amount/ratio of PEX19 localised in peroxisomes and cytosol strongly varied depending on the analysed cell type and organ. In most organs the cytosolic form of PEX19 predominated, corresponding well to previous calculations that indicate that 95% of PEX19 is cytosolic in rat liver [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, in some organs like heart, skeletal muscle or pancreas and spermatogonia in testis, the peroxisome-bound form of PEX19 was particularly high abundant and could easily be detected on top of the cytosolic PEX19 staining. Similar differences were noticed between the MEFs and Hepa 1&#x02013;6 cells. The dual subcellular localisation of PEX19 is a reflection of its function as a shuttling receptor that targets membrane proteins to the peroxisome by docking to PEX3. However, no studies so far are available on the factors that might influence the ratio of peroxisome-bound to cytosolic PEX19.</p><p>Interestingly, the Western blot analysis of the peroxisomal fractions suggests, that the dual subcellular localisation of PEX19 could be connected to a molecular weight shift. Analysis of the peroxisomal fractions revealed a 40 kDa band (liver, testis and brain) and a 50 kDa band (liver, heart, kidney, testis and skeletal muscle) but no band of the expected size of 35 kDa. When we then analysed the immunofluorescence stainings, we found that the parenchyma of the organs displaying a 50 kDa band contained a clear peroxisomal staining that could be visualized next to the cytosolic labelling. High apparent molecular weight for PEX19 has been reported previously in gel filtration experiments in which the protein eluted at around 100 kDa instead of 34 kDa due to its non-globular structure [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and in Western blot analyses of total lysates derived from cell-culture and plant seedlings of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> where the protein was detected as a dimer [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Closer inspection of the Western blot results published by Hadden <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] shows that next to the monomeric 30 kDa band and the dimeric 60 kDa band, a number of other products were recognised by the PEX19 antibody in the range between 40 kDa and 55 kDa [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> contains two isoforms of PEX19 that are both expressed at the mRNA level, which might contribute to the formation of dimers and heterodimers [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Like <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> also mice contain two differently sized PEX19 isoforms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>): isoform <italic>a</italic> with 299 aa and <italic>b</italic> with 207 aa. The expression of two PEX19 mRNAs is however most likely not the cause for the differently sized PEX19 protein products. Albeit the transient peroxisomal association of PEX19 was described previously for mammals [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and yeast [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], so far this double localisation has never been linked to the formation of dimers or the occurrence of PEX19 isoforms. It would be interesting for future investigations to analyse the nature of these differently sized proteins and to determine their exact subcellular localisation.</p><p>Conflicting evidence exists regarding the function of the PEX19 farnesylation at amino acid C347 [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. It was suggested that this modification was required for peroxisomal targeting of PEX19 [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], a result that was disclaimed later by other reports [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Though the farnesylation does not largely influence the molecular weight of a protein <italic>per se</italic>, it might change the lipid binding properties and therefore the behaviour in the SDS-PAGE. Indeed, farnesylation greatly increases the hydrophobicity of proteins changing both subcellular localisation and binding properties [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. A very recent paper suggested that the farnesylation of PEX19 triggers the insertion of the hydrophobic hairpin-domain containing protein UBDX8 into phospholipid monolayers on the surface of a lipid-droplet and postulated ER subdomains [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Ultrastructural analysis will be required to determine the exact nature of these postulated ER subdomains and whether these subdomains are indeed integral parts of the ER-network or subdomains of the peroxisomal membrane compartment [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] containing farnesylated PEX19. We speculate that differences in the subcellular localisation of PEX19 could be due to differences in the rate of farnesylation, e.g. in case of low farnesylation, non-farnesylated cytosolic PEX19 is predominant, whereas at high rates of farnesylation, the farnesylated PEX19, which is localized in the peroxisome is more abundant.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Possible scenarios for the PEX3- and PEX19-mediated regulation of the peroxisomal homeostasis in different cell types</title><p>It is an emerging concept that peroxisomal metabolism and proliferation respond to microenvironmental factors including nutrient supply, oxidative stress and hypoxia and that peroxisomes cross-talk with other organelles for the exchange of metabolic intermediates [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In response to these stimuli the abundance of the peroxisomal compartment changed rapidly by either proliferation or degradation [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], which are regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Transcription factors that regulate peroxisome proliferation are the nuclear receptors of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family (PPAR&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. PPARs modulate fatty acid metabolism and are regulated by a variety of short lipid ligands [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] by binding to PPAR response elements (PPRE) located in target genes. Experiments showed that they activate the transcription of genes coding for peroxins, peroxisomal transporters as well as &#x003b2;-oxidation and antioxidative enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. A PPAR-peroxisome-loop has been suggested for maintaining the PPAR-ligand homeostasis by a feed-back mechanism of peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation genes [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. PPARs are variably regulated in different tissues and organs and could therefore generate an organ-specific peroxin expression profile by transcriptional control. To investigate the possible regulation of the <italic>Pex3</italic> and <italic>Pex19</italic> genes by PPARs, we have analysed the intergenic region upstream of the transcriptional start using a prediction program developed for the identification of PPREs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.classicrus.com">www.classicrus.com</ext-link>) and found putative PPAR&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; binding sites in the gene of <italic>Pex19</italic>, but none in <italic>Pex3</italic>. This could explain why the abundance of PEX3 and PEX19 is independently regulated although both protein are involved and linked to each other during the early steps of peroxisome biogenesis. However, the functionality of these regulatory elements needs to be experimentally determined in future studies.</p><p>Peroxisomal homeostasis is regulated not only by their proliferation, but also by their degradation via pexophagy and other mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Pexophagy is a subtype of autophagy and is induced by different events such as hypoxia through hypoxia-inducible factor 2&#x003b1;-mediated signalling or oxidative stress through ataxia telangiectasia mutated-mediated signalling [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Interestingly, both PEX3 and PEX19 were suggested to be involved in pexophagy. It was recently shown that the overexpression of PEX3 induces ubiquitination-dependent NBR1-mediated pexophagy [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and that PEX19 associates with the tuberous sclerosis complex, which is part of the signaling cascade downstream of ATM activating pexophagy in the presence of ROS [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Next to pexophagy, also peroxisome proliferation is activated by oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] and we therefore expected high expression of PEX3 and PEX19 in organs that are exposed to higher ROS levels. However, while the amount of PEX3 and PEX19 in kidney was notable, the expression of these peroxins in the lung or liver, which are also exposed to high levels of oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0183150.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], was very low. At the moment, it is still unclear how PEX3 and PEX19 contribute to either peroxisome biogenesis or pexophagy in dependence to different ROS levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Conclusions and outlook</title><p>In this article we show that the abundance of the closely interacting peroxins PEX3 and PEX19, but also of PEX14, peroxisomal membrane transporters and matrix enzymes, are not regulated in a concerted manner. This indicates that they are differentially controlled by organ- and cell-type-specific signalling networks, which are yet to be identified. Future experiments will clarify how the intracellular levels of PEX3 and PEX19 are differentially modulated in the context of their implication in both peroxisome proliferation and degradation via pexophagy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183150.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title><italic>Pex3</italic> and <italic>Pex19</italic> mRNAs are particularly highly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle and lung.</title><p><bold>A and B:</bold> qPCR analyses of <italic>Pex3</italic> (A) and <italic>Pex19</italic> (B) mRNAs using cDNA synthesised from total RNA derived from different mouse organs (as indicated).
