		<d><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The eastern economic hub of Shanghai received its first deliveries of gas from China's newly opened East to West pipeline that runs some 4,000 kilometres (2,400 miles) from the Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region, state press reported Friday. "What counts most is that the advent of gas symbolises the successful operation of the whole project," the Shanghai Daily quoted Zhao Yongxin, a PetroChina employee as saying. The country's biggest oil firm, PetroChina, has financed the 4.0 to 5.2-billion-dollar pipeline expected to carry some 12 billion cubic metres (420 billion cubic feet) annually for some 30 years. PetroChina's foreign partner's Royal Dutch/Shell Group, ExxonMobil and Russia's Gazprom withdrew from the project in September after an initial agreement fell apart. The pipeline is central to China's energy policy shift away from reliance on coal to cleaner burning gas, which is intended to supply up to 10 percent of the country's fuel consumption by 2020. China wants to reduce its reliance on coal and imported oil, trying to access more natural gas as part of efforts to shore up its energy supplies and clean up its filthy environment. Xinjiang's Tarim Basin has estimated gas reserves of 8.4 trillion cubic metres, of which 658 billion cubic meters have been verified, according to state press.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Japanese government lobbied the US government to influence the decision by Royal Dutch/Shell and Unocal Corp. to withdraw from a disputed Chinese gas project in the East China Sea, a report said Friday. Japan told the oil majors via Washington that investment would be risky and the planned gas field was located in areas disputed between Tokyo and Beijing, the Mainichi Shimbun daily said without citing sources. Japanese officials declined comment on the report. "On matters that involve private firms, we would like to refrain from commenting, including whether there was such contact as reported," said a foreign ministry official dealing with energy issues. He declined to be named. A US embassy spokesman also declined comment. Pecten Orient, a Royal Dutch/Shell subsidiary, and Unocal Corp. said this week they would not go ahead with five contracts to explore, develop, and market natural gas resources in the Xihu trough, near Japan's territorial waters or exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Tokyo has voiced concern that China's project could draw resources in Japanese territory via underwater pipelines. At the same time Tokyo has also launched a controversial survey for natural gas near the Chinese project and a group of disputed islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan. Japanese Trade Minister Shoichi Nakagawa said Japan will continue its project. "I understand that (the firms) have decided to pull out because the project would not pay," he told reporters earlier this week. "Japan would not be affected by their decision and the survey within our EEZ will continue."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BEIJING, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Millions of Chinese were on the move Friday at the start of the annual week-long National Day holiday. China's mid-autumn "Golden Week" kicked off with huge crowds of people milling around tourist sites and shopping areas in Beijing and other large cities. Beijing, a city of 13 million, expected its streets to be crammed with shoppers and tourists and was struggling to control the crowds. There were chaotic scenes on the sidewalks around Tiananmen Square in the heart of the city early Friday, as thousands of tourists thronged the area, unaware the square itself had been sealed off. The square was scheduled open later in the day, and municipal authorities expected it to eventually hold a quarter of a million people, according to the Beijing News. China has three week-long holidays a year, and each has evolved into an opportunity for prosperous urbanites to spend their hard-earned cash. In one untraditional measure of holiday-related consumption, Chinese media reported the number of extra make-shift public toilets added to major tourist attractions in preparation for the crowds. The Summer Palace, a vast park area in the northwest of Beijing, set up 42 additional toilets, while the popular Great Wall section at Badaling outside the capital made do with just four, said the Beijing News. While trains remained the favorite mode of transport, many members of the nation's newly-affluent middle classes were traveling by plane. The Xinhua news agency reported that 2.5 million Chinese were expected to go by plane during the holiday Over the coming seven days, a total of 2,400 departures will be added to the normal flight schedule, Xinhua reported, quoting the civil aviation administration. That decision would be welcome news to policy-makers who have in recent years portrayed the week-long holidays as a measure to encourage people to spend more freely rather than keeping their savings idle in the bank. To ensure holiday-makers would not suffer cash shortages, major banks said many outlets would be open during the week, according to the Shanghai Daily. The law enforcement authorities also said they were on the look-out for any trouble. Beijing SWAT teams had been holding "anti-terrorism exercises" and were expected to be at any of the city's 250 large shopping centers within five minutes in the event of a serious incident, reports said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Kookmin Bank, South Korea's biggest retail bank, is expected to post a handsome profit for the third quarter to September despite the fallout from its accounting scandal, its outgoing president said Friday. "The bank is expected to post a net profit for the third quarter which is almost similar in size to the overall total for the first two quarters," Kookmin Bank pesident Kim Jung-Tae said. "There has also been improvement in various indicators for its financial health," said Kim, who is to bow out at the end of this month, in his last monthly speech to employees. In the first half to June, the nation's biggest lender posted a net profit of 307 billion won (267 million dollars). The bank attributed the improvement to lower default and delinquency rates and fewer provisions for loan losses. The bank suffered a 341 billion won net loss in the third quarter last year because of huge loan losses incurred from the financial problems that engulfed credit card companies and SK Global, the bankrupt trading arm of SK Group. The Financial Supervisory Commission last month issued a "disciplinary warning," the most severe punitive action against bank officials, accusing Kim of accounting irregularities. Under commission regulations, Kim, much credited for setting an example in turning around debt-laden banks, will be banned from serving as an executive of any domestic bank for three years. The punishment follows a separate decision by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to fine Kookmin Bank two billion won (1.7 million dollars) for accounting irregularities last month. Kookmin was then found to have evaded taxes by overstating by 550 billion won (479 million dolllars) the losses of Kookmin Card Co., a troubled credit card subsidiary Kookmin Bank absorbed in September last year. Yonhap news agency said many bank officials viewed Kim's punishment as retaliation for his "uncooperative attitude" toward the government's handling of troubled companies and financial institutions. Kim openly opposed government-led bailouts of financially troubled companies, including the country's largest credit card firm, LG Card Co., last year.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush, Kerry, clash on Iraq in first debate.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CORAL GABLES, Florida, Sept 30 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Senator John Kerry charged Thursday that President George W. Bush made "a colossal error in judgment" by invading Iraq, as they clashed in a high-stakes debate that may decide their battle for the White House. As tens of millions of Americans watched the televised confrontation, Bush countered that Kerry was undermining US credibility in the war on terrorism with "mixed messages" about whether toppling Saddam Hussein was worth the cost. "What message does that send our troops. What message does that send to our allies. What message does that send the Iraqis." the Republican incumbent asked. "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein." Iraq and national security dominated as the two candidates battled over how to stabilize that war-torn country, where more than 1,000 US soldiers have died amid deadly chaos that shows no sign of ebbing. Kerry threw the first punch in the political prizefight by confidently declaring "I can do a better job" on Iraq and on averting another terrorist attack like the September 11, 2001 strikes. He also charged Bush unecessarily diverted resources from the hunt for Osama bin Laden to the war in Iraq, saying: "This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president." "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein," said the president, who painted his rival as fickle on crucial national security issues, noting he voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002 but against war funding in 2003. "We're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens," said Bush. "You cannot lead if you send mixed messages." "I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat. There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way. And the president chose the wrong way," countered the Massachusetts senator. Kerry has accused Bush of fracturing alliances and damaging US credibility and global standing in the rush to war; Bush has charged Kerry is more worried about worldwide popularity than protecting the United States. Before the confrontation started, the Republican and Democratic rivals shook hands and exchanged tense smiles before taking cover behind matching lecterns. Kerry, a four-term senator, has trailed in polls that indicate that undecided voters may be open to a change of president, but have yet to warm to him. Bush would settle for a draw, but hoped to build on a five-to-eight point edge in national polls and leads in many of the battleground states expected to decide one of the most hard-fought elections in recent US history. The debate, the first of three, came after the latest Iraqi tragedy. At least 49 people to the North Korean nuclear crisis -- Bush warning against Kerry's call for bilateral talks -- and to Iran's moves to develop a nuclear program. But both agreed that the most serious threat to US national security was the possibility that terrorists like Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network might get their hands on nuclear materials. And Kerry and Bush called the violence sweeping through Sudan's troubled Darfur region "genocide" while saying they opposed sending US troops there. There was no mention of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, though both men agreed stabilizing Iraq was in Israel's interest, and the president later expressed his surprise that there had been no question about Cuba. "I've got a plan to spread freedom, not only in the greater Middle East, but in our own hemisphere, in places like Cuba," said Bush, who told a cheering crowd that his policy was "Cuba libre" (free Cuba). Kerry and Bush will have a second debate, on October 8 in St. Louis, Missouri, and finish with a session on domestic policy October 13 in Tempe, Arizona. Vice President Dick Cheney and Kerry's Democratic running mate, John Edwards, will hold a single debate on October 5 in Cleveland, Ohio. The series of televised faceoffs was scheduled after weeks of negotiations on the most minute aspects of the event, including the height of podiums, the temperature of the room and allowable camera angles.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA["We won" the debate, Democrats crow, "No, we did," say Republicans.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CORAL GABLES, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Jubilant Democrats boasted late Thursday they had seen the next president of the United States -- and his name was not George W. Bush. But true to form, Republican supporters of the President branded his opponent Senator John Kerry a waffler and a feather for each political wind, after the bruising, first presidential debate at the University of Miami. Fierce partisanship was to be expected from "spin teams" who fanned out like Pied Pipers as soon as the debate, consumed by differences over Iraq, was over. But Kerry's backers, looking for a boost for his second place campaign were convinced their man had done enough to jolt the White House race back to life, and claimed Bush looked edgy and defensive. "The people got to see the 44th President of the United States," said Tad Devine, a senior Kerry strategist. Outspoken Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry Mcauliffe claimed Kerry came out as the statesman of the pair, while Bush looked like "an ostrich who has his head in the sand." "The President was outed tonight," he said. Retired General Wesley Clark, vanquished by Kerry earlier this year in the Democratic Party primaries, rejected Republican attempts to paint the veteran Massachusetts Senator as indecisive. "There was no waffling, there was nothing indecisive there, that has been a canard that was hanging out there that has never had any real basis. "That John Kerry you saw tonight, that is the authentic John Kerry. "That is the man who is going to be our next president and he is going to be a great president." Republican spin meisters, on the back foot from early anecdotal claims that Kerry had won the debate despite Bush's opinion poll lead, claimed the president's opponent had once again been exposed as indecisive. "This debate showed that John Kerry is once again willing to say almost anything that suits his political moment," said top Bush advisor Karen Hughes. "Whenever the news becomes slightly difficult, he immediately becomes the anti-war candidate." Former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani also stuck the boot in. "It was just one contradiction after another, I honestly don't even know what his position is any more." "I am even more confused now after the debate than I was before." Bush's political guru Karl Rove said it was Bush that came across as the statesman, and not Kerry. "The President made the point that we're a safer country and the world is safer because Saddam Hussein has been removed from power. President Bush believes that, John Kerry doesn't."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indonesia took a confident step towards full democracy Friday, swearing in legislators elected in landmark polls to a newly-reformed bicameral parliament free from military representation. In a ceremony witnessed by outgoing President Megawati Sukarnoputri, 550 members of the upper House of Representatives and a 128-strong senate-style Regional Representatives Council took oaths to serve their country. Supreme Court chairman Bagir Manan presided over the swearing-in of the two chambers, which make up the National Consultative Assembly -- the first fully elected parliament with no military and police representation. The ceremony marks the culmination of democratic reforms which began after the resignation of military-backed dictator Suharto in 1998 and led to the country's first ever direct presidential elections last month. Previously the national assembly was made up of 500 members of the House of Representatives, 200 people representing the regions and interest groups including the military and police. Legislators, including a former actress and a one-time Miss Indonesia, pledged to work as "fairly and justly as possible" for their country. "I will struggle for the aspirations of the people and regions that I represent," they said in unison. Unlike previous elections in which people voted only for parties, this year's polls allowed voters to choose both parties and individual legislative candidates representing their areas. In another historic vote on September 20, Indonesians overwhelmingly elected to replace Megawati with general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who is due to take office on October 20.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[CORAL GABLES, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Main points from the presidential debate here late Thursday between US President George W. Bush and Democratic candidate Senator John Kerry: IRAQ Bush: "In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. "In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough. It's hard work. It's incredibly hard. You know why. Because an enemy realizes the stakes. The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. That's why they're fighting so vociferously. "The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. We've got a plan to do so. And the main reason we'll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free. "I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place. What message does that send our troops. What message does that send to our allies. What message does that send the Iraqis." Kerry: "This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment (in Iraq). And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America. "I know I can do a better job in Iraq. I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table. We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections. "The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it. "And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make. You don't take America to war unless you have the plan to win the peace. "This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened on there. But it's getting worse by the day. More soldiers killed in June than before. More in July than June. More in August than July. More in September than in August." NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION Bush: "I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network. And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer. "And we've been effective. We busted the A.Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. "I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses. We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly." Kerry: "Nuclear proliferation (is the most serious threat to US security). There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11." NORTH KOREA Bush: "I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea. It's precisely what (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Il wants. It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons. It's a big mistake to do that. "Now there are five voices speaking to (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Il, not just one. And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doincisely what we did in Liberia. We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out. Kerry: "With respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold. "Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And that's going to require more than is on the table today. "But I'll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda. It's the moral responsibility for us and the world." CHARACTER AND LEADERSHIP Bush: "My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq. He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. "You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens. Kerry: "Let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with. Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't. But this issue of certainty. It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong. "It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy onship that is good. This is a very important country to us. We want a partnership. But we always have to stand up for democracy."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US and Iraqi forces poured into the insurgency stronghold of Samarra, seizing the troublespot's government building and police stations, the military said in a statement early Friday. The attack amounted to the first major effort by US and Iraqi forces to reclaim a rebel enclave in the Sunni Muslim triangle ahead of nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for January. "In response to repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces, Iraqi Security Forces and Multi-National Forces secured the government and police buildings in Samarra early in the morning of October 1 in support of the Iraq Interim Government and the people of Samarra," the military said. US troops and one batallion each from the Iraqi army and national guard stormed the city pre-dawn Friday after a previous arrangement signed on September 9th for US forces to enter the town and patrol peacefully fell apart one week ago. The violence flared Thursday night when US soldiers spotted three speed boats unloading explosives at 6:00 pm (1400 GMT) on the bank of the Tigris river, said Master Sergeant Rober Powell from Tikrit. A gunfight ensued and several insurgents were killed, Powell said. Insurgents in a boat then fired off mortars into the city and US forces opened fire, killing four of them at 7:09 pm, he added. Loud explosions started to shake the town at 9:00 pm, Samarra residents said. Within hours, US troops stormed the heart of the city, with armored vehicles rumbling down the street and AC-130 helicopter gunships roaring overhead. Sporadic clashes erupted through the early morning, Powell said. Peaceful efforts to end the standoff between insurgents and US forces in Samarra unraveled on September 23rd when US troops sealed off the city, including a crucial bridge over the Tigris. The blockading of the city shattered a peace agreement reached between the sides that allowed US forces to return to the city on September 9th after a three-month absence from Samarra. The failed peace deal had been viewed as taking Samarra away from the brink of a major US assault to reclaim it from insurgents who had turned the city into a no-go zone for the Americans. But as soon as US troops resumed patrolling in Samarra, they immediately came under successive attacks, climaxing in a September 22 ambush from a mosque that canceled the fragile truce agreement and ushered in the latest phase of violence.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell Friday vigorously denied that its withdrawal from a politically sensitive gas project in the East China Sea was due to pressure from the Japanese government. "The project did not meet our commercial criteria," Nick Wood, a Shell spokesman told AFP, explaining that the decision that the decision was purely a commercial one. According to a report in the Mainichi Shimbun, Japan told the oil majors via Washington that their investment would be risky as the planned gas field was located in an area disputed between Tokyo and Beijing. Japanese officials declined comment on the report in Tokyo. "On matters that involve private firms, we would like to refrain from commenting, including whether there was such contact as reported," said a Japanese foreign ministry official dealing with energy issues.

The area is near Japan's territorial waters or exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and Tokyo has voiced concern that China's project could draw resources in Japanese territory via underwater pipelines. Tokyo in turn has launched a controversial survey for natural gas near the Chinese project and a group of disputed islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan. Japanese Trade Minister Shoichi Nakagawa has said Japan will continue its project. "I understand that (the firms) have decided to pull out because the project would not pay," he told reporters earlier this week. "Japan would not be affected by their decision and the survey within our EEZ will continue."

		<c><![CDATA[The testosterone all but fizzed off the screen into America's living rooms as President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry refused to cede an inch in a beefy presidential debate. Despite rigid rules supposed to stifle spontaneity, genuine debate did its best to break out, as Bush and Kerry fired rhetorical darts over Iraq, and the post-September 11 global anti-terror campaign. Bush, who has built a career on an aura of decisiveness, gave immediate notice he planned to dominate -- marching out of the wings to reach Kerry's side of the red-carpeted stage for a ceremonial handshake. That may have been a choreographed bid to offset the supposed advantage Kerry was given in the minds of voters looking for reassurance in a hostile world, by his superior height, at 1,93 meters (six foot-four) to the president's 1.80 meters (five-foot-eleven). Bush, schooled through addresses to Americans in times of grave national peril, peered straight into the camera as he gave his answers -- literally looking the nation in the eye. Kerry however spent most of his time pleading his case to debate moderator Jim Lehrer, and not directly into the lens, with a slight side-on posture as he answered. He did however directly address viewers in his final statement, promising to "look you in the eye and say to you I defended this country as a young man in war and I will defend it as President of the United States." He ended the debate in the Convocation Hall at the University of Miami with the presidential valediction, "God Bless America," reflecting his main task for the evening -- proving he is fit to serve in the Oval Office. "The people got to see the 44th President of the United States," claimed Tad Devine, a senior Kerry strategist. Regulations hammered out by both campaigns were supposed to prevent direct interaction between the candidates -- Democrats whispered because the president wanted to avoid going toe-to-toe with the rhetorically gifted Kerry. But it was Bush who turned the tables twice on his opponent, first demanding 30 extra seconds of time to rebut Kerry's fierce criticism of his perceived lack of leadership over Iraq. And he then broke the rules by responding directly to a Kerry claim that he had not made America safe from terrorists, drumming out his promise in resolute prose. "I again want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home. But you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and brings them to justice before they hurt us again." Kerry, seeking to bury his reputation as a windy speaker, spoke for the most part in short, clipped sentences and clauses, avoiding for the most part avoiding complicated constructions. And seeking to prove to Americans he is fit for higush advisor Karen Hughes. Unlike previous presidential debates, there was little levity, as both candidates sparred in what both obviously believed was a time of national emergency for their country. But both did compliment one another on their families, each have two daughters, and Kerry paid tribute to First Lady Laura Bush. The debate took place in a strange vacuum, with no laughter, gasps or applause, in line with the strict groundrules set for the debate. Moderator Jim Lehrer told the audience before the debate went on air that they were there only to "bear silent witness" and ordered "no hissing, no booing, no cheering, no crying."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Democratic challenger John Kerry won the first televised presidential debate against Republican President George W. Bush late Thursday, according to instant polls released after. A Gallup poll for CNN gave Kerry a 46 percent to 37 percent win over the president. It added that 46 percent of those asked now have a better opinion of Kerry against 21 percent for Bush. The CBS network, which asked 200 voters, said 44 percent gave victory to Kerry against 26 percent who thought the president had the upper hand. Thirty percent said neither candidate won. An ABC poll of 531 people gave 45 percent for Kerry, 36 percent for Bush and 17 percent for a draw. But the survey said Bush still had the support of 51 percent of voters for the November 2 election against 47 percent for Kerry.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Stand-off continues over North Koreans at Canada's Beijing embassy.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BEIJING, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[More than 40 North Koreans were holed up inside the Canadian embassy in Beijing for a third day Friday after Canada refused China's demand to hand them over. The men, women and children who scaled an embassy fence using ladders on Wednesday could face a lengthy wait for an end to the stand-off as China goes into a week-long holiday, a mission spokesman said. "Today is National Day, and we have entered into a period when many officials are away from their posts," said embassy spokesman Ian Burchett. "We'll have to wait for this period to be finished, and then we'll go back at it." Canada had earlier rejected China's request to hand over the group, who "will remain in the compound for the time being", according to foreign ministry spokeswoman Kimberly Phillips in Montreal. Forty-four men, women and children -- all believed to be North Koreans -- scaled a three-meter (ten-foot) fence surrounding the Canadian embassy on Wednesday in an apparent attempt to secure political asylum. One of the 44 was receiving hospital treatment outside the embassy compound for injuries suffered while trying to get over the fence, according to the embassy. "That individual is still at the facility receiving medical care under the watchful eye of Canadian embassy staff," Burchett said. For the 43 remaining in the embassy, life had entered into some sort of routine, he said. A TV set had been rolled into the multi-purpose room where they were being accommodated and they had been provided with Korean-language books. Embassy officials had also gone shopping to buy puzzles and crayons for the six children in the group. Similar situations have occurred at the Canadian embassy here twice in the past two years, but each time only two North Koreans have gained access to the compound. In recent years, scores of North Koreans have won political asylum in South Korea after they successfully entered diplomatic missions in China. Earlier in September, 29 asylum seekers broke into the compound of Japan's embassy-run school and at least some of them have since been discreetly spirited out of the country. Nine North Korean women were handed over to Chinese police this week after seeking asylum at the American school in Shanghai. Joseph Caron, the Canadian ambassador in Beijing, told CTV television in an interview: "The fact of the matter is there have been many such cases here in Beijing and even other parts of China as well." However, fueling concerns that Beijing might consider the current case differently, Assistant Foreign Minister Shen Guofang on Thursday told reporters that China wanted Canada to hand over the 44. Foreign observers were debating if this remark should be interpreted as a change of Chinese tactics on an issue that has become an increasing embarrassment in the relationship with North Korea. "We'll have to wait and see," a foreign diplomat in Beijing said Friday. "China has always said that it doesn't consider North Koreans to be refugees at all." Some governments fear harsh reprisals for North Korean asylum-seekers who are sent back to their impoverished country.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A group of pro-democracy activists staged a noisy protest Friday as thousands of Hong Kong residents joined in celebrations marking the 55th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. A flag-raising ceremony and an official reception took place in the morning to commemorate the founding of communist China in 1949. But before the festivities began, a dozen protesters led by the newly-elected pro-democracy legislator Leung Kwok-hung staged a march calling for the release of political prisoners in China. Carrying a black coffin symbolising the death of democracy, the activists waved anti-China banners and shouted "End One Party rule". They marched to the Golden Bauhinia Square where a monument marks the formerly British-ruled city's handback to China in 1997. But the protesters and Leung, nicknamed "Long Hair" because of his waist-length tresses, were barred by about 50 policemen from moving on to the site of the flag-raising ceremony attended by 3,000 guests. At an official reception, Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa said the city's economy would remain the focus of his government. "The Hong Kong government will continue to. strengthen the economy, ensuring its continuing growth. We have to take advantage of the speedy growth in the mainland, allowing more citizens to benefit from it," he said. The Beijing-backed leader said the territory was on course to eventually move towards full democracy. "The government will. push for democracy in Hong Kong in order to reach the ultimate goal of universal suffrage," he said. Leung, who was invited to the reception as he is a legislator-elect, shouted "Long Live Democracy" but that did not interrupt Tung's speech. Friday's celebrations include a carnival on Hong Kong Island, featuring a police marching band, traditional dances and cultural performances. A fireworks display was scheduled to take place Friday night along the Victoria Harbour and was expected to draw more than 400,000 people, according to the police. Friday also marks the first day of the autumn "Golden Holiday" in China, an annual seven-day national holiday created to boost mainland tourism. The government estimated that 560,000 mainland travellers would be visiting Hong Kong during the week, taking advantage of relaxed travel restrictions.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush says direct talks with North Korea a big mistake.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CORAL GABLES, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush said late Thursday that direct talks with North Korea would play into the hands of its leader, Kim Jong-Il, who wants to blunt efforts to halt his state's nuclear weapons programme. Bush clashed with Democratic challenger Senator John Kerry about how to counter the nuclear weapons threat from North Korea and Iran -- both part of Bush's so-called "Axis of Evil" -- during their first presidential debate. Both agreed though that nuclear proliferation is the biggest threat facing the United States. Kerry has proposed direct talks between the United States and North Korea on all topics of discord between the Cold War rivals. But Bush said, "I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is to have bilateral talks with North Korea. That's precisely what Kim Jong-Il wants." The US leader said bilateral negotiations would cause current six nation talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons "to evaporate". Three rounds of talks involving North Korea, the United States, China, Russia, South Korea and Japan have been held. But the North has refused to join a fourth session. Some experts have said North Korea is waiting to see the result of the November 2 US election before returning to talks. for two years after. "While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out, and today there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea," said Kerry. "I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues from the armistice of 1953, the economic issues, human rights issue, artillery disposal issues, DMZ (demilitarized zone) issues and nuclear issues on the table," Kerry said. Bush said he hoped international efforts could also "convince the Iranians to abandon their nuclear ambitions." He said the United States had worked very closely with Britain, France and Germany on an initiative to push Iran away from its suspected nuclear weapons drive. "I hope we can do it and we've got a good strategy," Bush said of the effort being fought through the International Atomic Energy Agency and which the United States wants to see taken to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions. orth Korea has built six nuclear weapons."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush, Kerry, clash on Iraq in presidential debate.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CORAL GABLES, Florida, Sept 30 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Senator John Kerry charged Thursday that President George W. Bush committed "a colossal error" by invading Iraq, as they clashed in a high-stakes debate that may decide their battle for the White House. As tens of millions of Americans watched the televised confrontation, Bush countered that Kerry was undermining US credibility in the war on terrorism with "mixed messages" about whether toppling Saddam Hussein was worth the cost. "What message does that send our troops. What message does that send to our allies. What message does that send the Iraqis." the Republican incumbent asked. "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein." Iraq and national security dominated as the two candidates battled over how to stabilize that war-torn country, where more than 1,000 US soldiers have died amid deadly chaos that shows no sign of ebbing. Kerry went into the debate needing a strong performance and some instant polls straight after said he had beaten the president. A Gallup poll for CNN gave Kerry a 46 percent to 37 percent win over the president. Kerry threw the first punch in the political prizefight by confidently declaring "I can do a better job" on Iraq and on averting another terrorist attack like the September 11, 2001 strikes. He also charged Bush unnecessarily diverted resources from the hunt for Osama bin Laden to the war in Iraq, saying: "This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president." "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein," said the president, who painted his rival as fickle on crucial national security issues, noting he voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002 but against war funding in 2003. "We're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens," said Bush. "You cannot lead if you send mixed messages." "I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat. There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way. And the president chose the wrong way," countered the Massachusetts senator. Kerry has accused Bush of fracturing alliances and damaging US global standing in the rush to war; Bush has charged Kerry is more worried about worldwide popularity than protecting the United States. Before the confrontation, the Republican and Democratic rivals shook hands and exchanged tense smiles before taking cover behind matching lecterns. Kerry, a four-term senator, has trailed in polls that indicate that undecided voters may be open to a change of president, but have yet to warm to him. Bush hoped to build on a five-to-eight point edge in national polls and leads in many of the battleground states expected to decide one of the most hard-fought elections in recent US history. The first of the three debates went ahead amid mounting chaos in Iraq. At least 49 people were killed there, dozens of them children, in three nearly simultaneous car bomb attacks Thursday. US and Iraqi forces poured into central Samarra early Friday to seize the troublespot's government building and police stations in an attempt to beat back the insurgency, the US military said. "This president, I don't know if he sees what's really happened on there. But it's getting worse by the day," said Kerry. "If we lose our will, we lose. But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy," said Bush. The candidates' different styles were on display early. Kerry sought to back up policy proposals with statistics and details while Bush countered with broad principles he said fueled his outlook. Amid signs of slipping US public support for his policy towards Iraq, Bush sounded defensive, and frequently shot annoyed glances at Kerry, who iy was "Cuba libre" (free Cuba). Kerry and Bush will have a second debate, on October 8 in St. Louis, Missouri, and finish with a session on domestic policy on October 13 in Tempe, Arizona. The televised faceoffs was scheduled after weeks of negotiations on the most minute aspects of the event, including the height of podiums, the temperature of the room and allowable camera angles.]]></c>

Deputy public prosecutor Masri Mohamed Daud was quoted by Bernama as saying the large cache of weapons, if used, would have threatened national security. Zainuri was arrested in May 2001 with several others accused of engaging in militant activities and waging a "holy war" to overthrow the government after undergoing training in Afghanistan. In the same year, nine of those arrested were ordered to be held without trial under the harsh Internal Security Act.

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Prime Minister John Howard promised Friday new legislation if it was needed to fight child pornography following more than 200 arrests in a major Australia-wide crackdown on Internet pornography. The first of the 200, who included police officers, teachers, doctors and even the owner of a chain of child care centres, appeared in courts across Australia on Friday as the country's police chief signalled many more arrests were likely. Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty said more than 500 Australians could be implicated in child Internet porn, adding: "It's almost certain that there will be further arrests." Keelty said police across the country had executed more than 400 search warrants and more were to be executed on Friday following the arrest on Thursday of more than 200 men charged with around 2,000 offences. "Paedophilia is now becoming a worrying feature of law enforcement activity because it is so pervasive," he told ABC Radio. "This operation has provided us information in the order of in excess of 500 Australians accessing the material." Keelty said the operation started when US law enforcement authorities called a meeting at Interpol headquarters at Lyons in France in February, revealing the network stemming mainly from Belarus in eastern Europe. Howard, campaigning for the October 9 election in Melbourne, told a local radio station the government had introduced measures to combat Internet child pornography, but would do more if required. "The net is all-pervasive," he said. "It's worldwide. It's just a feature of our globalised society. If arising out of this there are any further legislative changes that the police recommend we'll certainly implement them." "The thing that perhaps shocks me most of all is the way in which it has spread across different sections of the community -- not that I ever have the starry-eyed idea that some particular group in the community is always free of taint and always free of wrong-doing," he said. "Anything that involves the ultimately vulnerable in our society, which are children, is something that touches everyone's heart in a big way." A 33-year-old married schoolteacher, who was among the first of the 200 suspects to face court, was charged with 22 child pornography offences on Friday. Waverley Local Court was told the teacher, whose name was suppressed, had set up a video camera behind a school change room mirror to film children changing. In Western Australia, another two teachers, one 24 and the other 46, appeared before Perth Court of Petty Sessions. One, who said he would plead guilty to two charges, was released on bail, and the other had his case adjourned for legal advice.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The dollar was narrowly mixed in Asian trade Friday after a better-than-expected Bank of Japan Tankan quarterly business confidence survey failed to spark active yen buying, dealers said. The dollar was at 110.05 yen in Tokyo afternoon trade, down slightly from 110.10 yen in New York late Thursday. The euro slipped to 1.2423 dollars from 1.2440 dollars and to 136.76 yen from 136.90 yen. "Although the Tankan survey showed an improvement, it had little impact on the yen because it was within the market's expectations," said Tetsuya Aida, dealer at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. Business confidence at large manufacturers in Japan hit a 13-year high in the three months to September, rising to 26 from 22 in June for a sixth consecutive improvement and the highest level since May 1991, when the index stood at 33. Despite the upbeat figures, Aida said investors refrained from buying the yen due to concerns that the pace of the current economic recovery appeared to be slowing. In early trade speculators tried to drive the dollar lower on the Tankan survey but met key technical support near 109.80 yen, said Kojiro Mori, senior strategist at Traders Securities. "With lingering concerns over rising oil prices -- a negative factor for the yen -- (market players) failed to drive the Japanese currency decisively higher," he said. Trading was locked in a tight range ahead of a meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in Washington later in the day, dealers said. In early afternoon trade in Singapore, the dollar fell to 9,145 Indonesian rupiah from 9,150 on Thursday, to 1,148.4 South Korean won from 1,151.9, 56.260 Philippine pesos from 56.262 and 33.922 Taiwan dollars from 33.928. The dollar rose to 1.6860 Singapore dollars from 1.6849 and to 41.415 Thai baht from 41.413.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Springsteen to mix politics and rock.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PHILADELPHIA, Pennysylvania, Sept 30 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rock star Bruce Springsteen will make a political statement during a concert for the first time in his career when he joins the "Vote for Change" tour against President George W. Bush here Friday. And the singer they call "The Boss" admits he is not entirely happy about the move. "There's some reluctance, certainly, to be coming out and doing what we're doing now," Springsteen told Knight Ridder newspapers in an interview ahead of the start of nationwide concerts in which he will appear with REM, Pearl Jam, the Dave Matthews Band, the Dixie Chicks and Sheryl Crow. Springsteen is known as a liberal but has strenuously avoided getting directly implicated in politics during 30 years of rocking audiences around the world. There have been complaints from some fans and the 55-year-old acknowledges that some will be alienated after the concerts for the Americans Coming Together group that is trying to build support for Democratic challenger John Kerry. But he believes the stakes in the November 2 election are higher than any other he has known. "This election is about a set of ideals, and truthfulness, and creating the country you want your kids to grow up in," said Springsteen. "No other election I can remember has had that kind of significance to me." He said he agreed to join the tour after talking with other musicians who were also looking for "some way to have a collective impact." "I realized that this is the time. I can't sit this one out if I meant the things I've been writing about these 30 years." The tour concentrates on 12 battleground states that are expected to play a key role in deciding the next president. While the events are political, Springsteen said there will be no hard sell speeches. "There will be no intense speechifying from the stage, as far as I know," he said. But he believes the artistic impact of his songs will be different. "The same words are going to be. changed by the moment and the event. I actually think it will add clarity to some of my music, recast some of the things I've been saying in a clearer and more powerful light." He also believes that not everyone in the sell out crowd in Philadelphia will be a Kerry supporter. "We're going to find the Republicans in the crowd, and there will be a laying on of hands. We're going to convert people." he said, adding that a lot of people he meets have not made up their mind who to vote for. Springsteen has sung about social causes ranging from racism to the September 11 attacks throughout his career. Now he is outspoken about Bush's conduct over the Iraq war. "If you mislead your people into a war, and that costs a thousand lives and many, many more wounded and 200 billion dollars of taxpayer money, and it turns out the grounds for going to war have been false, you lose your job," said the rock star. "There's an element of common sense to it." Springsteen has also expressed frustration at media coverage of Iraq. He said Kerry should make the election more of a "street fight". "Senator Kerry has to make the point that America isn't always right, but it's always true," Springsteen said. "It's as seekers of truth that our real Americanness comes to the forefront. That is a deeper sort of Americanism than the jingoism, the right-or-wrong dime-store version of the American myth the Republicans are so good at packaging. To me it's the essence of patriotism, being truthful."]]></c>

Buying in select property and telecommunications stocks which show strong earnings prospects stepped up in late trade after the key index broke through resistance level at 1,763 points, they said. The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index gained 25.68 points to close at the day's high of 1,787.25, off a low of 1,754.40. This is the best finish since April 10, 2000, when the market settled at 1,796.66. The broader all-shares index advanced 11.22 points to 1,103.85. Gainers led losers 57 to 18, with 42 stocks unchanged. Volume was 2.03 billion shares worth to 973.2 million pesos (17.3 million dollars) after 1.18 billion shares worth 1.07 billion pesos on Thursday. "More foreign funds are coming in and these will likely help sustain the market's current strength next week," said Elena Ponceca of Unicapital Securities. "I think the on-going international roadshows by the country's economic managers have helped put the Philippines back in the limelight," she said. "Stocks with strong earnings potential extended gains. some investors are also taking positions now that we are in the fourth quarter," said Ron Rodrigo of Accord Capital Equities. Top-traded SM Prime Holdings, a shopping mall operator, gained 30 centavos to 6.60 pesos. Ayala Land Inc. was up 20 centavos at 6.70 pesos. Globe Telecom rose 30 pesos to 1,120 pesos while rival Philippine Long Distance Telephone advanced 25 pesos to 1,420. Digital Telecommunications Philippines Inc gained six centavos to 96 centavos while Pilipino Telephone Corp. rose five centavos to 2.75 pesos. San Miguel Corp.'s A and B shares were unchanged at 57.50 and 70.50 pesos respectively.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[At least 20 people were killed and 35 wounded early Friday as US and Iraqi forces poured into the insurgent stronghold of Samarra, seizing the city hall and police stations, medics and the military said. The attack amounted to the first major effort by US and Iraqi forces to reclaim a rebel enclave in the Sunni Muslim triangle ahead of nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for January. "In response to repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces, Iraqi Security Forces and Multi-National Forces secured the government and police buildings in Samarra early in the morning of October 1 in support of the Iraq Interim Government and the people of Samarra," the military said. US troops and one battalion each from the Iraqi army and national guard stormed the city before dawn on Friday after a previous arrangement signed on September 9th for US forces to enter the town and patrol peacefully fell apart one week ago. The military provided no details on casualties but Dr Khalid Ahmed at Samarra's main hospital said: "We have received 20 killed and 35 wounded in the fighting." This was confirmed by Iraqi police chief in the city Colonel Mohammed Fadel Olayan. An AFP correspondent in the city said many homes were destroyed in the city's Al-Jubairiya and Al-Qadisiyah neighbourhoods as the city's streets were completely deserted. The violence flared Thursday night when US soldiers spotted three speed boats unloading explosives at 6:00 pm (1500 GMT) on the bank of the Tigris river, said Master Sergeant Rober Powell from Tikrit. A gunfight ensued and several insurgents were killed, Powell said. Insurgents in a boat then fired off mortars into the city and US forces opened fire, killing four of them at 7:09 pm (1609 GMT), he added. Loud explosions started to shake the town at 9:00 pm (1800 GMT), Samarra residents said. Within hours, US troops marched into the heart of the city, with armored vehicles rumbling down the street and AC-130 helicopter gunships roaring overhead. Sporadic clashes erupted through the early morning, Powell said. The governor of Salahuddin province, where Samarra is located, had warned on Thursday that new fighting risked plunging surrounding towns and cities into violence. "I have. warned the Americans if there is any violence in Balad and Duluiya it is because of what is happening in Samarra," said Governor Hamed Hamud al-Qaissy, referring to nearby towns. Qaissy had said Thursday that local Iraqi officials were close to brokering a deal with local leaders to allow Americans to return to Samarra. "An agreement will be announced soon. A previous signed plan with the coalition will be ready to work again, and I will tell you as soon as its finished," Qaissy said. However, the officials didn't work quickly enough to stave off a military strike.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Dodgers clinch share of division crown on dramatic homer.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Sept 30 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[David Ross smacked a two-run home run with two out in the 11th inning Thursday to give Los Angeles a 4-2 victory over Colorado that kept the Dodgers atop the National League West division by three games. The Dodgers, 92-67, matched a club record with their 52nd comeback victory of the season and set up a showdown series against San Francisco here Friday through Sunday on the final days of the Major League Baseball regular season. San Francisco, which won 4-1 Thursday at San Diego, must defeat the Dodgers all three times to force a one-game playoff Monday in San Francisco to decide the NL West division crown. The Dodgers last made the playoffs as division champions in 1996 while the Giants have won the division in each of the past two years. St. Louis and Atlanta have already clinched division titles and spots in the NL playoffs that open next week. One victory will give the Dodgers the third spot so the weekend focus shifts to a three-team fight for the wild-card berth. The Giants and Houston Astros are both 89-70 while the Chicago Cubs are 88-71 entering their final three games of the season. The Astros, who have won 15 home games in a row, appear to have the wildcard edge because they host division doormat Colorado to conclude the season while the the Cubs travel to playoff-bound Atlanta and the Giants visit the Dodgers. Ross' blast ended a Thursday thriller in which the Dodgers never led until the final swing of a bat. Jeromy Burnitz singled home Aaron Miles with two out in the 10th inning to give the Rockies a 2-1 edge but the Dodgers answered, extending the game when Jayson Werth hit into a fielder's choice to score Antonio Perez and level 2-2. Colorado grabbed the lead in the fourth inning on a run-scoring single by J.D. Closser but the Dodgers pulled even at 1-1 in the seventh inning when Shawn Green scored from third base on Alex Cora's ground out. At San Diego, Giants pitcher Jerome Williams made his return from July 30 elbow surgery a memorable one, the right-hander allowing only one run on four hits in seven inning while striking out three in San Francisco's triumph. The Padres, 86-73 after losing to San Francisco, would need to win three games against Arizona and have the Giants and Astros lose three times each to have even a hope at a wild-card berth. At Chicago, the Cubs suffered a major setback as a team that has not won a World Series crown since 1908 appeared ready to squander another chance. The Cubs fell one game behind the Giants and Astros in the wild-card chase after a 2-1 loss in 12 innings to Cincinnati. Javier Valentin's two-out double off Kyle Farnsworth in the 12th inning scored Adam Dunn with the winning run. "It's not over," Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee said. "It's obviously a lot tougher after losing, but it's not over. We just have to win the next three." Chicago lost for the fifth time in the past six games by dropping a third in a row to the Reds. "It's very frustrating. to look back and see we lost five of six to the New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds," Cubs infielder Todd Walker said. "It's very tough. For most of us, it will be difficult for the next few hours and then we will let it go."]]></c>

Xu Han Liang, 31, detonated explosives outside the house where his ex-lover Nguyen Thi Ngoc My lived with her parents in June 2002, causing extensive damage but no casualties, said the official at Ho Chi Minh City's People's Court. Xu, who had shuttled between China and Vietnam's southern business capital during their eight-year relationship, had been trying to recover the money since their break-up two years earlier. Intimidated by his actions, My returned around 3,500 dollars but Xu threatened further attacks unless she handed back the rest, prompting her to turn him in to the police. He was arrested in December that year.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Kerry scores badly needed points in debate by Peter Mackler.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democrat John Kerry stood his ground with President George W. Bush in their first televised debate, delivering a strong performance that could put him back into the election race after weeks on the ropes, analysts said. Instant polls conducted by US television networks gave a clear edge to the Massachusetts senator after a showdown Thursday with Bush on foreign policy and national security issues that was dominated by Iraq. CBS showed Kerry the winner by 44-26 percent and ABC by 45-36 percent. A CNN/Gallup poll put the margin at 53-37 percent and said 46 percent reported feeling better about the Democrat after the debate, compared to 21 percent for Bush. Analysts agreed that neither Kerry nor Bush landed any heavy blows during the 90-minute encounter at the University of Miami, the first of three presidential debates before the November 2 election. "This was the closest thing to a tie," said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. "I really was impressed. Kerry was articulate and crisp for once and Bush, I'ver never seen him so articulate." But Kerry managed to deliver his most cogent attack yet on the Iraq war and convey a sense of solidity and coherence in front of the man who has spent months ridiculing him as a weak-kneed waffler. "I think he was very effective at downplaying the argument that he had flipped and flopped on different issues," said David Corbin, a poltical science professor at the University of New Hampshire. It was not clear whether Kerry's showing would translate directly into the new support he badly needs to overcome Bush's lead in the polls, generally estimated at five to eight points. But several analysts said he now had a chance of recharging the somewhat dispirited Democratic ranks and winning back anti-Bush voters who had deserted him amid doubts about his leadership. The debate was make-or-break for Kerry, whose campaign had been reeling from relentless Republican assaults on his credibility, toughness and vaunted combat record in the Vietnam war. Both sides predictably claimed victory. The Republicans said Bush effectively highlighted the mixed signals the Democrat was sending on Iraq. They said the president made a compelling case for more time to finish the war on terror he started after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Democrats hailed their candidate for hammering away at the war in Iraq as a diversion from the real battle against Al-Qaeda terrorists and building his credentials as a smarter, more effective commander. Kerry also tried to cover confusion over his various votes in the Senate on Iraq by acknowledging that he might have flubbed some of his rhetoric, but Bush's muddled invasion was much worse. While Bush started strong in holding himself out as the best hope for keeping the United States safe, some analysts said, he appeare'Listen he's finally up there fighting.' During August you sort of got the sense he was sitting there and taking it." Siegel had no illusions that the debate itself would erase Bush's lead and propel Kerry to the front. But he added, "I think this would prevent people from closing the deal with Bush. "This leaves the matter open. It shows we are still in a presidential race and there is a lot of time before election day," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[CADARACHE, France, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[France's minister for research on Thursday expressed optimism that his country would win the battle with Japan, the United States and South Korea for the siting of a high-tech nuclear fusion research project. "Given the situation today, it's Cadarache," said Deputy Research Minister Francois d'Aubert, referring to the site proposed by France for the 10-billion-euro (12-billion-dollar) International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). If a dispute with the United States, South Korea and Japan, which proposes the Japanese site of Rokkasho-mura, is not resolved before, the European Union is expected to decide on November 25 to start construction at Cadarache, in southeastern France. "There can always be unexpected developments," said d'Aubert. "There is of course a political angle, and that could change things. But frankly. we are on the right track," he said, during a visit to Cadarache. He added that whichever of the two countries did not get the potentially lucrative site could be compensated. "There can't be a loser for ITER," he said. "If Cadarache is chosen, there can be compensations for the site that was not chosen." The EU has said it is keen to go on working within the international ITER framework, which also embraces China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. The United States and South Korea support the Japanese site, while China and Russia have backed the EU bid for the reactor to be sited at Cadarache. The project aims to build the world's first working prototype reactor for nuclear fusion, which is billed as a clean, safe, inexhaustible energy source for the future. Wrangling over the decision is expected to focus on a meeting of the six ITER partners in Vienna in mid-October, hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISLAMABAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Registration of Afghan refugees for next week's presidential polls in Afghanistan began "smoothly" in Pakistan Friday to enlist up to 800,000 voters in three days, organisers said. The International Organisation for Migration has set up around 1,670 stations to register refugees for the landmark October 9 vote. "The registration has started smoothly in the provinces of Baluchistan, NWFP (North West Frontier Province) and Islamabad," IOM spokesman Greg Bearup told AFP. "All indications are that the registration is going well." Pakistani authorities have provided tight security cover for the three-day registration process following anonymous threats against IOM staff. Taliban rebels, many of whom are believed to operate in western Pakistani border areas, have vowed to disrupt Afghanistan's first ever direct election and have conducted several attacks in recent weeks against election officials in Afghanistan. The head of the "out of country" vote, Peter Erben, said this week that election staff had received telephone threats while so-called "night letters" had circulated among the refugee community warning people not to vote. Pakistan still shelters some 1.1 million Afghans in camps, while estimates of those living in Pakistani towns and cities range from half a million to two million. Registration centers have been set up in western border areas near most of the refugee camps and in the capital Islamabad.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Taiwan share prices closed 1.7 percent higher Friday as 'old-economy' industrials and financials outperformed electronic stocks after the central bank announced a higher-than-expected hike of 25 basis points in key interest rates, dealers said. They said financials got a boost from the rate hike as it helps their margins while electronics underperformed on continuing concerns over the outlook for flat panel makers. The weighted index closed up 99.66 points at 5,945.35 on turnover of 102.53 billion Taiwan dollars (3.02 billion US dollars). Risers led decliners 494 to 185, with 135 stocks unchanged. A total of 22 stocks closed limit-up and 10 were limit-down. The transportation sector was up 5.02 percent, textiles rose 3.72 percent, plastics/petrochemicals added 3.18 percent, cement 2.88 percent, paper 2.41 percent and financials 2.15 percent while steel gained 2.07 percent. The electronics sector was up 0.81 percent. Dealers said that while old-economy companies -- cement, plastics and paper -- stil look attractive, thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panel makers remained under pressure as investors take on board concerns about oversupply and increasing competition. "Financials and old-economy industrials took center stage, while bellwether electronics, led by flat-panel companies, remained under pressure," Fubon Securities Investment Services manager Daniel Tseng said. With financials seen as beneficiaries of the central bank's rate hike, leading old-economy industrials turned firmer on expectations that these conglomerates have sufficient negotiating power to hold down funding costs despite the monetary tightening, Tseng said. He added that with the latest gains, the market is now well-positioned to test 6,000 points and beyond in the near term. Yangming Marine gained 2.10 Taiwan dollars to 32.60, Far Eastern Textile added 1.60 to 24.70 and Formosa Chemicals was up 4.00 at 62.50. All three were limit-up. Cathay Financial rose 1.50 at 65.50 and Shinkong Financial put on 1.40 at 29.10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was up 1.20 at 44.50 and United Microelectronic Corp up 0.40 at 20.90 but Chi Mei Optoelectronics lost 1.20 at 41.60 and AU Optronics shed 0.60 at 42.00.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Aborigines in 'sit-down place' see no hope of change in Australian election.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CAIRNS, Australia, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Aborigine Barry Hunter gives a dismissive shake of his dreadlocked head when asked if the Australian election will make any difference to his community in the tropics of Queensland state. "I really thought this was going to be a breakthrough election where we could help lift our people up but neither party is tackling indigenous issues," he said. "Blackfellas have been stuck out on the margins again and it doesn't look like anything's really changing." Cairns, which sits alongside the Great Barrier Reef in Australia's northeast, is a traditional "sit-down place" where Aborigines from around the region come to trade and perform ceremonies. But in modern times the ceremonies have given way to drinking and violence, which Hunter says is fuelled by an Aboriginal feeling of alienation from mainstream society that is not being addressed in the election. Australia's only indigenous senator, Democrat Aden Ridgeway, says the Aboriginal community has once again been forgotten as the country prepares to vote a week on Saturday. Ridgeway, who is facing likely defeat in the October 9 poll, accused the ruling Liberal-National coalition and the opposition Labor Party of putting Aboriginal issues in the too-hard basket. "The campaign so far has been almost devoid of any constructive mention of indigenous affairs or indigenous people," he said. Aboriginal communities remain blighted by drug abuse and alcoholism, with life expectancy 20 years below ordinary rates and indigenous people vastly over-represented among prison populations, suicide victims and the homeless. Remote outback communities are plagued by "chroming" -- petrol sniffing -- among Aboriginal youngsters, while indigenous populations in major cities suffer high crime rates and drug use. Tensions in Sydney were exacerbated in February by a riot after police were blamed for the death of an Aboriginal youth. "The health of indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islanders remains the most appalling and the worst in the world," Australian Medical Association president Bill Glasson said recently, calling for a major boost in funding for Aboriginal health care. Ridgeway says Australia's election had little relevance to the country's 400,000-strong Aboriginal community. He said the major parties had failed to make indigenous affairs a major issue in the poll, instead focusing on simpler issues such as the economy and national security. Prime Minister John Howard this year abolished Australia's main indigenous body, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Comission (ATSIC), saying it had been undermined by nepotism and corruption. Howard said the three billion dollars (2.1 billion US) a year spent on indigenous programs had been squandered on issues with lik of his government. They spend their time attacking indigenous people and indigenous leaders but fail to deliver anything substantial for indigenous people by any measurement-even by their dodgy "practical reconciliation" measure." Opposition Labor Party leader Mark Latham has agreed to the abolition of ATSIC but says an elected body is still needed for Aborigines. He has also pledged to make an apology to the stolen generation but says Aborigines must be careful to avoid the mistakes of the past.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[South Korea posted a trade surplus of 2.82 billion dollars in September, helped by brisk exports which rose 23.5 percent year-on-year, officials said Friday. Exports, on a customs-cleared basis, rose to 21.02 billion dollars in September, led by robust sales of automobiles, semiconductor chips and mobile handsets, according to the commerce, industry and energy ministry. Imports increased 25.2 percent to 18.2 billion dollars. Imports of oil increased 40.2 percent. Import growth outpaced that of exports for a second consecutive month, reflecting higher oil prices and stronger demand for capital goods, the ministry said. Exports of automobiles increased 30 percent year-on-year to 2.69 billion dollars in September. Shipments of telecommunications equipment rose 34.1 percent to 2.35 billion dollars while exports of computer equipment fell 2.2 percent to 1.38 billion dollars. In the first nine months of this year, South Korea's trade surplus jumped to 22.4 billion dollars from 8.01 billion dollars a year ago. Exports were up 35.1 percent to 185.03 billion dollars for the nine month period, while imports rose 26.2 percent to 162.63 bln usd.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[With a beer in one hand, supporters of John Kerry gathered at one of the most political bars in the United States to cheer the performance of the Democratic challenger for the White House. "Kerry was surprisingly good, very presidential," was the verdict after the 90-minute debate and all the hissing and booing at the "Hawk and Dove" bar was over. Some Republicans and undecided voters in the crowd appeared to agree. The bar's two, long wooden counters were full of people long before the debate began at 9:00pm (0100 GMT) Friday. Congressional aides mingled with lobbyists and party loyalists to follow the first, and often most important, televised presidential debate, dedicated to foreign policy. Mike Rizer, 44, a banker from North Carolina on business in the capital, was worried for his candidate Kerry. "It's gonna be a difficult one to win. Bush has done a masterful job at equating Iraq with terror, untrue but unchallenged. "I wish they were starting with the economy or issues like health care," he added. "We're crossing our fingers that he does well," said Jerome Wiley-Segovia, 30, a supporter of Howard Dean, one of Kerry's former rivals for the Democratic candidacy. "This whole week I've been worried." In the bar's subdued lighting, several oversized television screens flashed the countdown to the arrival of the two contenders for the White House at the University of Miami's Convocation Hall, in Coral Gables, Florida. "I've shown the American people I know how to lead," said Bush, as a red-haired patron raised his face from a beer glass and rolled his eyes toward the ceiling. When, a few minutes later, Kerry stated there were no links between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, the cheering and booing began. Kerry went on the offensive, calling Bush's decision to invade Iraq a "colossal error of judgement," sparking more comments. "Wow, he's going for it," said a flabberghasted young man. When Bush said he followed the tragic events in Iraq on television, a businessman shouted: "What a dumbass. You're the president, you moron." Former Republican member of the House of Representatives Bill Carney, 62, was feeling a little out of place among the predominantly Democratic patrons of the bar. "I came here to watch people's reaction to the debate. A tie would work for president Bush," he told AFP. Despite opinion polls giving Bush the edge on national security issues, after the debate Carney conceded: "Kerry certainly won from the standpoint of looking presidential." Mark Hilbert, 44, a government employee and an avowed "pure independent" who voted for consumer advocate Ralph Nader in 2000 was not planning to vote for Kerry until the debate. "Tonight was an extraordinary surpise. Usually, Kerry starts every sentence with a proposition. He didn't do that tonight, he was very declarative. "I thought Bush would just nail him. But he was on the message, very able and articulate. He did a great job."]]></c>

Police chief Da'i Bachtiar said DNA tests comparing samples found at the scene of the blast with tissue and blood from suspects' families confirmed the bomber's identity as Heri Golun. "We have a very strong conviction that this person carried the bomb and died in the explosion," Bachtiar told reporters. Police last week arrested a man carrying a letter from Golun, who lived in the Sukabumi district in the west of Indonesia's Java island, in which he sought forgiveness from his wife for carrying out the suicide bombing. A total of 16 people have so far been arrested over the embassy blast, which has been blamed on the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah regional militant group, although only five of them have been officially declared suspects. Police have named two Malaysians, Azahari Husin and Noordin Muhammad Top, as prime suspects and warned they could be planning a further attack. Azahari and Noordin are also suspected of playing major roles in the October 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people and an August 2003 bomb blast at the Marriott hotel in Jakarta. Both attacks are blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah.]]></c>

Dalman, 46, was leaving the bank "at his own request" in order to "pursue other duties," Commerzbank said in a statement. His departure, already widely anticipated, was amicable, the bank insisted. Negotiations were already underway with potential replacements. Until a permanent successor could be found, board member Klaus Patig would take over as caretaker chief of Commerzbank's investment banking operations. Earlier this week, a source had told AFP that Wolfgang Matis, head of fixed income at rival Deutsche Bank, was "in talks" to take over as head of Commerzbank's investment banking activities by the end of this year. Dalman was set to quit to set up his own hedge fund, the source said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[DAVAO, Philippines, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Four policemen were killed in an ambush laid by communist guerrillas on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao early Friday, police said. New People's Army (NPA) guerrillas ambushed the officers in the center of Baganga town, shooting two dead, provincial police chief Superintendent Catalino Cuy said. The rebels snatched two other policemen who were later found dead on the outskirts of the town a few hours after the early morning ambush, Cuy told reporters. Meanwhile, a civilian was killed and three soldiers wounded when NPA rebels ambushed a military convoy on the western island of Palawan on Wednesday, military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Lucero said in a statement. The attack occurred near the town of Taytay as the soldiers were delivering supplies to a military detachment. The lone civilian fatality had hitched a ride with one of the army trucks. Elsewhere, government troops shot dead a member of a breakaway communist guerrilla faction in a clash near the town of Arayat, north of Manila on Thursday, army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Buenaventura Pascual said. The man was a suspected member of the Revolutionary Alliance of the Children of the Sweat, an NPA offshoot, he added. The 8,600-strong NPA and its political leadership, the Communist Party of the Philippines have been waging a 35-year Maoist armed campaign. The party announced in August that it was suspending peace talks with the government because of Manila's alleged failure to persuade Western countries to remove the rebels from their lists of international terrorists.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Indonesia executes two Thais for drug trafficking (ADDS final telephone call to son).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two Thai nationals convicted for drug trafficking were executed Friday by a paramilitary firing squad despite last-minute appeals to spare their lives, an attorney general's office spokesman said. Namsong Sirilak, a 32-year-old woman, and Saelow Prasert, a 62-year-old man, were shot at 1:30 am in Medan, on Indonesia's Sumatra island, said Kemah Yahya Rachman. In August an Indian national, Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey, who was arrested in 1994 alongside the Thais for possessing 12 kilograms (26.5 pounds) of heroin, became the first person executed in Indonesia since 2001. The execution of the Thais was carried out despite an 11th-hour appeal by human rights watchdog Amnesty International to President Megawati Sukarnoputri to spare their lives. A few hours before her death, Namsong spoke by telephone with her 12-year-old son for the last time, local media reported, quoting Erliyanto Harahap, her foster father. The pair spoke in Thai for five minutes, he said. "I only know that her son asked when his mum is coming home. Then Namsong replied it's not certain because she is still busy," Harahap was quoted as saying. Namsong, a Buddhist, asked that her diary and a necklace be returned to her son, the state news agency Antara quoted Harahap as saying. She also asked that her ashes be returned to Thailand, Harahap said. Detikcom online news service said Saelow, who converted to Christianity last year, listed among his final requests a wish that he be the last person executed in Indonesia. The pair were about four meters (13 feet) apart when they were shot simultaneously, district police chief Bagus Kurniawan said, according to Detikcom. In a letter urging people to register objections with Megawati, who has rejected appeals for clemency from the Thais and eight others at imminent risk of execution, Amnesty questioned the convictions. "Amnesty International believes that their trials may not have been fair, because they did not have access to legal representation before their trial or to interpreters during the police investigation," the London-based group said. Megawati is due to leave office this month after an election defeat at the hands of her former security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Her government pledged to get tough on the growing problem of drug abuse in Indonesia. More than two dozen people, mostly foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia for drug offences. Amnesty has said at least 66 people are facing capital punishment in Indonesia. Of more than 30 people sentenced in connection with the October 2002 Bali bomb attacks in which 202 people died, three are on death row.]]></c>

Foreign ministry parliamentary spokesman Zainal Abidin Osman said the disputed ND6 and ND7 blocs were both within Malaysian waters according to a Malaysian map printed in 1978. "There is no dispute, both of the blocks fall within Malaysian territory," he said, according to the Malay-language Utusan Malaysia. He was quoted by the Malay Mail as saying Malaysia's rights are in accordance with three conventions: the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone Convention 1958, Continental Shelf Convention 1958 and the United Nations Convention on Maritime Law 1982. Malaysia's national oil company Petronas and Indonesian giant Pertamina are both reportedly planning to award exploration contracts for the two blocs, some 150 kilometres (94 miles) off Tawau in eastern Sabah state, which hold potentially significant gas and oil reserves.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[At least two school children were killed and three others seriously wounded near the Afghan border Friday when a landmine believed to have been planted by militants to target Pakistani troops exploded, residents and officials said. The children, aged between 10 and 14, were walking to school in the northwestern tribal region when they triggered the landmine hidden on the road at Sarvakai, 60 kilometers (38 miles) east of Wana, the main town in the restive South Waziristan region, resident Saifur Rehman told reporters. "The children were going to school when they picked up a landmine which was planted by militants for sabotage activity to target security forces," military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told AFP. Sultan said two of the children were killed and three seriously wounded, while Rehman said three of the children had died. Three previous explosions in the rugged region have left eight soldiers dead and more than a dozen injured. Militants allegedly linked to Al-Qaeda and Taliban fugitives have stepped up attacks on the Pakistani army, which has been engaged in operations to flush out suspected militants and their local allies in the region. The military has said around 150 foreign militants have been killed in the region over the past 12 months during which the security forces have destroyed a number of militant hideouts including several training camps. Hundreds of suspected Al-Qaeda and Taliban elements are believed to be still at large in the mountainous tribal belt which borders Afghanistan's insurgency hit south and southeastern provinces.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Japan Tankan shows business confidence higher but outlook clouded.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japanese business confidence hit 13-year highs in the September quarter, easily beating cautious forecasts and boosting local stock prices Friday, according to the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey. Confidence as measured by the large manufacturers' index rose to 26 in September from 22 in June -- the sixth consecutive quarterly improvement, the highest level since May 1991 and ahead of consensus forecasts of 23. The index of large non-manufacturers also improved to 11 from nine in the June survey. The indices compare the number of firms saying economic conditions are favourable with those saying they are unfavourable to give a net positive or negative figure. "It was better than expected, particularly among major manufacturers," said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. While the figures were a pleasant surprise, the Tankan also pointed to a slight slowdown in the coming months, apparently confirming other recent weak data on the Japanese economy, the world's second largest. For the three months to December, the Tankan forecast the large manufacturers' index would fall back to 21, with the large non-manufacturers index slipping to 10. "Basically they are saying (the future) is uncertain," Takumori said. "This uncertainty is based on an expected decline in export demand and higher procurement costs that have been brought on by rising crude oil and material prices," he said. Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at JP Morgan, said the Tankan showed domestic demand for goods and services improved in the September quarter while exports slackened. "This might be an early sign of a domestic demand-led recovery rather than (one) simply based on exports," Kanno said. Perhaps reflecting this more nuanced outcome, the reaction in the markets to the survey was mixed. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index rose 1.49 percent to close at 10,985.17 while the dollar was little changed at 110.10 yen after the figures failed to support the Japanese unit. "Although the survey showed an improvement, investors were concerned that the pace of improvement has slowed," said Hideyuki Tsukamoto, a currency dealer at Mizuho Bank. The Tankan data may begin to weigh on Japanese financial markets as investors digest the implications for future growth, said Yoshikiyo Shimamine, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life. "I wouldn't say, though, that Japan's economic growth will stall. It will only slow, dragging down stock prices and preventing interest rates from rising," he said. The sresponse in the markets, with deflation continuing and household spending slipping back. Core consumer prices, the key measure in Japan, fell 0.2 percent from a year earlier in August and were up 0.1 percent from July, while spending by salaried households was down 0.2 percent in August after a 2.9 percent rise in July. As a detailed study of Japanese businesses and their plans for the months ahead, the Tankan survey, conducted from August 24 to September 30, is the central bank's key source of data for planning its monetary policy.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ABUJA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo on Friday warned that his government will not tolerate any act of "undue militancy" in oil-rich Niger Delta or any action that would mortgage or compromise majority interest, but he recognised having talks with rebels. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," he said in a broadcast to mark the 44th anniversary of Nigeria's independence from Britain. "Government will not tolerate in any way or form any act that would mortgage or compromise the interest of the majority." He confirmed that his government was holding talks with rebel leaders from the Niger Delta and assured that a "rapprochement" was taking place. "We are talking to those I describe as rascally elements from the Niger Delta in the effort to open lines of dialogue and peace as they feel aggrieved by their state authorities," he said in a veiled reference to rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari. "The obvious assessment so far is that not much impact has been made on the lives and living standards of most ordinary people of the Niger Delta," Obasanjo said in the speech. "I appeal to those elected officials of the region whose efforts have not measured up to expectations, to endeavour to be seen to be more alive to their responsibilities and the plight of the people they are elected to govern," he said. Some officials told AFP that Obasanjo was particularly unhappy with some elected state governors in the volatile region who do not judiciously use money allocated to their states by the central federal government to provide social facilities for their people. Obasanjo appealed to residents in the region to be patient. "I want to appeal to all Nigerians that rascality and vandalism which are rapidly becoming the hallmark of the Niger Delta have implications for the production, distribution and pricing of crude oil, for our global economic rating, for investor confidence in our economy," he said. Niger Delta rebel leader Asari began talks Wednesday with officials in Obasanjo's government ahead of October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to pull out of Niger Delta, hub of Nigeria's crude production. Nigerian navy Lieutenant Commander Yakubu Agwom told AFP, meanwhile, that his forces were combing villages and creeks in the Niger Delta in search of illegal arms. "We have intensified cordon and search operations in the swamps, villages and creeks. Our efforts have paid off," Agwom said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Indonesia strides towards democracy with swearing-in of new parliament.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indonesia moved closer to full democracy Friday, swearing in legislators elected in landmark polls to a newly-reformed bicameral parliament free from military representation. In a ceremony witnessed by outgoing President Megawati Sukarnoputri, 550 members of the upper House of Representatives and a 128-strong senate-style Regional Representatives Council took oaths to serve their country. However, even before the legislators began their work, observers expressed doubts the political reforms would eradicate problems of endemic corruption, calling for tighter controls. Supreme Court chairman Bagir Manan presided over the swearing-in of the two chambers, which make up the National Consultative Assembly -- the first fully elected parliament with no military and police presence. The ceremony marks the culmination of democratic reforms which began after the resignation of military-backed dictator Suharto in 1998 and led to the country's first ever direct presidential elections last month. Previously the national assembly was made up of 500 members of the House of Representatives and 200 people standing for the regions and interest groups including the military and police. Legislators -- 70 percent of whom are new faces, including a former actor and a one-time Miss Indonesia -- pledged to work as "fairly and justly as possible" for their country. "I will struggle for the aspirations of the people and regions that I represent," they said in unison. Unlike previous elections in which people voted only for parties, this year's polls allowed voters to choose both parties and individual legislative candidates representing their areas. Indonesia's previous parliament was plagued by absenteeism, with many legislators taking advantage of five-star hotel accommodation and catering but failing to attend sessions. Under a new code of ethics approved last month, assembly members will face reprimands unless they fulfill their tasks and will be subjected to scrutiny for abuse of power and corruption. But Bambang Widjojanto of the Partnership for Governance Reform said new measures did not go far enough and greater controls, including a "caucus" of self-regulation, were needed to keep lawmakers in check. "A caucus of legislators that is designed to keep its members from corruption is urgent given the fact that corruption, collusion and nepotism are rampant," Bambang told the Jakarta Post. In another historic vote on September 20, Indonesians elected to replace Megawati with ex-general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who has pledged to fight the graft which has hampered economic growth when he takes office on October 20. Yudhoyono, who heads the minority Democrat Party, will however face a struggle to implement promises of reform in the parliament, which is dominated by a coalition which backed Megawati in the presidential polls. And while the once-powerful military's political role has been sidelined, a controversial bill was approved in the final hours of the outgoing parliament that redefined its post-Suharto role but gave concessions to top commanders. The new law gives the army an ambiguous mandate to maintain a territorial presence in "strategic" locations. While it also prohibits armed forces leaders from entering politics, it allows them to hold senior civilian positions.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Australian share prices closed 0.15 percent lower Friday, snapping their latest record breaking run on a weaker News Corp. as investors opted to take profits, dealers said. They said News Corp., which earns the majority of its income in the United States, was hit by nervousness ahead of the weekend G7 meeting where exchange rates and oil will be key topics. The downside was limited by gains in the banks as attention turns to up-coming results while future earnings prospects remain positive because of a relatively benign interest rate environment. The benchmark SP/ASX 200 index fell 5.4 points to 3,659.6 while the broader All Ordinaries index closed down 5.7 points at 3,669.0. Turnover totalled 944.3 million shares worth 2.4 billion dollars (1.72 billion US) as gains led losers 698 to 631, with 371 stocks steady. CommSec chief economist Craig James said the Australian share market is experiencing its strongest upturn for a decade and appears well set for further gains as valuations remain reasonable despite the recent record advance. "In short, the current share market upturn has further to go," James said. He said the market seems to be paying little attention to the upcoming October 9 federal elections. "So far, the federal election campaign has merely proved to be a blip on financial market radar screens." Dealers said gold stocks proved a feature, ending higher after gold prices hit five-and-a-half month highs on the latest US dollar weakness The same factor helped the resources sector generally, with nickel up almost 11 percent to be just short of the 14-year high struck in January while copper and aluminum prices hit five month highs. News Corp. ordinary shares fell 13 cents to 11.28 dollars while its preference shares fell 16 cents to 10.72. National Australia bank rose six cents to 27.04 dollars, Commonwealth Bank was up 31 cents at 30.50, ANZ gained 18 cents to 19.20 and Westpac rose eight cents to 17.81. Rio Tinto gained 38 cents to 38.35 dollars while BHP Billiton fell 8 cents to 14.28 dollars after reaching record highs during the week. Leading gold stock Newcrest rose 34 cents to 5.53 dollars and Lihir Gold was up six cents at 1.13. Telstra slipped one cent to 4.64 dollars. Qantas was down three cents at 3.42 dollars and Virgin Blue dropped three cent to 1.74.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The opposition Labor Party promised Friday to renew Australia's emphasis on engagement with Asia while continuing to support a strong alliance with the United States if it wins the October 9 election. In a foreign policy statement, shadow foreign minister Kevin Rudd also promised a Labor government would work with its neighbours to develop a regional counter-terrorism strategy based on principles of "cooperation and not pre-emption." Prime Minister John Howard's conservative government had embraced a new doctrine of regional military pre-emption and "even worse, advanced the extraordinary argument that it is valid for foreign governments to launch pre-emptive military strikes on Australian soil," Rudd said. Labor also promised financial help to neigbouring countries to fight the war on terror, including 12.5 million dollars (9.0 million US) over two years to enhance the counter terrorism capabilities of the Indonesian police. In an effort to counter "the underlying political, economic and societal factors exploited by terrorist organisations", it commited another 25 million dollars over two years to supporting Indonesia's efforts to strengthen its mainstream education system. The alternatives -- religious madrassas -- are blamed for fomenting the Islamic radicalism that fuels terrorism. Labor would also counter a major source of terrorist financing by providing 22.5 million dollars over two years for a range of counter-narcotics initiatives in Afghanistan. "The key foreign and national security policy question for Australians at this election is whether the Howard Government has made Australia more or less secure," Rudd said in a statement. "The answer is clear. After eight years of Howard Government foreign policy, Australia has become less secure in our region and the wider world. "Labors Foreign Policy Statement offers a comprehensive plan to enhance Australias security in our region, enhance our national economic prosperity and restore Australias voice and influence in global affairs." Labors foreign policy strategy, he said, is based on three fundamental pillars: support for a continuing strong alliance with the US, an abiding commitment to the United Nations and "comprehensive engagement with our friends and partners in our own region."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Jakarta was Friday preparing a crisis team to try to secure the release of two Indonesian women seized by Islamic militants in Iraq but said it had made no decision on whether it would negotiate with kidnappers. The capture of the women, who were pictured wearing Islamic headscarves in a video shot by the militants and aired on Arabic television, has caused surprise and consternation in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-populated country. Foreign ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa said Rosidah binti Anom and Rafikan binti Amin, who were working for a British company, had been captured by a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq. The group, which appears to be an offshoot of another group which has been holding two French journalists since August 20, has not made any ransom or political demands to Indonesia, he said. "There is a possibility for a ransom. we will not foreclose such possibilities and we will make a decision when that demand is made," he told a press conference. The women, employed by British electronics company G-Bell, were being held "most likely" because of their employer and not because of Indonesia's political stance or role in the Iraq conflict, Natalegawa said. "We do not have troops in Iraq and our political position on Iraq has been known for some time in expressing our concerns about developments there and in denouncing and condemning the aggression against Iraq," he said. "The government of Indonesia is deeply concerned with this development. We would expect the hostage takers to release our nationals immediately. "They have absolutely no relevance or relations whatsoever with political matters. They are there as Indonesians making an honest living in Iraq," he said, adding that the capacity of the women's status in the firm was unknown. The Indonesian women were captured alongside six Iraqis and two Lebanese working for an electrical equipment firm, Al-Jazeera television said. Four of the presumed captives, all men, were shown in the video, with the captors pointing machine-guns at them. The channel later aired more footage showing the two women. Many of the insurgents fighting US-led forces who have taken foreigners hostage in Iraq in the past few months have demanded that their employers stop operating in the country. Ransoms were paid in some cases to secure releases. Natalegawa said the government was trying to locate relatives of the women to ask them to "make a public appeal to the hostage takers so that they (the women) be released immediately." Indonesia's manpower minister, Jacob Nuwa Wea, said the women had apparently sought work in Iraq without government consent. "We have forbidden our workers from working there because it's difficult for us to give them protection," he said. In August engineer Fahmi Ahmad, 27, became the first Indonesian killed in Iraq since the start last year of the US-led invasion. He was attacked in the northern town of Mosul while working for a London-based contractor. Natalegawa said then that only 13 Indonesians were known to be still in Iraq, including eight students and two embassy employees married to Iraqis.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japanese share prices closed 1.49 percent higher Friday after the key Tankan survey showed continued improvement in business sentiment in the September quarter, dealers said. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index gained 161.60 points to 10,985.17. The broader TOPIX index of all First Section shares rose 15.18 points or 1.38 percent to 1,117.29. Advancers led decliners 1,209 to 284, with 84 stocks unchanged on brisk volume of 1.46 billion shares, up from 1.30 billion on Thursday. "The rebound from recent declines, which started Thursday, is continuing, encouraged by the Tankan survey," said Masatoshi Sato, strategist at Mizuho Investors Securities. Just before trading began, the Bank of Japan's Tankan showed that sentiment improved widely over the past quarter, with both corporate spending and profits for the year to March 2005 now expected to rise even more strongly than forecast in June. However, the survey also showed that the improvement in business sentiment is expected to slow substantially over at least the next three months. Share prices rose virtually across the board, with the biggest gains among domestic demand-oriented companies such as the banks, real-estate developers, contractors, drug makers and food and beverage companies. In the banking sector, Mizuho Financial Group rose 18,000 or 4.4 percent to 432,000, with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group up 26,000 or 4.1 percent at 656,000. Sumitomo Metal Industries rose four or 3.1 percent to 135 and Kobe Steel increased four or 2.5 percent to 164. Takeda Pharmaceutical, the largest drugs company in Japan, rose 100 or 2.0 percent to 5,100. Among major contractors, Taisei rose eight yen or 2.3 percent to 358 yen and Shimizu gained 10 or 2.3 percent to 448.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Thailand launched its month-long war on bird flu Friday with more than 900,000 volunteers carrying out house-to-house checks for signs of the disease, a senior health official said. Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has announced a goal of eradicating the disease from Thailand by October 31 and thousands scoured outlying villages and poor areas of Bangkok for sick birds and humans. Thailand earlier this week confirmed its first probable case of human-to-human infection of bird flu following the deaths of a mother and daughter. At least 10 people have died in Thailand and 19 in Vietnam from bird flu during two waves of outbreaks this year that have killed millions of birds from across the region. The two confirmed and two suspected cases within a single Thai family in the last week raised concerns that the disease had mutated into a more contagious and lethal form that could trigger a what you would like to see is being done here," said Scott Dowell, of the US Centers for Disease Control, which is examining samples from the Thai family outbreak. "There's careful surveillance all around the original family cluster and they've identified areas where chickens are sick and dying and culled all of the poultry." Bird flu has struck 32 of Thailand's 76 provinces since July in the second wave of cases this year and badly hit poultry sales overseas. Thailand had been one of the world's biggest exporters before the bird flu crisis.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Nigerian troops are combing villages and creeks in the troubled oil-rich Niger Delta in search of illegal arms, a spokesman said Friday. "We have intensified cordon and search operations in the swamps, villages and creeks. Our efforts have paid off," navy Lieutenant Commander Yakubu Agwom told AFP by telephone from his base in Buguma, west of Port Harcourt, the hub of Nigeria's vast oil resources. Buguma is the home town of rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari, who is fighting for a share of Nigeria's oil wealth and who arrived in the capital Abuja Wednesday for peace talks with government officials. Agwon said security men raided a village near Buguma early this week and found some weapons. "A cache of arms and ammunitions such as AK-47 rifles were found in the village. Although the villagers claimed the weapons were for self-defence against attack by armed gangs terrorising them, they cooperated with security agents by surrendering them," he said. He said ethnic militia and cult gangs such as Dey Gbam, Greenlanders, Egbesu Boys, Bush Boys, Icelanders, Elegamface and Okrika Boys were stockpiling arms to fight for supremacy in the region. The armed struggle is financed by illegal bunkering -- stealing of crude oil from illegally-tapped pipelines before selling it to unscrupulous local and foreign buyers. Officials say Nigeria loses some 50,000 barrels of oil daily to smugglers and sea pirates operating in the hundreds of creeks and swamps dotting the Niger delta. Some 500 people have died in gang violence in the past month in Port Harcourt and its surrounding creeks, according to Amnesty International, but the government said only 13 were killed. Asari's Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), which late Monday threatened oil installations and asked foreign oil workers to quit the region, is one of the militias fighting for supremacy over control of the west African country's illegal oil trafficking in the area. The group claims to be fighting for the rights of the ethnic Ijaws living around the centre of Nigeria's oil industry, which turns out about 2.3 million barrels per day. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, derives more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange revenue from oil extracted from the Delta region. The unrest in Nigeria has sent jitters to the international oil market where a barrel is hovering around 50 dollars. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned Friday that his government would not tolerate any act of "undue militancy" in the Niger Delta. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," he said in a broadcast to mark the 44th anniversary of Nigeria's independence from Britain. "Government will not tolerate in any way or form any act that would mortgage or compromise the interest of the majority."]]></c>

The NZSX50 gross index was up 19.32 points to 2,853.72 on turnover of 175.1 million New Zealand dollars (118.8 million US dollars). Dealers said local investors were using funds raised by selling off their Powerco shares to their foreign counterparts to buy into high yielding stocks. Powerco closed unchanged at 2.10 dollars, coming off a low of 2.06 dollars as the stock accounted for some 71 million dollars of the day's trade. Prime Infrastructure has offered 2.15 dollars a share for the company and more than 40 percent of Powerco has changed hands this week, dealers said. Hamilton Hindin Greene broker Grant Williamson said the "messy" trade in Powerco shares had positive implications for the market generally. "What we are seeing is a lift in some of the good quality stocks as reinvestment of the Powerco proceeds occurs," he said. "The market is chasing the yield stocks to replace the good yield Powerco used to provide."

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair was admitted to hospital on Friday for minor surgery to treat an irregular heartbeat, London police said. The operation, which involves only a local anaesthetic and is described as routine, is expected to last around two and a half hours, after which Blair, who is 51, will remain in the hospital until Saturday morning and then rest over the weekend. Blair's doctor Punit Ramrakha said on Thursday that "due to a recurrence of the irregular heartbeat, we have arranged to admit him to hospital to have a procedure known as catheter ablation." Professor John Camm, a professor of cardiology with the British Heart Foundation, added that the surgery should stop the problem returning in the future. "This is a really simple technique," he said. "A wire is placed inside the cavity of the heart having been put in through a vein, in the top of the leg usually. "The wire is guided through the abdomen, into the chest and into the heart using an X-ray machine," Camm said. Blair is to spend Friday night in the hospital and rest over the weekend before returning to "normal duties" on Monday and continuing with a visit to Africa on Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesman said. Also on Thursday, Blair said in radio interviews that the surgery was "not particularly alarming but it's something that you should get fixed. It's a routine procedure." "I've had (the condition) for the last couple of months and it's not impeded me from doing my work and (I'm) feeling fine, but it's as well to get it done," a ruddy-faced Blair, wearing a suit and tie, said in an interview with the BBC. Blair told his interviewers that despite the heart procedure, he would still seek a third term and, if elected, serve it in full.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The opposition Labor Party promised Friday to renew Australia's emphasis on engagement with Asia while continuing to support a strong alliance with the United States if it wins the October 9 election. In a foreign policy statement, shadow foreign minister Kevin Rudd also promised a Labor government would work with its neighbours to develop a regional counter-terrorism strategy based on principles of "cooperation and not pre-emption." Prime Minister John Howard's conservative government had embraced a new doctrine of regional military pre-emption and "even worse, advanced the extraordinary argument that it is valid for foreign governments to launch pre-emptive military strikes on Australian soil," Rudd said. Labor also promised financial help to neighbouring countries to fight the war on terror, including 12.5 million dollars (9.0 million US) over two years to enhance the counter terrorism capabilities of the Indonesian police. In an effort to counter "the underlying political, economic and societal factors exploited by terrorist organisations", it committed another 25 million dollars over two years to supporting Indonesia's efforts to strengthen its mainstream education system. The alternatives -- religious madrassas -- are blamed for fomenting the Islamic radicalism that fuels terrorism. Labor would also counter a major source of terrorist financing by providing 22.5 million dollars over two years for a range of counter-narcotics initiatives in Afghanistan. "The key foreign and national security policy question for Australians at this election is whether the Howard government has made Australia more or less secure," Rudd said in a statement. "The answer is clear. After eight years of Howard Government foreign policy, Australia has become less secure in our region and the wider world. He accused the government of taking Australia to war in Iraq on the basis of exaggerations, distortions and half-truths, in defiance of the UN Security Council and in spite of advice it would increase rather than diminish the terrorist threat to Australia. Australia's involvement in the Iraq conflict and Labor's pledge to withdraw its troops by Christmas if it wins office are a key issue in the election, with the latest polls showing Labor ahead. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer responded by saying Australia had already put into place agreements on counter terrorism with nine regional countries and had jointly hosted a regional counter terrorism summit with Indonesia. "Labor's policy simply endorses this regional leadership and cooperation that is already underway," he said. Rudd said Labors foreign policy strategy was based on three fundamental pillars: support for a strong alliance with the US, an abiding commitment to the United Nations and "comprehensive engagement with our friends and partners in our own region." Labor also promised to provide 75 million dollars over two years to Iraq to strengthen its health care and border security systems and contribute 20-30 non-combatant personnel to support the UN protection force in Iraq. It promised to develop a bilateral engagement strategy with China, to do more to realise the "enormous untapped potential of Australia's relations with India" and to work with regional partners to revitalise the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group and restore its trade liberalisation role.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Some 100 teams are expected to take part in the first-ever car rally from India through South East Asia next month, an Indian state minister said Friday. India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will flag off the 8,000-kilometer (4,950-mile) rally in Guwahati, the main city of the eastern state of Assam, November 22. From there, motorists will drive through the 10-nation Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic zone made up of Myanmar, Thailand, Brunei, Philippines, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore, winding up in Batam, Indonesia, December 11. The rally -- the first of its kind -- "will open up the doors for stronger economic ties" between India and ASEAN nations, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi told AFP. The rally is aimed at highlighting that a land route exists between India and ASEAN countries in a bid to spur trade. The event, costing eight million dollars, is being organised by India's foreign ministry and leading industry body, the Confederation of Indian Industry. "The whole idea is about networking the region on wheels," said Gogoi, adding the exact itinerary and other details were still being worked out. The event was the brainchild of former Indian prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who called at an ASEAN summit in October 2003 for a car rally to "foster regional unity." Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party government was ousted at the polls in May by the left-backed Congress party.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW DELHI, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Newly-elected Indian cricket board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra has barely been in office a day, but his credentials are already under intense scrutiny. The lawyer defeated political heavyweight Sharad Pawar 16-15 in an acrimonious election for the top post of India's richest sports body in Calcutta on Wednesday, courtesy of a casting vote by outgoing chief Jagmohan Dalmiya. Indian newspapers questioned whether Mahendra would be his own man or just a pawn in the hands of the most powerful and controversial figure in Indian cricket, Dalmiya. Mahendra, 60, is not new to cricket politics as he has held various board posts, including secretary, but was never considered a please-all administrator. Among his bitter critics are current India captain Sourav Ganguly and legendary former skipper Kapil Dev. "He (Mahendra) is probably the worst guy I've ever seen in my life," the Delhi-based Times of India on Friday quoted Ganguly as saying in an interview in 2000. Ganguly was referring to his experiences on the 1991-92 tour of Australia, where Mahendra was an administrator manager. Ganguly accused the manager of deliberately spreading misinformation about him. "It's a shame that we have had managers like him for India on long tours. He was a shame to Indian cricket," said Ganguly, who was then accused of having "attitude problems". Ganguly figured in just a one-dayer on that tour and had to wait for nearly five years before making his Test debut in England. Mahendra was at his diplomatic best when asked after his election to comment on Ganguly's past remarks. "I'll meet the captain and the team. They've a challenging series against Australia coming up and I'll wish them good luck," he responded. Kapil was closely associated with the new cricket chief, having represented the same state of Haryana in national tournaments for over a decade. But the national hero was hardly impressed, even raising a banner of revolt against Mahendra's style of functioning in the late 1990s. However it was Kapil who quit the game while Mahendra continued to reign supreme in the state. "The media may project him as a quiet person, but there is also a cunning side to Mahendra," Kapil told the Times. "I've no time for him because he has no time for cricket. I dislike him and his style of functioning. Again we've a president who has not played cricket." Mahendra, however, also has his admirers. Former India wicket-keeper Vijay Yadav praised his administrative skills. "He is a man who is balanced in his approach and gives due credit to players and officials," said Yadav. Mahendra faces a tough task even before he has started his new innings. He must resolve the ongoing row over telecast rights for upcoming home Test series against Australia and South Africa. "I've been associated with the board for 30 years. As soon as I take over as the president, you'll see how I work," he said. Technically, his appointment has to be approved by the board's general meeting which has been adjourned until October 26. His rival's supporters are threatening to contest the election in a court.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BEIRUT, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Lebanese minister who resigned recently in a dispute over Syria's domination of the country, was wounded Friday when his car was targeted by a bomb in Beirut, a source at the American University of Beirut hospital said. Outgoing Economy and Trade Minister Marwan Hamadeh's driver was killed and his bodyguard wounded in the blast, which occurred on the Mediterranean seafront of the Lebanese capital. Hamadeh was "lightly wounded in the face and hands following the explosion of a bomb placed under his car," the hospital source said. The dead driver was identified as Ghazi Bou Karoum, while the unnamed bodyguard was said not to have life-threatening injuries. Hamadeh is one of four ministers who quit on September 6 in protest at a controversial Syrian-inspired constitutional amendment that kept Damascus protege President Emile Lahoud in power for another three years. He and two of the others belong to the secular leftist faction of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. On September 1, Lebanese MPs bowed to Syrian pressure to change the constitution to allow Lahoud to remain in office beyond his original six-year term. That move came despite a UN Security Council resolution adopted a day earlier backing Lebanon's sovereignty and implicitly censuring Damascus by demanding that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Lebanon. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to report to the Security Council Friday on any steps taken to implement Resolution 1559. On Wednesday, Syria wrapped up a limited troop pullout, with about 3,000 soldiers have returned home from their posts on the southern outskirts of Beirut. The pullout leaves about 15,000 Syrian troops on Lebanese soil, down from a peak of between 35,000 and 40,000 during the Lebanese civil war, but fails to meet UN demands for a complete withdrawal. Syria, already under US sanctions for allegedly supporting terrorism, has faced intense international pressure to end its political and military domination of Lebanon.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Malaysia's opposition Islamic Party (PAS), which frowns upon rock concerts, will stage an all-male Islamic alternative event this weekend in a new attempt to woo Muslim youths, a report said Friday. The "Alternative Entertainment Night" organised by the PAS youth wing, at its headquarters in a Kuala Lumpur suburb Saturday will only feature male performers including popular rockers from the local Blues Gang and rock musician-turned-preacher Mohamad Akil Hayy. "It may not turn out to be a crowd puller but the objective is to prevent Muslim youths from being exposed to social ills," youth chief Salahuddin Ayob told the New Straits Times. PAS, which aims to turn multicultural Malaysia into a theocratic state under Islamic rule, often slams western rock concerts as "immoral and un-Islamic" and last month protested at a concert by German rock band Scorpions. Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia president Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman said providing alternative entertainment would constructively discourage Muslim youths from attending rock concerts. "Islam has been potrayed as a religion which seems to forbid everything. We have to show that entertainment is allowed," he said. The party is seeking to revive its support base after it was thumped by the ruling coalition in general elections in March when it also lost power in one of two states that it ruled.]]></c>

President Ludwig Scotty's action late Thursday, when he also declared a state of emergency, followed a stalemate in parliament that prevented a reform budget drafted with Australian assistance from being passed on deadline. Nauruans will vote in the presidential and parliamentary poll on October 23 -- their second election in 18 months. Speaker Russell Kun told Australian Associated Press that he and some opposition MPs would go to the Supreme Court in an attempt to block Scotty's move. Scotty's declaration is the latest twist in a long-running saga for Nauru, once the second wealthiest nation in the world per capita because of royalties from phosphate mining. But once the phosphate was mined out the island became a wasteland, its investments lost to mismanagement. Australia, which for the last three years has held asylum seekers in a detention centre on the island under an agreement with its government, has sent 30 million dollars (21.6 million US) of dollars in aid to Nauru recently. But the island faces a financial crisis after failing to maintain repayments on a 230 million dollar loan (165 million US) from the US company GE Capital, and its multi-million dollar portfolio of assets is now in receivership in Australia. Three officials from Australia's foreign affairs department and treasury have been on the island since July helping with economic management. Nauru faced another constitutional crisis earlier this year when former president Rene Harris was removed in a vote of no-confidence by parliament while he was out of the country. The crisis was sparked by the suspension from parliament last month of health minister Kieren Keke, the nation's leading reform MP. Speaker Russell Kun suspended Keke after complaints that his dual Nauru-Australian citizenship made him ineligible to be an MP. Despite legal advice from Chief Justice Barry Connell that Keke remained a member of parliament, Kun declared him a stranger when he attended parliament on Thursday and refused to allow business to proceed. With the 18-member parliament locked at eight votes all, the budget lapsed at midnight. In his televised address on Thursday, Scotty said he had no choice but to take the action he had. Kun, a close ally of Harris, said the president's action was unconstitutional. "There's anarchy going on around here," said Kun. "There's orders given to police that I vacate my office. I'm packing while I'm talking to you. "It's incredible. (Nauru) has been singlehandedly taken over by one person. Whatever happened to the separation of powers." Kun said there was no justification to declare a state of emergency, which should only apply when the nation's security or economy was threatened.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Turkey will decide Friday the fate of a planned meeting in Istanbul between the European Union and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which the EU has threatened to boycott if the hosts insist on calling breakaway Turkish Cypriots a "state," a diplomat here said. "We are expecting today the final decision on whether the meeting will be held or cancelled. The meeting is in doubt at the moment," the diplomat told AFP on the condition of anonymity. "Maybe we could go ahead only with OIC members," he added. The row stems from a decision by the OIC in June to refer to the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as "the Cypriot Turkish state," without officially recognizing it. The Turkish Cypriots, whose breakaway statelet is recognized only by Ankara, have observer status at the OIC. A source close to the Dutch presidency of the EU said late Thursday that Dutch leaders would not attend the talks and had also asked the 25 EU member states to stay away. Turkey has turned down one EU proposal to solve the problem under which representatives of observer nations would sit at the table without name plaques, EU officials said. The Istanbul gathering, scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, was intended to promote better ties and understanding between Europe and Muslim countries.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two Thai nationals convicted for drug trafficking were executed Friday by a paramilitary firing squad despite last-minute appeals to spare their lives, an attorney general's office spokesman said. Namsong Sirilak, a 32-year-old woman, and Saelow Prasert, a 62-year-old man, were shot at 1:30 am in Medan, on Indonesia's Sumatra island, said Kemah Yahya Rachman. The European Union expressed dismay and regret at their deaths. In August an Indian national, Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey, who was arrested in 1994 alongside the Thais for possessing 12 kilograms (26.5 pounds) of heroin, became the first person executed in Indonesia since 2001. The execution of the Thais came despite an 11th-hour appeal by human rights watchdog Amnesty International to President Megawati Sukarnoputri to spare their lives. A few hours before her death, Namsong spoke by telephone with her 12-year-old son for the last time, local media reported, quoting Erliyanto Harahap, her foster father. The pair spoke in Thai for five minutes, he said. "I only know that her son asked when his mum is coming home. Then Namsong replied it's not certain because she is still busy," Harahap was quoted as saying. Namsong, a Buddhist, asked that her diary and a necklace be returned to her son, the state news agency Antara quoted Harahap as saying. She also asked that her ashes be returned to Thailand, Harahap said. Detikcom online news service said Saelow, who converted to Christianity last year, listed among his final requests a wish that he be the last person executed in Indonesia. The pair were about four meters (13 feet) apart when they were shot simultaneously, district police chief Bagus Kurniawan said, according to Detikcom. In a letter urging people to register objections with Megawati, who has rejected appeals for clemency from the Thais and eight others at imminent risk of execution, Amnesty questioned the convictions. "Amnesty International believes that their trials may not have been fair, because they did not have access to legal representation before their trial or to interpreters during the police investigation," the London-based group said. Megawati is due to leave office this month after an election defeat to her former security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Her government pledged to get tough on the growing problem of drug abuse in Indonesia. Through the Dutch embassy in Jakarta, the European Union said in a statement that it had "learned with dismay" about the latest executions. "The EU would like to express its regret on the executions in Medan," the statement said, expressing hope Indonesian newly-elected government will reinstall a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. More than two dozen people, mostly foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia for drug offences. Amnesty has said at least 66 people are facing capital punishment in Indonesia. Of more than 30 people sentenced in connection with the October 2002 Bali bomb attacks in which 202 people died, three are on death row.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A senior French foreign ministry official arrived here early Saturday as part of efforts to secure the release of two French hostages in Iraq, the French ambassador announced. Jean-Pierre Lafon, the ministry's secretary general, arrived in the Jordanian capital at 2:30 am (2330 GMT Thursday), Ambassador Jean Michel Caza said. He will "work on the fate of the hostages," Caza said, without providing details. "He is here, he is working and we do not know how long he will be here." The foreign ministry said in a statment earlier that, Foreign Minister Michel Barnier had sent Lafon to Amman "as part of ongoing efforts to secure the release of the hostages." That came as a French lawmaker expressed optimism about the release of the two hostages as he began a trip to the Middle East Thursday to help secure their freedom. "I never promised anything without being sure of being able to deliver. or else why do you think I bothered." Didier Julia told an AFP correspondent who arrived on the same flight from Paris to Beirut. Julia aides in Damascus said the two journalists -- Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France -- were in "safe hands" but that their release depended on the security situation around the rebel-held town of Fallujah, west of Baghdad.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The chairman of the French National Assembly Jean-Louis Debre on Friday added his voice to those expressing scepticism about the self-declared mission of lawmaker Didier Julia to secure the release of two hostages in Iraq. Asked on state television what he thought of Julia's initiative, Debre said: "Sometimes I prefer not to think. (Julia) is acting purely in his own name, and certainly not in that of the National Assembly or of France." On Thursday President Jacques Chirac's office denied a claim by an associate of Julia that the mission had been sanctioned by the Elysee Palace, and a defence ministry spokesman said it was creating "more confusion than certainty." Julia, a 70 year-old member of Chirac's UMP party with close ties to Iraq, flew to Damascus Thursday in order to "explore new avenues" for extricating journalists Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot who have been held for six weeks by the Islamic Army in Iraq. On Wednesday another of Julia's associates, former paratrooper Philippe Brett, said he had met the two journalists in captivity and that their liberation was a matter of time.

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indonesian police on Friday announced a breakthough in the hunt for militants behind last month's attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta, naming the suicide bomber who delivered the deadly blast. Police chief Da'i Bachtiar said DNA tests comparing samples found at the scene of the blast with tissue and blood from suspects' families confirmed the bomber's identity as Heri Kurniawan, alias Golun. "We have a very strong conviction that this person carried the bomb and died in the explosion," Bachtiar told reporters. Nine other people were killed and more than 180 were injured in the September 9 attack, which has been blamed in the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group. Bachtiar said tests were being carried out on two further samples to determine if there were any other suicide bombers involved. Police last week arrested a man carrying a letter from Kurniawan, who lived in the Sukabumi district in the west of Indonesia's Java island, in which he sought forgiveness from his wife and parents for the bombing. Indonesia's chief detective Suyitno Landung, who is leading the hunt for the bombing masterminds, said the letter appealed to Kurniawan's then-pregnant wife to name their son Rahmad Jundullah, or soldier of God. "Basically the letter contains apologies and asks for permission to die as a martyr," Landung said. A photograph of Kurniawan taken in December 2003 was released by police, who displayed a copy of his marriage certificate showing he was wed last year. A total of 16 people have so far been arrested over the embassy blast, although only five of them have been officially declared suspects. Bachtiar said some of those in custody had claimed they belonged to an organisation known as the Islamic State of Indonesia, a largely ideological group with no established links to extremist violence. Police have named two Malaysians Azahari Husin and Noordin Muhammad Top, as prime suspects in the embassy attacks and warned they could be planning further strikes. Azahari and Noordin are also suspected of playing major roles in the October 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people and an August 2003 bomb blast at the Marriott hotel in Jakarta. Both attacks are blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah. More than than 200,000 leaflets bearing the pictures of nine men wanted for terrorism including the embassy blast have been distributed by police, including the Malaysians and another key suspect Rois, alias Iwan Darmawan.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISLAMABAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Afghanistan's ousted Taliban regime Friday urged the country's people to reject next week's presidential election which it said was a ploy to justify US occupation. "These are not independent and just elections, neither do they reflect the will of the people of Afghanistan," said a statement issued by Taliban spokesman Hamid Agha in the northwestern Pakistani city Peshawar near to the Afghan border. The statement came as the International Organisation of Migration (IOM) started registration of refugees in Pakistan for "out of country" voting in the October 9 presidential polls. "The Muslim people of Afghanistan know that the so called elections are in fact a foreign project to justify the US forces occupation," the statement in Pashtu language said. "This procedure will only protect the interests of foreigners. This procedure is an outcome of an oppressive wish of America," said the statement circulated by the private Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press agency. "The winner and the system have already been decided. We appeal to the people of Afghanistan and particularly the refugees not to support or participate in the procedure for the sake of their national honour and faith." Taliban rebels have intensified attacks in recent weeks inside Afghanistan particularly in the south and southeastern parts of the country bordering Pakistan, in a bid to disrupt the first ever direct elections. An expected ten percent of the votes are likely to come from more than a million refugees living in Pakistan and Iran. The IOM, which started registering up to 800,000 Afghan voters in Pakistan Friday, has received anonymous threats in recent days over the enlistment.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The US military said 94 insurgents were killed on Friday as its troops and Iraqi forces thrust into Samarra town in a first effort to reclaim troublespots before Iraq's planned elections, while a shocked nation buried 34 children killed by car bombs. In the United States, President George W. Bush and challenger John Kerry held their first pre-election debate before the November 2 ballot, with Kerry terming the invasion of Iraq "a colossal error" and Bush reiterating "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein." Some instant polls straight after said Kerry had beaten the president. A Gallup poll for CNN gave Kerry a 46 percent to 37 percent win over Bush. Iraq's hostage saga showed no let-up, with Jakarta confirming on Friday that two Indonesian women were among the 10 latest people to be kidnapped. Al-Jazeera television said the two were seized alongside six Iraqis and two Lebanese working for an electrical equipment firm. In the aftermath of Thursday car bombings in which the 34 children died, the group of suspected Al-Qaeda operative Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi claimed, via its website, responsibility for three suicide bombings in Iraq. The authenticity of the claim on www.ansarnet.ws/vb/ could not be verified. The Samarra operation, 125 kilometres (80 miles) north of Baghdad, started before dawn, with the US military saying its forces had seized the city hall and police stations. The offensive followed vows by the interim government to win back swathes of lawless territory in the Sunni Muslim triangle before November to prepare for the January poll. "In response to repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces (US military terminology for insurgents), Iraqi Security Forces and Multi-National Forces secured the government and police buildings in Samarra. on October 1," the military said. A US military spokesman said 94 insurgents had been killed and one wounded. He gave no details of any casualties on the US-led coalition side. The figure for the wounded contrasted with an earlier statement from a doctor in the town. Dr Khaled Ahmed at Samarra's main hospital said: "We have received 20 killed and 35 wounded in the fighting." At least three US soldiers were wounded in the fighting and five insurgents were detained, a military spokesman said. The governor of Salaheddin province, where Samarra is located, cautioned on Thursday that fresh fighting risked plunging surrounding towns into violence. Unaware of the impending battle, Governor Hamed Hamud al-Qaissy told AFP that local Iraqi officials were close to brokering a deal to allow Americans to return to the troublespot. But the government of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, a former Baathist with ties to the US intelligence agency, the CIA, opted for military force. In a harbinger of the Samarra onslaught, Depbodies of children from the rubble as the twin bombs exploded in succession just two days before the start of the new school year, with questions abounding about security. At Baghdad's Yarmuk hospital doctors said they received 41 bodies. The US military said 10 US soldiers were also wounded in the blasts. On Friday, the working-class Baghdad neighborhood was burying its dead and still finding parts of children's bodies on the site of the attacks. The attacks followed another car bombing west of the capital that killed one US soldier and two Iraqis, according to the military. Bloodshed also spread to northern Iraq with four killed and 16 wounded in a car bombing in Tall Afar, where US and Iraqi forces battled insurgents in early September. In other violence, a soldier with US-led forces whose nationality was not immediately known was killed in a rocket attack on an American military support base near Baghdad. In the northern oil city of Kirkuk, the tortured body of a security guard for the Kurdish mayor was found, while the Sunni Muslim imam of a mosque in Mosul was gunned down in the street by unidentified assailants. US warplanes earlier on Thursday raided what the military termed a suspected safe house of Iraq's most-wanted man Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi's northeast of Fallujah. Medics said three people were killed and 14 wounded in the strike, one of a repeated series around and in Fallujah which the US military says targets Zarqawi's organisation, blamed for dozens of car bombings, assassinations and kidnappings in Iraq. Doctors and residents have said casualties from the air strikes include women and children. Britain meanwhile hoped desperately to free 62-year-old British engineer Kenneth Bigley, kidnapped by his group on September 16 in Baghdad, along with two US colleagues who were savagely beheaded last week. In London, Allawi called Bigley's ordeal "repugnant" and said journalists had a moral duty to question themselves whether the showing of hostage videos was not fueling the crisis, which took another turn for the worse Thursday. Al-Jazeera showed a purported tape from an Islamist militant group calling itself "Islamic Army in Iraq - Western Region Command" announcing it was holding the 10 hostages including the two Indonesian women. Meanwhile, a self-declared French mediator arrived in Beirut after having claimed he had secured a deal for the release of two French reporters kidnapped by the Islamic Army in Iraq on August 20. Against a backdrop of extreme tension in Paris over the independent endeavour, the foreign ministry separately rushed an envoy to Amman.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[India's inflation dropped by 0.07 percentage points despite high world oil prices as the government sought to rein in prices and maintain growth in Asia's fourth-largest economy, official data showed Friday. Inflation dipped to 7.80 percent in the week ended September 18 from 7.87 percent a week earlier as food, especially fruits and vegetables, became cheaper, the figures showed. The government has introduced a wave of duty cuts on petroleum products to help consumers and combat inflation, which has shot up from 4.32 percent in late April driven by high global oil prices. India, the world's biggest edible oil importer, has also slashed base import prices of palm oils and crude soy oil and cut duties on steel. The drop in inflation follows good news on the growth front. India's economy in the April-June quarter expanded 7.4 percent as growth in manufacturing and tourism offset a slowdown in agriculture. The figure beat market expectations as the economy is under pressure from erratic monsoon rains that are expected to hurt the key agriculture sector and from rising oil prices.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[As the first debate between US President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry illustrated, Washington remains sharply at odds over how to handle North Korea. Kerry accused Bush of losing control of the North Korean nuclear standoff and making the world a much more dangerous place in the process by refusing to engage in one-on-one dialogue with the Stalinist state. Bush argued that only through so-called six-way talks involving regional powers could the Pyongyang be forced to comply with its commitments to disarm. Kerry said Washington has lost its way on North Korea since Bush took office. Four years ago, then president Bill Clinton sent his secretary of state Madeleine Albright to Pyongyang for talks with leader Kim Jong-Il as the United States and North Korea rapidly converged along a path of reconciliation. On taking office in 2001, Bush reversed that policy and ordered a full review of US-North Korean ties. In so doing he upset his own Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had initially said the reconciliation process inherited from Clinton would continue, Kerry said. Bush also sent then-South Korean president Kim Dae-Jung home from a state visit to Washington "bewildered and embarrassed" after speaking out against Seoul's policy of reconciliation with North Korea, Kerry said. Bush reserved his sharpest public criticism of the Stalinist state for his State of the Union address of 2002, when he accused Pyongyang of weapons proliferation and included North Korea in his 'axis of evil' along with Iran and Iraq. Hawks in Washington applauded Bush's hard-line on Pyongyang and hoped that it would spell an end to the Agreed Framework, a 1994 accord signed between the Clinton administration and the communist leaders in Pyongyang that ended a previous nuclear standoff. Under that accord Pyongyang undertook in direct talks with Washington to freeze its plutonium-based nuclear weapons programme in return for fuel aid and the construction of two light-water reactors by a US-led consortium. Republican hawks have always considered that North Korea was awarded too much for too little under the agreement that unravelled in October 2002, when Washington accused Pyongyang of pursuing a separate nuclear weapons programme based on highly enriched uranium -- sparking a second nuclear standoff that remains unresolved. Accusing Pyongyang of breaking its word in one-on-one negotiations 10 years ago, Bush has steadfastly refused to go one-on-one with the Pyongyang regime to end the latest standoff, instead relying on six-nation talks that also include the two Korea, China, Russia, and Japan. In Thursday's debate, Bush referred to the five nations engaged in dialogue with North Korea as a "coalition" and suggested solidarity with the United States. However, China, Russia, Japan, and South Korea have all urged Washington to come to the table for direct talks with North Korea at different times in the past and the view in North East Asia is that bilateral talks must ultimately take place if the standoff is ever to be resolved.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[President Vladimir Putin sent his warm congratulations Friday to Chinese President Hu Jintao as Russia's neighboring Asian giant celebrated the 55th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. Putin said the two were quickly repairing ties on all levels after decades of mistrust in the Cold War era, now focusing their joint efforts in the fight against terror in the Central Asian region and on other security issues. "With all my heart, I congratulate you and the Chinese people with the 55th anniversary of the formation of the People's Republic of China," a Kremlin statement quoted Putin's letter to Hu as saying. "We have all the prerequisites for reaching a new level of strategic partnership, which is one of the most important factors for maintaining peace not only in this region, but also throughout the world," Putin wrote. Putin said Moscow and Beijing must thus pool their efforts "to stand up against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations." Russia and China are fighting campaigns against separatists that both brand as "terrorists" -- with Russia fighting Chechens in the Caucasus in China cracking down on Muslim Uighur in western China, among other splinter groups in the world's most populous country. Most recently, relations between Moscow and Beijing have focused on oil, with China pressing for a proposed pipeline from vast Russian Siberian oil fields that are also being contested by its rival Japan, with Russia wavering between the two.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ABUJA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo on Friday warned that his government will not tolerate any "undue militancy" in the oil-rich Niger Delta or any action that would compromise the majority interest, in a speech to mark 44 years of independence from Britain. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," he said in a broadcast. "Government will not tolerate in any way or form any act that would mortgage or compromise the interest of the majority." But he confirmed that his government was holding talks with rebel leaders from the Niger Delta and assured that a "rapprochement" was taking place. "We are talking to those I describe as rascally elements from the Niger Delta in an effort to open lines of dialogue and peace as they feel aggrieved by their state authorities," he said, referring to rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari. Asari began talks Wednesday with officials in Obasanjo's government ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to pull out of Niger Delta. A statement issued late Monday by Asari advised oil majors to leave the Delta, which pumps the bulk of Nigeria's output of 2.3 million barrels per day, and warned that his Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF) would declare "all-out war" against the government Friday if the demands were not met. The group, which says it is fighting for self-determination and a bigger share of Nigeria's oil wealth for the Niger Delta's Ijaw people, is demanding a sovereign national conference on the country's problems. "The obvious assessment so far is that not much impact has been made on the lives and living standards of most ordinary people of the Niger Delta," Obasanjo said in his speech. "I appeal to those elected officials of the region whose efforts have not measured up to expectations, to endeavour to be seen to be more alive to their responsibilities and the plight of the people they are elected to govern," he said. Some officials told AFP that Obasanjo was particularly unhappy with some state governors in the volatile region who do not judiciously use money allocated to their states by the federal government to provide social facilities for their people. Obasanjo appealed to residents in the region to be patient. "I want to appeal to all Nigerians that rascality and vandalism, which are rapidly becoming the hallmark of the Niger Delta, have implications for the production, distribution and pricing of crude oil, for our global economic rating, for investor confidence in our economy," he said. Crude oil exports account for 95 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income and about 65 percent of budgetary revenues. The west African country is Africa's largest and OPEC's sixth bant Commander Yakubu Agwom told AFP, meanwhile, that his forces were combing villages and creeks in the Niger Delta in search of illegal arms. "We have intensified cordon and search operations in the swamps, villages and creeks. Our efforts have paid off," Agwom said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[British Energy, looking to restructuring, posts heavy losses.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[British Energy announced on Friday a first-quarter net loss after exceptional items of 115 million pounds (168 million euros, 208 million dollars) and said it was making progress in a bid to de-list its shares as part of a debt-restructuring programme. The troubled nuclear group recorded an operating loss after exceptional items of 36 million pounds in the three months to June 30. Turnover stood at 372 million pounds for the first quarter. There was no comparison with the first quarter of 2003 because British Energy began publishing quarterly data only last December. The group, preparing to de-list its shares as part of a government-backed debt restructuring, said its first-quarter showing was affected by lower-than-expected output from its eight nuclear power stations. British Energy last week announced plans to de-list its shares from the London Stock Exchange to thwart leading shareholders from blocking an EU-approved bail-out. "British Energy is continuing to work hard on its proposed restructuring," the company said in a statement accompanying the results. The decision to de-list its shares came after the European Commission approved a multi-billion pound bailout for British Energy after securing guarantees that the company would not breach EU competition rules. The EU executive said it was satisfied that British-government subsidies of 3.48 billion pounds were solely to support the costs of decommissioning nuclear plants. Shareholders have shown anger that they will be left with only a 2.5-percent stake in the firm following the EU-backed bail-out and say they are entitled to more. But British Energy received a major boost Thursday when rebel shareholders Polygon Investment Partners gave up its bid to derail the rescue package. The government-backed restructuring, which was agreed last year but needs state aid clearance from the European Commission, involves also banks and bondholders agreeing to write off debt worth 1.3 billion pounds in return for control of the group.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A former army commander in Zambia who worked under ex-president Frederick Chiluba has been arrested and charged with five counts of corruption involving more than one million dollars, an official said Friday. General Geojago Musengule was arrested and jointly charged with businessman Amon Sibande over several dubious fuel supply contracts to the army, corruption taskforce spokesman Mpazi Sinyangwe told AFP. Sibande ran a private firm, Base Chemicals, that supplied fuel to the army. "The duo were arrested on Thursday and charged with five counts of abuse of office and corruption. They have been released on bond and will appear in court on October 13," Sinyangwe said. Musengule has also been charged with other counts for allegedly receiving "gratification" payments for awarding fuel supply contracts to Sibande without following tender procedures. Musengule was up to now the only former military and security chief who served under Chiluba who was not affected by corruption investigations launched by President Levy Mwanawasa in 2002. Chiluba currently faces eight charges related to the embezzlement of one million dollars, while former intelligence chief Xavier Chungu has been arrested and charged with corruption, abuse of office and theft of public funds.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japan's biggest beef-bowl fast food restaurant chain on Friday said it has cut its net profit forecast as Tokyo's ban on US beef imports continues to depress sales. Yoshinoya D and C said it increased its net loss forecast for the year to February 2005 to 2.54 billion yen (23 million dollars) from an initial estimate of 1.88 billion yen. Citing continued sluggish sales, the company also forecast a deeper recurring loss of 2.12 billion yen, compared with the 900 million yen projected earlier. Revenue is now seen at 115.2 billion yen, down from an initial estimate of 122.3 billion yen. Japan has refused to lift its ban on US beef since it took effect in December immediately after the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States. Yoshinoya had used US beef for 99 percent of its needs but was forced to stop serving its popular 'gyudon' beef-on-rice dish in February, when stored supplies ran out. Alternative items on the menu, such as pork and curry, have failed to make up the difference. Media reports have speculated Tokyo might agree to lift the ban by the end of the year but Japan, previously the number one market for US beef, has insisted on testing all US beef imports as a condition. Washington has rejected Tokyo's demand for screening every slaughtered cow for mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, known as BSE. Japanese farm ministry officsault at the special court on the island of just 47 people half-way between New Zealand and South America, Radio New Zealand reported. Brown, a tractor driver, is one of seven men being tried on sex abuse allegations dating back decades which have torn apart the small community founded by mutineers from the British navy ship HMS Bounty in 1790. In the first trial which opened Wednesday the island's mayor Steve Christian, a direct descendant of Bounty mutiny leader Fletcher Christian, pleaded not guilty to six charges of rape and four of indecent assault. Prosecutors told the court that Brown, whose 78-year-old father Len Brown is also on trial, believed he could use girls whenever he wanted and that he regularly preyed on females on the island over a 21-year-period. New Zealand lower court judges are hearing two simultaneous court sittings which are occasionally joined to take video link evidence from the eight female complainants in New Zealand. A 51-year-oldy video-link said that as a young girl, aged either 11 or 12, she had been targeted and raped by Christian four times, once being held down by Christian and two other men. The other defendants are the mayor's son, Randy Christian 30, island chairman Jay Warren 48, postmaster Dennis Christian 49 and Terry Young 45. The defendants are on bail and some of them rowed the longboat which bought three judges from New Zealand onto the island, which has no harbour or airport. The men, if found guilty, face lengthy jail terms. The British are building a minimum-security jail on the island. Pitcairn remained uninhabited until Fletcher Christian's mutiny on April 28, 1789 against Captain William Bligh, who was set adrift in the Pacific. Eight mutineers along with six Tahitian men, 12 Tahitian women and a small girl then searched the South Seas for a haven, reaching uninhabited Pitcairn on January 15, 1790. Little was known of Pitcairn's darker side until a 1997 book, "Serpent in Paradise", by British journalist Dea Birkett who said Pitcairners "developed relationships considered unacceptable elsewhere". Then in 1999, a Pitcairn woman laid a complaint which led to a British police investigation code-named 'Operation Unique'. Six other island men charged with sex crimes have yet to be extradited from Australia and New Zealand. The men were charged under Britains Sexual Offences Act, and the defendants are expected to base their defence on the legality of the law on the island.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Malaysia's national carmaker Proton is in talks with Volkswagen AG to form a strategic partnership that could give the German giant a foothold in Southeast Asia's fast-growing auto market, a report said Friday. "We are talking with Proton for opportunities in mutual cooperation," a Volkswagen spokesman in Germany, Hartwig von Sass, told the Asian Wall Street Journal. The newspaper quoted sources familiar with the matter as saying that it was unclear if a prospective deal would involve Volkswagen taking a significant equity stake in publicly listed Proton, which now holds around 45 percent of the local market. A tie-up would give Volkswagen access to Proton's production facilities to produce cars for sale in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), it said. Although Volkswagen is the biggest foreign auto maker in China with nearly 30 percent of the market, it has a negligible presence in Southeast Asia. Proton spokewoman Fauziyah Abu Hassan refused to confirm or deny talks with Volkswagen, citing a "non-disclosure agreement." She indicated, however, that the 38-percent government-owned Proton would not cede management control to any potential foreign partner because "it is in the best interest of Proton to remain as Malaysia's national car company." Proton chief executive Mahaleel Ariff earlier this week said the company aimed to tie up with a new foreign partner by the end of the year, ahead of the market opening in 2005 under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). Special adviser to the company, former premier Mahathir Mohamad, has said Proton was in talks with South Korean and German carmakers but did not elaborate. Under AFTA, import tariffs for most vehicles in the region were cut to below five percent in the past year. Malaysia obtained a two-year reprieve for its auto industry until 2005 but has said it would defer reducing duties to the required level until 2008.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Embattled West Brom look to Sir Bobby.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Struggling English Premiership side West Brom have reportedly offered the manager's job to Sir Bobby Robson once Gary Megson is sacked. But Robson, 71, has told chairman Jeremy Peace he wants to do nothing which could lead to Megson losing his job, British newspapers reported Friday. And Peace may now turn to former West Brom favourite Bryan Robson to appease the clubs fans. The ex-England and Manchester United captain has been out of work since leaving Bradford in the summer. Megson is convinced his reign will be over after Saturday's home game against Bolton - whether the third-bottom club win, lose or draw. "Of course theres extra pressure. I can read and I have seen and heard whats being said," Megson, 45, told The Sun. "This is all part of the territory of being a football manager. Whether its right or whether its wrong is not for me to say." West Brom are still looking for their first victory this term and have lost four of their last five games. But the clubs fans are still 100 per cent behind Megson. They chanted his name during their last home game, a 1-1 draw with Fulham on September 18. Megson added: "The hard thing is for the players to win in such an atmosphere. "I have a great rapport with the supporters. It was very humbling for me at the last game and I found it difficult to take. "Most of the fans recognise that when I came here we were battling for results." Albion face Bolton without Darren Purse who has had a three-game ban added to the one-match suspension he already faced. Defender Purse, yellow-carded twice in Saturdays 3-1 defeat at Newcastle, was found guilty by the FA s video panel of accidentally elbowing team-mate Ricky Scimeca -- while aiming for Andy OBrien. Robson told The Daily Mirror: "I'm enjoying something of a rest for the first time in quite a long time. But I'm definitely not ready to call it a day, believe me. "I'm ready for the next job - but the one thing that is for sure is that it will definitely have to be the right job." Robson has managed England, Fulham, Ipswich, PSV Eindhoven, Sporting Lisbon, Porto, Barcelona, Newcastle.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Head of wildlife trade body warns of dense rules.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The head of the world body regulating trade in endangered animals has warned the system was too complicated and was making it difficult to police the multi-billion dollar wildlife industry. Willem Wijnstekers, secretary-general of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), called for a simpler system as delegates from 166 countries gathered for the latest meeting in Bangkok. CITES, signed 31 years ago, is the biggest and most successful treaty regulating the lucrative wildlife products industry and is responsible for the 15-year ban on the international ivory trade. "It is appropriate for me to once again ask for your cooperation to help solve what I believe has been and still is a major problem with CITES: overcomplication," said Wijnstekers in a newsletter released ahead of the conference. "I have reiterated the view that CITES has become too complicated to implement and enforce. in many cases it is totally unclear why we have complicated things so much and what the conservation benefits of certain measures are today." The system provides trade protection for species threatened through over-harvesting, pollution and habitat destruction. The convention places 5,000 animal and nearly 29,000 plant species in one of three categories that range from a ban on international trading to allowing limited selling through a series of permits and quotas. Wijnstekers said some of the regulations had become unwieldy and, in the newsletter published in July, urged those gathering in Bangkport his actions to police. Mountford faces five counts of indecent assault, one charge of unlawful sexual intercourse and two counts of procuring the commission of an act of gross indecency, Ellison said. A South Australian police spokeswoman said Mountford's extradition had been approved and the process was underway. Ellison said Australian police originally tried to locate Mountford last month in Britain, but the former cleric fled to Thailand, where he was arrested only days after his arrival. "This sends a very clear message that we will not give up on the pursuit of those people who violate the innocence of children," Ellison said. "In Mr Mountford's case these are serious charges and the government wants him back in Australia to face an Australian court." News of Mountford's arrest came as Australian police pursued the biggest roundup of pedophile suspects in the country's history. Nearly 200 people have been arrested so far this week in a crackdown on Internet child pornography and police officials said they expected the number of arrests to top 500.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices eased slightly on Friday as Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that his government would not tolerate any "undue militancy" in the oil-rich Niger Delta. The price of light sweet crude for November delivery fell 21 cents to 49.43 dollars a barrel in pre-opening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November slipped 13 cents to 46.25 dollars in electronic deals. Oil prices hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in after-hours New York deals on Monday and 46.80 dollars in London on Tuesday amid unrest in Nigeria. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," Obasanjo said in a televised speech on Friday to mark 44 years of Nigerian independence from Britain. Obasanjo said his government was continuing to hold talks with rebel leaders from the Niger Delta and assured that a "rapprochement" was taking place. Rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari began talks on Wednesday with officials in Obasanjo's government ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to pull out of Niger Delta. Crude oil exports account for 95 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income and about 65 percent of budgetary revenues. "Nigerian oil is seen as crucial (by markets) because it is light, sweet oil, favoured by refineries and currently in short supply while there is a glut of sour crude," analysts at the Sucden brokerage firm said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Japanese shares to post modest gains amid continued oil price concerns.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japanese shares are likely to edge up next week, building on the gains made Friday after a better-than-expected Tankan survey of business confidence but persistent concerns over high oil prices will keep investors in check, dealers said. They said oil prices and also the note of caution on the economic outlook reflected in the Tanakan's forecasts for the fourth quarter will temper any enthusiasm and likely keep any advance limited. The tone of the market has improved since the Nikkei index rebounded on Thursday after a nine-day losing streak, said Masatoshi Sato, analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities. "If oil prices are stable or fall, Japanese stocks should gain," he said. For the week to October 1, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index advanced 90.01 points or 0.83 percent to 10,985.17. The broader TOPIX index of all TSE first section shares rose 14.92 or 1.35 percent to 1,117.29 in the past week. A gain of 1.49 percent Friday after the Bank of Japan's key Tankan report showed business sentiment in the September quarter among large manufacturers was at a 13-year high helped more than erase the losses seen earlier in the week. At the same time, however, the Tankan pointed to a slight slowdown in the coming months and this may give investors pause for thought as the market once again faces resistance at 11,000 points. "The uncertain outlook for the Japanese economy could affect the behavior of foreign investors and might weigh on the market," said Masayoshi Yano, analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. Oil prices were easier after hitting a record high of 50.47 dollars per barrel in New York after-hours trading Monday on supply concerns. "If oil prices stay around the 50 dollar level, or if they rise even higher, Japanese shares might become top-heavy again," Yano said. Sato and Yano both said they expected the market to be quite be volatile in the coming week, with the 11,000 level as key resistance. During the past week, average daily volume on the main board was 1.34 billion shares, flat from the previous week, with turnover edging up to 1.08 trillion yen (9.8 billion dollars) from 1.02 trillion yen. A wide range of shares advanced, with most of their gains made on Friday. Hitachi gained six yen or 0.91 percent to 664 while Fujitsu advanced five yen or 0.79 percent to 641 for the week. Sony was up 60 yen or 1.61 percent to 3,780 yen while NEC was flat at 658 yen. Toyota Motor gained 60 yen or 1.45 percent to 4,210 yen as Nissan Motor climbed seven yen or 0.58 percent to 1,210 yen.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[FRANKFURT, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Citigroup chief executive Charles Prince ruled out the idea of merging with Deutsche Bank in a newspaper interview on Friday, arguing that such a move would be too costly and offer too few synergies. "A deal between two capital market players, which is what a tie-up with Deutsche Bank would be, would bring with it additional financial burdens," Prince told the Financial Times Deutschland in remarks reproduced in German. "If you combine two operations each with a market share of five percent, you don't get a market share of 10 percent, because customers re-allocate their business" to rivals, Prince argued. The comments were the first official remarks by the world's biggest financial services group since the failure of merger talks with Germany's biggest bank at the beginning of this year. Prince said a purchase of Deutsche Bank would be too expensive. An acquisition of an investment bank "must be at such an attractive price that it offsets the related loss in earnings", the Citigroup chief said. "I don't see such a transaction." The merger plans between Citigroup and Deutsche Bank sparked an internal conflict within Germany's biggest bank, with chairman Josef Ackermann accused of pursuing a tie-up with a major foreign player at any cost and of neglecting the domestic banking market and focussing more on international investment banking activities.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[STRASBOURG, France, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met Friday in the eastern French city of Strasbourg for informal talks focused on Turkey's bid to join the EU and Iraq. Foreign ministers Michel Barnier of France and Joschka Fischer of Germany attended the talks, part of a series of informal bilateral meetings held every six to eight weeks in order to coordinate policy on European issues. The French and German leaders were expected to hold a joint press conference at about midday (1000 GMT). Chirac and Schroeder were then to attend a reception at Strasbourg city hall commemorating the 60th anniversary of its liberation from Nazi rule, which took place on November 20 and 21, 1944, followed by a private lunch. Turkey's bid to join the 25-nation European Union could top Friday's agenda, with the bloc's enlargement commissioner Guenter Verheugen due to release a key report on Ankara's progress toward the start of EU entry talks next week. Chirac and Schroeder have both backed Turkey's eventual EU membership, but a majority of the French people is opposed to its entry in principle, an opinion poll released this week showed. Chirac's ruling center-right Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party is also against Turkey's bid. French Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Foreign Minister Michel Barnier have backed the idea of a referendum on the issue. In Germany, opposition Christian Democratic Union chief Angela Merkel has recently tried to rally support among European conservatives against Turkish EU membership, calling instead for a "privileged partnership" with the bloc. The financing of the EU's 2007-2013 budget was also expected to be discussed, according to Chirac's office. "Unfortunately there are limits as to how much we can spend. We have to be reasonable," Chirac said in September at a summit in Madrid with Schroeder and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. On Iraq, Chirac and Schroeder were likely to discuss a planned international conference on organizing elections in Iraq. Egypt is a leading candidate to host the meeting in November, US Secretary of State Colin Powell told AFP. Barnier said earlier this week that any conference ought to address the questions of whether US-led forces should leave Iraq, and should include representatives of the armed opposition.]]></c>

Qassam rockets are fired by the hardline Hamas group and named after its armed wing -- the Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades. The Israeli daily Haaretz said Friday that the army was set take control of nine-kilometer (6-mile) buffer zone from the northern Gaza Strip borders with Israel up to the outskirts of Jabaliya. The paper noted that the Qassam rockets have a firing range of around nine kilometers. The rockets can carry of five-kilogram (11-pound) charge. "The army can hope mainly to gain time by temporarily reducing the threat on Sderot, in the hope that meanwhile, some agreement, also temporary, will be clinched with Palestinian security organizations to stop the shooting," wrote the paper. "Palestinians must pay the price," read an editorial in the mass-circulation paper Yediot Ahar start of the intifada, or uprising, four years ago. They include 3,371 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count. In other developments, Israeli police decided to limit access to Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound as it said it feared disturbances for the fourth anniversary of the intifada, or Palestinian uprising. Only women and men aged above 40 will be authorized to pray at the compound after mid-day. A controversial visit by then opposition leader Sharon to the site, sacred to both Muslims and Jews, sparked the first clashes of the intifada on September 28, 2000.

Thailand, one of the world's largest exporters before the bird flu crisis hit, also said it would overhaul its system of poultry farming to try to prevent future crises. Officials earlier this week confirmed its first probable case of human-to-human infection of bird flu following the deaths of a mother and daughter. At least 10 people have died in Thailand and 19 in Vietnam from bird flu during two waves of outbreaks this year that have killed millions of birds from across the region. The two confirmed and two suspected cases within a single Thai family in the last week raised concerns that the disease had mutated into a more contagious and lethal form that could trigger a global pandemic. A mutated bird flu outbreak was blamed for the deaths of as many as 40 million people worldwide in 1918. Thai health officials said early indications were that the strain had not changed much and nobody outside of the family had been infected, but tests continued in US and Thai laboratories to discover the full picture. But the health ministry said Friday it had sent bird flu testing kits and anti-virus drugs to 700 countries across the country to cope with a potential outbreak among humans. The probable human-to-human case prompted the Thai government to step up its fight against the disease. Thousands of unpaid volunteers, part of a group set up 20 years ago and given some medical training, began work on Friday, according to Thawat Suntrajarn, director general of the Disease Control department. "More than 900,000 of our volunteers, assigned to oversee some 10 households each, will go house-to-house and check the condition of both humans and poultry," he said. A 1,000-strong team of veterinarians and epidemiologists was also being formed to move in swiftly if volunteers warned of suspect cases. "Most of what you would like to see is being done here," said Scott Dowell, of the US Centers for Disease Control, which is examining samples from the Thai family outbreak. "There's careful surveillance all around the original family cluster and they've identified areas where chickens are sick and dying and culled all of the poultry." Bird flu has struck 32 of Thailand's 76 provinces since July in the second wave of cases this year and badly hit poultry sales overseas. Chaturon Chaisang, deputy prime minister and head of the country's bird flu task force, said Friday that the second wave of Corporation Lane. At a public ceremony the band's guitarist and founding member, Angus Young, responded to the honour by telling pedestrians, "Welcome to the Highway to Hell", a reference to another AC/DC hit. Melbourne Lord Mayor John So preferred describing the newly dubbed street as "a laneway to heaven" and urging the fans present to pump their fists in the air -- just as AC/DC concert-goers did in the band's 1970s heyday. The new AC/DC Lane runs parallel to Swanston Street, a major Melbourne thoroughfare where the band filmed the video-clip for "Long Way To The Top" while riding on the back of a truck. AC/DC also called Melbourne home during the 1970s and two of its members were born in the city. The city council was initially nervous about the proposal to rename the laneway and, for a while, dropped the plan after local shopowners protested that it would not reflect the commercial character and history of the street. Instead, it considered a proposal to erect a series of plaques along Swanston Street recognising famous Australian musicians. But late last month city officials revived the idea after more than 50 submissions from AC/DC fans. The plan also attracted five objections, including one from a Queensland church. The city council has made several replicas of the new sign in the expectation that fans will try to, and perhaps succeed in, stealing the street's new nameplate. The vintage hard rock band has had numerous hits that are still staples on classic rock radio worldwide, including Back in Black, Highway to Hell and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Inamoto on track for long-term deal with West Brom by Mark Ogden.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WREXHAM, Wales, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japan midfielder Junichi Inamoto believes he is on track to secure a permanent contract at English Premiership side West Brom after making his comeback from a four-month injury lay-off. Inamoto, Japan's outstanding player at the 2002 World Cup, played for the first time since suffering a broken leg against England in June in a 45-minute run out as West Bromwich Albion's reserves lost 4-1 to Liverpool here on Thursday. The 25-year-old, who suffered the injury in the closing stages of Japan's 1-1 friendly draw with England in Manchester on June 1, looked sharp during the goalless first half before making way for substitute Adam Chambers. "There is no problem with the injury, although it still hurts slightly when I play, especially in the reserves where tackles fly in," he admitted after the match. "But after 45 minutes, I was not tired and things are going better than expected. But I felt it was the right time to come off." Premiership newcomers West Brom signed the former Fulham midfielder earlier this season on the proviso that he proves his fitness before the transfer window re-opens in January. Albion will then pay J-League club Gamba Osaka an initial 200,000 dollars to make the transfer permanent. Having trained only four times since arriving at The Hawthorns in August, Inamoto visibly tired in the later stages of the first-half, but he showed no adverse reaction to his injury, standing up to tough challenges from Liverpool youngsters John Welsh and Neil Mellor. And Inamoto was unlucky not to create a goal for Macedonia's international playmaker Artim Sakiri when he released him in the penalty area early in the first-half. However, Sakiri's close-range strike was well saved by the Liverpool goalkeeper Chris Kirkland. Despite his return to action, however, Inamoto is unlikely to be in contention for Japan's World Cup qualifier against Oman in Muscat on October 13 with West Brom manager Gary Megson admitting that the player is still some distance from full match fitness. Megson said: "Junichi has got to get his fitness back. At the moment he is doing well and is a very talented player on the ball. But he has only trained four times with us since he came here and his fitness levels are way behind all the other players. "We knew that he was injured when we signed him, so we have to take things very carefully. We do not want to rush him back. We signed him because we thought he would be an asset to the club, but that will have to wait. "I wanted to keep him playing against Liverpool reserves for as long as his legs would hold up, but he will not be fit for consideration for the Bolton game on Saturday. I am sure he will be able to help us, but he is some way off yet and hopefully when he is fit to play, we will not be in the position that we are currently in in the table." Rob Elvins opened the scoring for West Brom in the 52nd minute, but Liverpool fought back to win thanks to goals from Darren Potter, Neil Mellor (2) and Robbie Foy.]]></c>

Indonesia's previous parliament was plagued by absenteeism, with many legislators taking advantage of five-star hotel accommodation but failing to attend sessions.

But Bambang Widjojanto of the Partnership for Governance Reform said new measures did not go far enough and greater controls, including a "caucus" of self-regulation, were needed to keep lawmakers in check.

		<t><![CDATA[Blair undergoes heart procedure, eyes 'full third term' by Robert MacPherson.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair was admitted to hospital Friday to correct an irregular heartbeat, a day after announcing that he intends to serve a full third term if re-elected. With his wife Cherie at his side, Blair checked into Hammersmith Hospital in west London for a relatively routine operation to restore his heart rhythm, called a catheter ablation, that will require only local anesthetic. Asked how he felt as he left Downing Street, his official residence, Blair -- who underwent a different procedure for the same problem in October last year -- waved, smiled and replied: "Fine." "It's not particularly alarming, but it's something that you should get fixed. It's a routine procedure," he said in a television interview Thursday evening in which he disclosed the operation. "I've had it for the last couple of months, and it's not impeded me doing my work and feeling fine, but it is as well to get it done." Beyond his heart problem, Blair used the interview to drop a political bombshell -- that he intends to serve "a full third term", but no more, if his Labour Party wins the next general election. If the election comes next year, as many expect, that means Blair -- who led Labour to power in 1997 and 2001, and who has never been so unequivocal about his long-term plans -- could be prime minister until as late as 2010. "The decision as to who is the prime minister of the country is the decision of the British people. They're the boss," he told BBC television. "But if I am elected, I would serve a full third term," he said. "I do not want to serve a fourth term. I don't think the British people would want a prime minister to go on that long, but I think it's sensible to make plain my intention now." Blair was due to be discharged from hospital later Friday, then rest over the weekend before he leaves London later next week for an official visit to Ethiopia. "I wouldn't worry too much about it (the operation) at all," Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told GMTV television Friday. "The cardiologist has assured us it's something that can be done quite quickly and quite effectively," he said. "He (Blair) assures everybody, and I fully expect it, that he will get on with his job." One of Britain's leading cardiologists, Andrew Grace of Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, eastern England, said the procedure Blair was undergoing Friday has a high success rate. "It is very safe, effective and well tolerated procedure to cure these sorts of issues," he told BBC radio, adding that his own hospital will do about 500 such procedures next year with a 95 percent success rate. Blair's double-barreled announcement about his hospital treatment and his intention toprivate house in exclusive Connaught Square, west London. The Georgian row house cost 3.6 million pounds (5.25 million euros, 6.51 million dollars) -- and happens to be a stone's throw from Edgware Road, the heart of Britain's expatriate Arab community.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Australian share prices are expected to continue their recent strong run next after hitting a succession of record highs in the last few days, dealers said Friday. They said that despite the record breaking performance, the Australian stock market looks set for further sustained gains on the back of still reasonable stock valuations and a strong economy. There seems to be no impact -- for the moment at least -- from the upcoming October 9 federal elections. The benchmark SP/ASX 200 index ended the week 24 points or 0.66 percent higher at 3,659.6 while the broader All Ordinaries rose 16.4 points to 3,669.0., falling just short of their record performance as profit-taking set in Friday. AMP Capital Investors head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said while the market is vulnerable to a short-term consolidation or correction after having had such a strong run, the broad outlook remains bright. "Strong profits and dividends have served to keep the market relatively cheap, interest rates are still relatively low and there is certainly no evidence of the euphoric investor optimism that is always present at major market tops," Oliver said. He said dividend yields on shares are now roughly equal to the yield on bonds, noting that the last time this occurred was March last year after which shares provided much better returns than bonds. "While total returns from Australian shares will slow from the double digit gains of the past year, returns over the next 12 months should still be reasonable and enough to take the local market indices (SP/ASX 200 and All Ords) to above 3,850 points in 12 months time." CommSec chief economist Craig James said the market is experiencing its strongest upturn for a decade. He said since bottoming in early March 2003, the All Ordinaries has risen 35 percent but that performance is even more impressive when dividends are included, with the All Ordinaries Accumulation index gaining 45 pct. James said despite the market's recent strength, valuations are not stretched with the price earnings multiple for the top 200 stocks at 15.3 times current year forecast earnings, below the decade average of 17.4. "In short, the current share market upturn has further to go," James said National Australia bank finished the week nine cents up at 27.04 dollars while Rio Tinto gained 1.1l dollars to close at 38.35 dollars.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Guinea-Bissau's President Henrique Rosa has called on the United Nations to withdraw its peace-building mission from the west African nation, arguing that the political instability that led to its creation five years ago no longer exists, the Lusa news agency reported Friday. But Rosa, who was appointed interim president following a military coup which ousted controversial president Kumba Yala in September 2003, added that a continued UN presence in Guinea-Bissau is vital to help respond to "shortcomings and the basics needs of the people", the agency said. Rosa said in comments published in the Bissau weekly Gazeta de Noticias on Thursday that the continued presence of the UN force in the country would give the impression to international observers that the political situation in the former Portuguese colony is still volatile. The United Nations Peace-building Support Office (UNOGBIS) was set up in 1999 to help Guinea stabilize after a crippling one-year civil war. Guinea-Bissau held parliamentary elections in March and is scheduled to hold a presidential ballot next year. The country -- wedged between Senegal and Guinea on Africa's Atlantic coast -- is heavily dependent on foreign aid, and its main foreign exchange earner is cashew nuts.

		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Philippine share prices are expected to continue their recent advance into next week thanks to fresh foreign investor interest, which should be help offset concerns over record oil prices, dealers said Friday. So far this year, the Manila market is one of the best performing in the region, with foreign investors prepared to put in relatively modest amounts of money in the hope President Gloria Arroyo will deliver much needed economic reform. If Arroyo achieves this and brings the budget deficit under control, the upside could be quite significant on even a quite small investment. At the same time, foreign investor interest encourages their local counterparts and also helps ease the pressure on the peso, which has recently traded to record lows against the dollar. "More foreign funds are coming in and these will likely help sustain the market's current strength next week," said Elena Ponceca of Unicapital Securities, putting resistance at 1,810 points. However, AB Capital Securities warned that "the sustainability and magnitude of gains may depend on how oil and the world markets behave. "For now, we see support at 1,750 points while resistance is at 1,800," said AB Capital analyst Jovis Vistan. For the week to October 1, the Philippine Stock Exchange composite index gained 23.95 points or 1.36 percent to 1,787.25 points, its highest closing level since April 10, 2000, when it settled at 1,796.66. Average daily turnover was 1.20 billion shares worth 883 million pesos (15.68 million dollars) after 1.39 billion shares worth 847 million pesos in the previous week.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indonesian police on Friday announced a breakthrough in the hunt for militants behind last month's attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta, naming the suicide bomber who delivered the deadly blast. Police chief Da'i Bachtiar said DNA tests comparing samples found at the scene of the blast with tissue and blood from suspects' families confirmed the bomber's identity as Heri Kurniawan, alias Golun. "We have a very strong conviction that this person carried the bomb and died in the explosion," Bachtiar told reporters. Nine other people were killed and more than 180 were injured in the September 9 attack, which has been blamed in the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group. Bachtiar said tests were being carried out on two further samples to determine if there were any other suicide bombers in the minivan which carried the bomb at the time it exploded. Police last week arrested a man carrying a letter from Kurniawan, who lived in the Sukabumi district in the west of Indonesia's Java island, in which he sought forgiveness from his wife and parents for the bombing. Indonesia's chief detective Suyitno Landung, who is leading the hunt for the bombing masterminds, said the letter appealed to Kurniawan's then-pregnant wife to name their son Rahmad Jundullah, or soldier of God. "Basically the letter contains apologies and asks for permission to die as a martyr," Landung said. A photograph of Kurniawan taken in December 2003 was released by police, who displayed a copy of his marriage certificate showing he was wed last year. Bachtiar added that police had found the house from which the bomb-laden vehicle left 12 hours before the blast. "We don't know whether it was the last place where the bomb was assembled," he said. A total of 16 people have so far been arrested over the embassy blast, although only five of them have been officially declared suspects. Bachtiar said some of those in custody had claimed they belonged to an organisation known as the Islamic State of Indonesia, a largely ideological group with no established links to extremist violence. Police have named two Malaysians Azahari Husin and Noordin Muhammad Top, as prime suspects in the embassy attacks and warned they could be planning further strikes. Azahari and Noordin are also suspected of playing major roles in the October 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people and an August 2003 bomb blast at the Marriott hotel in Jakarta. Both attacks are blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah. Bachtiar said Azahari and Noordin had recruited other people from near Kurniawan's home in west Java for the embassy bombing. "Their ability to influence people is extraordinary. Noordin even managed to marry someone while on the run," Bachtiar said. More than 200,000 leaflets bearing the pictures of nine men wanted for terrorism including the embassy blast have been distributed by police, including the Malaysians and another key suspect Rois, alias Iwan Darmawan.]]></c>

At the local hospital, three wounded civilians were brought in, said Dr. Jabbar Sulak. The US military said there were few incidents over night and nothing that qualified as major fighting. US troops and Sadr's militia have battled in the district of 2.5 million people since August when fighting, which has since ended, erupted between the sides in the Shiite shrine city of Najaf.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Some five million Iraqi children are preparing to head back to classes on Saturday, with parents fearful over growing insecurity and officials concerned also about corruption in schools. The indiscriminate nature of the violence rocking Iraq was underlined on Thursday moments after Education Minister Sami al-Muzaffar announced the October 2 starting date of the new school year. Car bombs ripped through a Baghdad ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new water pumping station and killed 34 children. Questioned by AFP about the danger for children gathered in groups as shown by the gruesome attack, education ministry official Mohammed Hannun said: "Whatever the situation and whatever the circumstances, the children will go back to school on Saturday." "I have five children, aged between six and 14. I wanted to send them to school, but what shall I do now.," asked Ali al-Saidi, who lives in the sprawling Baghdad slum of Sadr City, rocked by almost daily violence between US troops and Shiite militiamen. Azhar al-Azzawi says her two nephews, aged eight and 11, are very excited about going back to school and seeing their friends again. "Their father doesn't want to disappoint them and will send them to school as planned but he will spend the entire day waiting in his car in front of the school," she explains. Muzaffar, while insisting that schools will resume even in the country's worst troublespots such as Fallujah or Sadr City, admits that the delay in the school year, which usually starts in mid-September, was "imposed by the situation". Classes resumed on September 20 in Kurdistan, a quasi-autonomous region in northern Iraq that has been relatively spared the relentless violence elsewhere. Muzaffar also acknowledges that "the parents' fear is legitimate." To try to reassure them, he said a joint committee operating with the interior ministry had been set up to coordinate security around schools. The minister also has to deal with corruption allegations against teachers, trying to bribe their way back into a job after falling victim to the hasty "de-Baathification" process launched after the fall of Saddam Hussein last year. "I am ready to pay 300,000 to 400,000 dinars (200 to 300 dollars) for my wife to be taken back in the teachers' corporation, where salaries have improved a lot," says Bassem, whose spouse used to teach English in a Baghdad school. He admits he will use the money to bribe an official from one of the capital's four education boards. "Corruption is rife and it is impossible for sacked teachers to reclaim a position without paying up," he says. In a bid to clean up the system, the ministry urged anybody to report bribery attempts. "We have already re-integrated 13,000 teachers. No need for bribes," Muzaffar says. "I am ready to Straits Times Index closed down 3.60 points at 1,981.14.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TAIPEI, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Around 150 Taiwanese activists demonstrated outside the representative offices of several European countries in Taipei Friday to urge the European Union not to lift a 15-year-old ban on arms sales to China. The activists, who favor Taiwan's full independence from China, said lifting the embargo imposed after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square would provide China with more weapons to threaten the island. "The arms embargo is a precious demonstration of the importance that EU countries attach to the universal values of human rights and peace," protest organizer Peter Wang said in a statement. "Lifting the ban would show that the EU is no longer so concerned about such principles," he said. "In addition to supporting and arming the infamous military and repressive regimes in North Korea, Burma and Cambodia, China is also threatening us here in Taiwan," Wang said. China views Taiwan as part of its territory despite their split in 1949 and has repeatedly threatened to invade should the island declare formal independence. Taiwan's defense ministry says China has 600 ballistic missiles aimed at the island and the number will surpass 800 before the end of 2006. "How can you justify providing China with weapons which will target our people." Wang asked. "Selling weapons to China is like rewarding its repression and belligerence," he said. At a protest outside the French Institute in Taiwan, France's de facto embassy here, a protestor wearing a mask of French President Jacques Chirac handed a mock missile made of paper to an activist posing as a soldier from China's People's Liberation Army. The activists also demonstrated outside the representative offices of Germany, Italy and England. Taiwan's foreign ministry has already urged EU not to drop the arms sanctions, warning that supplying China with advanced weaponry would help it prepare for a war in the Taiwan Strait and create a major security threat to the rest of the world. The United States, a key Taiwan ally, also wants the embargo to remain. China on Thursday renewed its call for the ban to be lifted, saying it was "a product of the Cold War".]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Four policemen, two soldiers and a civilian were killed in communist guerrilla attacks across the Philippines, officials said Friday. New People's Army (NPA) guerrillas ambushed the policemen in the center of Baganga town on the southern island of Mindanao, shooting two dead, provincial police chief Superintendent Catalino Cuy said. The rebels snatched two other policemen who were later found dead on the outskirts of the town a few hours after the early morning ambush, Cuy told reporters. Meanwhile, two soldiers were killed in a firefight with NPA rebels near the northern town of Baggao on Thursday, military spokesmen said. A civilian was killed and three soldiers wounded when NPA rebels ambushed a military convoy on the western island of Palawan on Wednesday. The attack occurred near the town of Taytay as the soldiers were delivering supplies to a military detachment. The lone civilian fatality had hitched a ride with one of the army trucks. Elsewhere, government troops shot dead a member of a breakaway communist guerrilla faction in a clash near the town of Arayat, north of Manila on Thursday. The 8,600-strong NPA and its political leadership, the Communist Party of the Philippines has been waging a 35-year Maoist armed campaign. The party announced in August that it was suspending peace talks with the government because of Manila's alleged failure to persuade Western countries to remove the rebels from their lists of international terrorists.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said Friday Tokyo's bid to downscale the US military on the southern island of Okinawa is being hampered because other mainland cities are reluctant to host US bases. "We must try to reduce Okinawa's burden while keeping US forces as a deterrent," Koizumi said in a speech to newspaper editors. "But we have seen little progress because once newspapers report the names of cities as potential candidates to host US bases, they quickly voice their opposition." Strategically located Okinawa, captured by US forces in 1945 and returned to Japan in 1972, accounts for less than one percent of Japan's land mass but hosts about 65 percent of the 40,500 US forces in the country. Tokyo and Washington have agreed to reduce the US military presence on Okinawa but no concrete plans have been worked out, partly due to the reluctance of other regions of Japan to assume part of the burden. Last month Koizumi raised the issue during a New York meeting with US President George W. Bush. A series of crimes committed by US soldiers, as well as disputes over the ownership and use of the land on which US military facilities sit, have made Okinawa residents reluctant hosts. Most recently, the crash of a US military helicopter on an Okinawan university campus in August revived anti-American sentiment on the Japanese island, drawing 30,000 protesters there. It was the largest anti-US military rally in Japan in nearly a decade.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[First Bush-Kerry debate, a tie: US press.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Both President George W. Bush and his Democratic rival John Kerry forcefully defended their positions on Iraq, and their first televised debate was enough of a tie to entice voters on to their next encounter, leading US dailies agreed Friday. "If Americans who tuned into last night's presidential debate were waiting for one of the candidates to catch the other in a fatal error, or leave him stammering, the event was obviously a draw," wrote The New York Times. The daily, however, gave Kerry points for looking presidential, keeping Bush on the defensive, arguing that Iraq had nothing to do with the war on terror and that Bush rushed into the war without an exit strategy. "It is the the strongest and most sensible critique of the administration's actions," the Times said, adding that Kerry had also "found an effective answer" to his dubious vote for 87 billion dollars in war appropriations by comparing his mistake to Bush's mistake in going to war. Despite the controlled environment of the debate, the Times concluded, the discussion "seemed like a breath of fresh air" to a campaign starved for real substance. USA Today leaves the verdictard." While a majority of Americans feel the Iraq war was not worth fighting, said the daily citing recent polls, "more people trusted Bush over Kerry to develop a plan for succeeding there. "Kerry doesn't have a magic wand to undo Bush's mistakes, and it must be frustrating to him that many voters feel as if they are stuck with the incumbent," added the Los Angeles Times editorial. "Mr Bush stoutly defended his decision to go to war and its results; Mr Kerry forcefully criticized that decision and the war's management. " said The Washington Post. Kerry had "a more complicated position to defend, and it showed at times," said the daily. "He called the war a mistake and a diversion, but later said that American soldiers were not dying for a mistake." Bush, on the other hand, was "skillfull and relentless in underlining these 'mixed messages' and in outlining his goal that success in Iraq and on other fronts is equally vital to US security." However, the Post added, "Bush's clarity in defining goals was not matched with candor about conditions on the ground in Iraq," and Kerry was effective in stressing how the nuclear threat from North Korea and Iran has increased under Bush's watch. "Both performed credibly enough to keep voters tuned in for the next debate," concluded the Post.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[European stock markets climbed in early deals on Friday, shaking off a mixed overnight showing on Wall Street, as banking stocks gave a pre-weekend boost to London share prices. The London FTSE 100 index gained 0.69 percent to 4,602.20 points, the Frankfurt DAX rose 0.54 percent to 3,914.08 points and the Paris CAC 40 climbed 0.71 percent to 3,666.45. The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading eurozone shares advanced 0.53 percent to 2,740.78 points. The euro stood at 1.2420 dollars. US shares closed mixed Thursday as the share price of Merck plunged to an eight-year low after the US pharmaceutical giant announced a global withdrawal of its blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx, citing possible stroke and cardiovascular risks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.55 percent to 10,080.27 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite managed a late comeback, rising 0.15 percent to 1,896.84. The Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index edged down 0.02 percent to 1,114.58 points. In Asia, Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei-225 index closed 1.49 percent higher at 10,985.17 points on Friday after the key Tankan survey showed continued improvement in business sentiment in the September quarter, dealers said. In London, an upbeat trading update from British home loan provider Northern Rock lifted the financial sector and helped push the FTSE 100 index above the 4,600-points level for the first time in more than a week, dealers said. Northern Rock rose 1.97 percent to 724 pence after forecasting full-year profits at least in line with consensus. The positive outlook lifted sector peers, with HBOS winning 0.87 percent to 752.5 pence and Abbey National 0.36 percent higher at 562 pence. British Energy, the troubled nuclear group, was unchanged at 14.25 pence after posting a first-quarter net loss after exceptional items of 115 million pounds (168 million euros, 208 million dollars).]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush, Kerry, clash on Iraq in presidential debate.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CORAL GABLES, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Senator John Kerry charged late Thursday that President George W. Bush committed "a colossal error" by invading Iraq, as they clashed in a high-stakes debate that may decide their battle for the White House. As tens of millions of Americans watched the televised confrontation, Bush countered that Kerry was undermining US credibility in the war on terrorism with "mixed messages" about whether toppling Saddam Hussein was worth the cost. "What message does that send our troops. What message does that send to our allies. What message does that send the Iraqis." the Republican incumbent asked. "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein." Iraq and national security dominated as the two candidates battled over how to stabilize that war-torn country, where more than 1,000 US soldiers have died amid deadly chaos that shows no sign of ebbing. Kerry went into the debate needing a strong performance and some instant polls straight after said he had beaten the president. A Gallup poll for CNN gave Kerry a 46 percent to 37 percent win over the president. Leading US dailies on Friday agreed that the debate was a tie. "If Americans who tuned into last night's presidential debate were waiting for one of the candidates to catch the other in a fatal error, or leave him stammering, the event was obviously a draw," wrote The New York Times. Kerry threw the first punch in the political prizefight by confidently declaring "I can do a better job" on Iraq and on averting another terrorist attack like the September 11, 2001 strikes. He also charged Bush unecessarily diverted resources from the hunt for Osama bin Laden to the war in Iraq, saying: "This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the president." "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein," said the president, who painted his rival as fickle on crucial national security issues, noting he voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002 but against war funding in 2003. "We're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens," said Bush. "You cannot lead if you send mixed messages." "I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat. There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way. And the president chose the wrong way," countered the Massachusetts senator. Kerry has accused Bush of fracturing alliances and damaging US global standing in the rush to war; Bush has charged Kerry is more worried about worldwide popularity than protecting the United States. Before the confrontation, the Republican and Democratic rivals shook hands and exchanged tense smiles before taking cover behind matching s readers with what it believes is the real conundrum: "Kerry won Thursday night's debate on foreign policy by a comfortable margin, but Americans may yet decide that President Bush is better able to clean up the mess he created in Iraq." The first of the three debates went ahead amid mounting chaos in Iraq. At least 49 people were killed there, dozens of them children, in three nearly simultaneous car bomb attacks Thursday. US and Iraqi forces poured into central Samarra early Friday to seize the troublespot's government building and police stations in an attempt to beat back the insurgency, the US military said. "This president, I don't know if he sees what's really happened on there. But it's getting worse by the day," said Kerry. "If we lose our will, we lose. But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy," said Bush. The candidates' different styles were on display early. Kerry sought to back up policy proposals with statistics and detaised faceoffs was scheduled after weeks of negotiations on the most minute aspects of the event, including the height of podiums, the temperature of the room and allowable camera angles. Despite the controlled environment, the New York Times said, the discussion "seemed like a breath of fresh air" to a campaign starved for real substance.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Banks targeted by damages and interest claims by food group Parmalat have approached the company to seek an agreed settlement, the newspaper La Repubblica reported on Friday. The approaches were at the stage of preliminary contacts, the report said, adding that until now the company, bankrupted at the end of last year and now being restructured, had considered amounts proffered by the banks to be inadequate. Each bank was acting alone but nearly all of them had tried to establish contact with the management of Parmalat, the report said. Parmalat has laid cases in Italy against several big international banks, claiming heavy damages with interest, alleging that the banks had acted improperly as the company lurched towards collapse because about 14 billion euros (17.36 billion dollars) was missing from its accounts. In particular, Parmalat is claiming 10 billion dollars (8.06 billion euros) from US bank Citigroup, 290 million euros from Swiss bank UBS and 284 million euros from another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse. Meanwhile the head of Citigroup, Charles Prince, told the Financial Times that he rejected the allegations, saying that his bank had been misled.]]></c>

One of the men was named as 35-year-old Atef Sabbah. The other man's identity was not immediately known. Another militant and three civilians were wounded in the same incident outside a mosque in the Tal Al-Zaatar neighborhood of the camp, medics said. An army spokeswoman confirmed the raid, saying that it had targeted a group of militants who were about to fire a Qassam rocket -- named after Hamas' military wing, the Ezzedin Al-Qassam Brigades. Palestinian witnesses said the attack was carried out by an unmanned plane, or drone, while others earlier said that a tank had fired a shell at the militants. Medics said a helicopter missile had also struck another target in Jabaliya, wounding at least one person. The Israeli army launched a massive offensive on the northern Gaza Strip three days ago in a bid to prevent rocket fire. The latest casualties lifted the toll since Tuesday night to 40 Palestinians and three Israelis killed, two of them chilren who died in a Qassam attack. And they brought the overall death toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising four years ago to 4,395, including 3,371 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count.]]></c>

The Swiss top seed, already assured of this season's world number one ranking, will be playing in his tenth semi of the season on Saturday at the Impact arena. He will face the winner from Thai hero Paradorn Srichaphan, seeded fourth, and Dutchman Dennis van Scheppingen. Federer, now 67-6 this season and holder of three of the four Grand Slams, said he was now able to begin thinking about achieving just a bit more in 2004. "There are still two matches to go, but I can start dreaming about a tenth trophy this season," said the Swiss, who fired over 14 aces including one on match point agianst his Swedish opponent. "Soderling gave me a tough match, he served for the first set (leading 5-4) but I broke him. I was glad to get back into it. "In the second it was a real boost for me to win. Ten titles this season would be nice. To do it here this week would be fantastic." Federer won his previous meeting with the eighth-seeded Soderling in late July in the second round at Toronto en route to that title. Soderling, 20, stands a dismal 1-6 lifetime against Top 10 opponents, with his only win coming over Rainer Schuettler in the first round of this year's Australian Open. Federer won the opening set in a tie-breaker producing two of his aces along the way. In the second, the pair exchanged breaks from the third through fifth game with the Swiss emerging with the lead, 3-2. Federer had to save two break points, but ended the sixth game with an ace for 4-2. He then took the victory after one hour, 22 minutes. In other quarter-final contests, second seed Andy Roddick was playing Swede Thomas Johansson while China Open winner Marat Safin faced Brazil's Flavio Saretta.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[South Africa's Anglo Platinum company, the world's leading producer of platinum, said Friday that two of its mines were hit by a miners' strike but insisted the work stoppage has not affected production. Workers at Anglo Platinum, which operates six mines in South Africa, began walking off the job overnight, joining some 17,000 fellow unionists who launched a strike on Wednesday at a separate mining group, Impala Platinum. But Anglo Platinum said the strike only affected two mines and that fewer than 10,000 of its 30,000 employees were taking part. "There isn't any effect on production from the strike because most of our employees are working," said Anglo Platinum's corporate spokesman Mike Mtakati. "So far, everything seemses two mines in Rustenburg, some 100 kilometers (565 miles) northwest of Johannesburg, said it was losing an estimated 28 million rand (4.3 million dollars/3.5 million euros) per day, because of the work stoppage. Impala Platinum is applying the 'no work, no pay' rule for striking miners. South Africa is the world's largest producer of platinum, accounting for some 4.7 million ounces, or 70 percent, of the world's total output.

		<c><![CDATA[Zimbabwe's Information Minister Jonathan Moyo has warned journalists working for state media against working for foreign news organisations. Moyo was quoted Friday by the state daily The Herald as saying that "the greatest tragedy facing the Zimbabwean media was the presence of media practitioners who were willing to be used by colonial forces to destroy the country by reporting falsehoods in foreign newspapers and radio stations." "Do not tell the story as if you are a British or American. Tell the story with passion," said Moyo during the launch of a provincial paper published by the state news agency NEW ZIANA. Moyo, whose office has closed down several papers this year, said Zimbabwean newspapers needed to "reflect pan-Africanism and should desist from carrying sponsored political stories." The Herald this year dismissed three journalists who were stringing for Voice of America (VOA), the broadcast network funded by the US government. Days after their dismissal, the state media commission which authorises accreditation for journalists and licenses for media houses, said the reporters who worked for VOA posed a security threat to the country. "The. serious problem is that of national interest and national security," the media commission said, because "the Voice of America is an arm of the US State Department which is on record as seeking to overthrow the government of Zimbabwe through unconstitutional means."]]></c>

Australian David Norman and Italian Manual Musu both claimed to be the biological father of the girl, Manny, whose Indonesian mother was one of at least nine people killed in the suicide bombing. After three weeks of fighting for custody of the girl, the rival dads issued a joint statement Friday saying Manny would live with Musu in Italy. "We have both come to the decision that Manny will be returning to Italy to resume her normal life," Musu said in the statement. "We both feel this is in the best interest of Manny's recovery." Despite having battled to bring Manny to Australia, Norman said he had finally realised she would be better off with Musu and his family. "Manny will be returning to Italy with Manuel to resume her normal life, as I feel this will help with her recovery from her injuries and the loss of her mother," he said. "I have come to respect and admire Manuel -- with the way he has handled this difficult situation, he has shown me that he is a devoted and loving father," he said. "As much as I would dearly love to rear Manny and see her grow up on a daily basis, I am willing, in her best interests, to let her return to the life she had in Italy." The girl has Australian, Italian and Indonesian citizenship and had been going to the embassy in Jakarta to collect her first Australian passport when the suicide bomber struck. Manny, whose real name is Elisabeth Manuela Musu, has been recovering in a Singapore hospital from critical injuries suffered in the bombing. A head injury is expected to leave her with some brain damage. While both men claimed paternity, the Australian government said a DNA test done before Manny was granted Australian citizenship proved Norman was her biological father. The Musu family countered with claims that the DNA documents proving paternity were forged. Norman said money he had received from a media interview, as well as donated funds, would be set up in a trust fund for Manny to help with her future needs.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Malaysian share prices closed 0.47 percent higher Friday on foreign institutional investor support, with heavyweight blue chips leading the gains, dealers said. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index rose 3.97 points at 853.93. Volume was 342 million shares worth 767.2 million ringgit (202 million dollars) with 383 gainers against 276 losers. Dealers said speculative stocks as well as oil- and gas-related shares also attracted interest, with most of them posting good gains. "The market was distinctly more active with buying centered mainly on liquid blue chips and speculative stocks," a local brokerage dealer said. One analyst at a local research house said there was also increased rotational trading on speculative stocks as a result of follow-through on a recent technical rebound. Among blue chips, Telekom Malaysia was up 0.30 at 11.50 ringgit on the back of institutional interest fueled by a better earnings outlook. Casino operator Genting rose 0.30 to 17.20 but power firm Tenaga Nasional and top bank Malayan Banking were unchanged at 11.00 each. Poultry stocks also attracted interest after the government raised the ceiling for chicken prices by 0.50-0.60 ringgit to help the industry recover after the recent bird flu outbreaks. Leong Hup Holdings added 0.02 to 1.06, TPC climbed 0.01 to 0.445, QSR Brands gained 0.07 to 1.94 and Sin Heng Chan firmed 0.03 to 1.02.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Russia has played one of its last political trump cards -- the Kyoto Protocol -- in hopes of winning European support for its membership in the World Trade Organization, the Russian press said Friday. Most Moscow newspapers pointed out that the cabinet's decision Thursday to endorse the global warming treaty was a political decision reached quickly at the highest levels of the Kremlin, perhaps by President Vladimir Putin himself. Several top ministers who for years argued against the treaty's merits spoke Thursday in favor of Kyoto, which should be ratified by Russia within three months by a vote in the pro-Kremlin lower house of parliament. "Russia has to yield European pressure. We have not yet entered the World Trade Organization, and the recent reforms (of Putin) to reinforce his powers have prompted a negative reaction in the West," Vremya Novostei said. Russia's backing of the Kyoto Protocol displays Moscow's will to "be a loyal and civilized political player on the international scene," the liberal daily said. The respected Izvestia daily said Russia, which holds the swing vote on the treaty's implementation after the pact's rejection by the United States, billed the cabinet's move as "political ecology." And even the state-run Rossiyskaya Gazeta, which cautiously treads the official line, said Russia had an interest in "going a step toward the EU". Moscow has been hedging its bets for years as its weighs its own economic policies against the broader diplomatic benefits of allying itself closer to the United States -- the world's biggest polluter -- or its largest trading partner Europe. Countries which are not signatories to Kyoto -- like the United States -- will not be bound by the pact even if it enters into force.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices fell on Friday as Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that his government would not tolerate any "undue militancy" in the oil-rich Niger Delta. The price of light sweet crude for November delivery fell 32 cents to 49.32 dollars a barrel in pre-opening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November lost 38 cents to 46.00 dollars in early deals. Oil prices hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in after-hours New York deals on Monday and 46.80 dollars in London on Tuesday amid unrest in Nigeria. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," Obasanjo said in a televised speech on Friday to mark 44 years of Nigerian independence from Britain. Obasanjo said his government was continuing to hold talks with rebel leaders from the Niger Delta and assured that a "rapprochement" was taking place. Rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari began talks on Wednesday with officials in Obasanjo's government ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to pull out of Niger Delta. Crude oil exports account for 95 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income and about 65 percent of budgetary revenues. "Nigerian oil is seen as crucial (by markets) because it is light, sweet oil, favoured by refineries and currently in short supply while there is a glut of sour crude," analysts at the Sucden brokerage firm said. Oil prices have endured a roller coaster week, rising sharply at the start before falling Wednesday and creeping back up a day later. Prices fell mid-week as peace talks began in Nigeria and US crude oil inventories showed a surprise increase a week after tumbling to their lowest levels since February. The Department of Energy said crude oil reserves rose 3.4 million barrels in the week to September 24 to 272.9 million barrels, a week after a spectacular drop of 9.1 million barrels due to Hurricane Ivan.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Australia's new national football league was in a sound position despite the surprise withdrawal of Adelaide United, the Australian Soccer Association (ASA) said on Friday. ASA head of operations Matt Carroll dismissed reports that next year's proposed eight-team league was floundering before it even kicked off. "Certainly, the Adelaide thing was a surprise," Carroll told reporters on Friday. "(But) the league isn't sitting on any precipice -- in fact, it's in a very sound position. "We've already announced the television broadcaster, we're ready in the next two weeks to name the naming rights sponsor. "So, commercially, from the competition's point of view, it's better than ever before." Adelaide United, one of best supported clubs in the previous national league, was expected to gain a spot in next year's eight-team competition as the only bidder from its region. But while the decision by Adelaide United's backer, the Pickard Group, to quit was a surprise, Carroll said the ASA had other options. "There is the potential to have two teams in another city, and there is another couple of cities which have expressed interest," he said. Two teams could now get the nod in either Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane, but Carroll said the ASA's preference was to find another interested party in Adelaide.]]></c>

Federer won the opening set in a tie-breaker producing two of his aces along the way. In the second, the pair exchanged breaks from the third through fifth game with the Swiss emerging with the lead, 3-2. Federer had to save two break points, but ended the sixth game with an ace for 4-2. He then took the victory after one hour, 22 minutes.

		<d><![CDATA[DAMASCUS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[France remained cautious Friday amid hopes that two French journalists kidnapped six weeks ago in Iraq could be freed soon following a flurry of activity aimed at winning their release. A senior French foreign ministry official arrived in Jordan early Friday as part of mounting efforts to secure the release of Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France Internationale. Jean-Pierre Lafon will "work on the fate of the hostages," Ambassador Jean Michel Caza said, without providing details. "He is here, he is working and we do not know how long he will be here." France has remained cautious over the two men's fate after hopes earlier this month that their release was imminent came to nothing. The foreign ministry said in a statement that Foreign Minister Michel Barnier had sent Lafon to Amman "as part of ongoing efforts to secure the release of the hostages." That came as a French lawmaker expressed optimism about the release of the two hostages as he travelled to the Middle East to help secure their freedom. "Things are moving, but so long has we haven't seen anything concrete, we will not be making any declarations," said Didier Julia, a member of President Jacques Chirac's UMP party and vice-president of the Iraqi-French Friendship Group. "I never promised anything without being sure of being able to deliver. or else why do you think I bothered." he told an AFP correspondent as he arrived in the Syrian capital Damascus. Chesnot, 37, Malbrunot 41, and their Syrian driver Mohammed al-Jundi were abducted on August 20 south of Baghdad by a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq. Julia, whose mission has not been officially sanctioned by Paris, told Le Parisien newspaper on Thursday that he met members of the Islamic Army in Iraq earlier this month in Jordan. "They told me they were having big difficulties with the French authorities. So I decided to send in a mission," he said. Julia's aides in Damascus said the two journalists were in "safe hands" but their release depended on the security situation around the rebel-held town of Fallujah, west of Baghdad. "Their liberation is assured, but their exit is being blocked by American bombardment in the Fallujah area. We are trying to ensure safe passage for the intermediary who is to go and bring the journalists out to Baghdad before they leave Iraq for France," Philippe Evano told AFP. "The two journalists were kidnapped by highway bandits and then were handed over to the resistance who now want to set them free, but only if they can do it in total security," Evano said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TAIPEI, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Taiwan share prices are expected to continue firmer next week, building on a strong finish Friday as investors returned in force to the financials and old-economy stocks, dealers said. They said the market, which rose 1.7 percent Friday to within sight of the key 6,000 points level, should be able to breach that if there is no bad news on the oil price front. Financials did surprisingly well on Friday after a larger-than-expected hike of 25 basis points in interest rates, which investors believe will boost their margins. At the same time, old-economy stocks -- steel, cement, paper, construction -- did well on the view that these companies, mostly large conglomerates, will be able to use their size and diversity to secure financing at still favourable rates. The key electronics sector, however, is likely to remain under pressure on concerns over the outlook for flat panel makers as more capacity comes on stream and prices fall. For the week to October 1, the Taiwan weighted index closed up 53.14 points or 0.9 percent at 5,945.35. Average daily turnover for the holiday-shortened week was 77.61 billion Taiwan dollars (2.28 billion US), down from last week's 82.91 billion dollars. "Financial stocks will benefit most in the week ahead due to the hike in the discount rate," said Wang Chao-li, a manager at Polaris-Protime Securities Investment Advisory Co. Wang said higher product prices should benefit the petrochemicals while select old-economy stocks such as in steel and shipping will continue attracting investors. The market stands a good chance of breaking the 6,000-points level next week, with investors relieved China has not so far made upped the rhetoric further on reunification during the national day holidays, he added.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISLAMABAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A powerful bomb ripped through a Shiite Muslim mosque in the eastern Pakistani city of Sialkot during Friday prayers, killing at least 15 people and leaving dozens injured, police said. Hundreds of worshippers were packed into the Mistri Abdullah Imambargah mosque in the city center when a huge explosion tore through the building, police spokesman Mohammad Ihsanullah told AFP. "The explosion killed at least 15 people and dozens were injured. The bomb left a nearly two feet deep crater and caused extensive damage to the premises," Ihsanullah said. Witnesses said body parts and blood were spattered across the interior of the mosque, while ambulances rushed the seriously-injured to the city's Allama Iqbal Town hospital. Angry demonstrators clashed with police outside the mosque after the explosion. Police said bomb disposal officers were inspecting the site and that security had been tightened around the mosque area. The attack came five days after Pakistani security forces killed the country's most wanted Sunni Muslim extremist, Al-Qaeda operative Amjad Farooqi, in a shootout in the south of the country. Farooqi, the alleged mastermind of several attempts to kill President Pervez Musharraf, was an activist in the Harkatul Jihad-e-Islam, a Sunni Muslim militant group blamed for the 2002 murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl. Fanatics from Pakistan's Sunni Muslim majority and Shiite minority, most of whom co-habit peacefully, have been killing each other since the 1980s. The conflict has so far cost over 4,000 lives. Pakistani officials say Osama bin Laden's Sunni fundamentalist Al-Qaeda network has been increasingly linking up with local Pakistani groups to launch terrorist attacks and fuel the sectarian conflict with the Shiite community. The hardline and banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was blamed for two bomb attacks on Shiite moques in the southern port of Karachi in May and June which left 45 people dead. The latest bombing also comes as the Pakistani security forces are locked in a fierce battle against Al-Qaeda which has seen a number of important arrests since July. The most notable were Pakistani computer expert Naeem Noor Khan and Tanzanian Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, who has been indicted by a US court for his role in the twin bombing of American embassies in East Africa in 1998. The crackdown followed a major counter-terrorism operation in Pakistan's rugged and autonomous tribal territory, along the border with Afghanistan, in March and June. The military says it has dismantled major hideouts of Al-Qaeda militants in the tribal region of South Waziristan. The continuing operations are said to have killed over 150 foreign and local militants. Musharraf, who threw his support behind the US "war on terror" after the September 11 attacks, said this month he was making significant inroads into breaking the Al-Qaeda network and that over 600 Al-Qaeda suspects had been detained.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indonesia's consumer price index rose 6.27 percent year-on-year in September and was up 0.02 percent from August, with lower food prices keeping prices in check, the government said Friday. In other figures, the trade surplus climbed to 1.89 billion dollars in August from 1.57 billion dollars in July due to weaker imports. Central Bureau of Statistics head Choiril Maksum that exports rose to 5.91 billion dollars in August from 5.68 billion dollars in July while imports dropped to 4.02 billion dollars from 4.11 billion dollars. Maksum said said non-oil and gas exports amounted to 4.60 billion dollars, up from 4.45 billion dollars in July, while non-oil and gas imports fell to 2.99 billion dollars from from 3.1 billion dollars. Despite being an OPEC member, Indonesia has been facing difficulties boosting production levels of its creaking oil industry. It currently produces 1.072 million barrels per day, below initial budget forecasts of 1.15 million. For the eight months to August, the trade surplus fell to 13.99 billion dollars from 19.43 billion dollars a year ago. Maksum said a year-on-year inflation increase of 6.27 percent was in line with the 6.10-6.75 percent forecast by analysts. "Only food prices registered a fall during the month," he said, noting good supplies of rice, which carries the largest weighting on the Consumer Price Index. Food prices fell 1.36 percent while processed food, beverage and tobacco were up 0.18 percent. Education, recreation and sports prices were up 2.02 percent in September, he said. Housing, water, electricity, gas and fuel increased 0.45 percent, clothing was up 0.30 percent and healthcare 0.16 percent higher, while transportation, communication and financial services were up 0.04 percent. In August the index rose 6.67 percent year-on-year and 0.09 percent month-on-month as a drop in food prices softened the impact from higher education-related spending at the start of the school-year.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KABUL, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Fiercely independent Pashtun tribes in troubled southeastern Afghanistan will provide thousands of armed volunteers to help secure the Afghan presidential elections next week, officials said Friday. The volunteers will be men known as Arbakies, who assist tribal elders in the southern provinces of Paktia, Paktika and Khost with enforcing decisions when they are not tilling their fields and doing ordinary jobs. "Around 1,500 Arbakies are going to support Afghan national police and army in providing security for the elections in Paktia province," provincial governor Assadullah Wafa told AFP. In neighbouring Khost province some 1,800 Arbakies will help secure electoral sites, said Pir Saeed Shah, director of the province's joint electoral commission. Rights organisations have expressed concern ahead of the October 9 elections that armed militias under the control of regional warlords will influence the way people vote. The Arbakies are not militiamen, being part-time tribal enforcers. But in Khost last week, one Pashtun tribe broadcast a radio message ordering all tribe members to vote for US-backed incumbent President Hamid Karzai. If they did not, the broadcast said, their houses would be burnt down. Afghanistan is a country which has handled most of its national issues through Jirgas, or tribal councils, which command far more authority in the Pashtun tribal belt than national government officials. Whenever there are security threats in southeastern Paktia, Paktika and Khost provinces, which have been hit by a Taliban-led insurgency, the tribal volunteers are called in to defend the interests of their tribe. Taliban militants who were ousted by a US-led military campaign in late 2001 have vowed to disrupt the vote, the first of its kind in the Afghanistan's history. Providing security has been a headache for election officials, especially in the south where President Hamid Karzai must draw support from the same communities which have backed the Taliban in the past. More than 18,000 US-led troops will provide quick-reaction forces for voting problems in the south and southeast, with over 8,000 NATO-led peacekeeping troops in Kabul and the northern provinces. Most of the security, however, will be provided by a poorly trained Afghan police force and the fledgling Afghan army.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[VERONA, Italy, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Australian men's team had eight of their bikes stolen at the world cycling road race championships here, a team spokeman said on Friday. The thieves struck at the team's hotel in the town of Lazise, on the shores of Lake Garda just outside of Verona. Among the victims were three of the men's senior team - Matthew White, Matt Hayman and Cadel Evans - who are among the 11-man team bidding for victory in the men's road race on Sunday. Australia's recent world time trial champion Michael Rogers also had his training road bike stolen. With two days to go until the 265.km road race, the blue ribband event here where Australian Stuart O'Grady could realistically end a great season on the championship podium, replacement bikes will be provided in time. Other riders, however, have not been so lucky. Peter Dawson, who on Thursday was named as a member of the professional Italian team Liquigas, also had his bike stolen only hours ahead of the men's under-23 road race. Dawson was to ride on a spare bike. Three other junior riders, due to compete in their road race on Saturday, will also ride on spare bikes after their bikes were stolen. A spokesperson for the team said that the team's mechanics had discovered the theft in the early hours of Friday morning. The thieves are thought to have smashed the lock of a door at street level which led to the garage where all the team's equipment is being stored.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Supporters of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic gave a hostile welcome Friday to chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte as she visited Belgrade to attend a conference, witnesses said. Riot police were on hand as a group of around 30 protesters gathered outside a Belgrade hotel where Del Ponte attended the start of a conference on war crimes. The protesters waved banners in support of Milosevic, who is on trial at the UN war crimes court at The Hague for his role in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. It is the prosecutor's first visit to Belgrade since October, when she delivered indictments against four Serbian generals charged with war crimes allegedly committed during the 1998-99 Kosovo conflict. She is due to meet Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica during a return visit on Monday, when she is expected to pressure Belgrade to arrest fugitives such as former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic. Her trip comes a day after US Undersecretary of Se indictment, but he was not arrested, a court spokeswoman told AFP. Spokeswoman Sonja Prostran said the former deputy interior minister was "informed about the charges and a demand on his transfer (to The Hague)." Lukic was the chief of Serbian police forces in Kosovo under the overall command of then-Yugoslav president Milosevic. The other three generals have failed to appear in court.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic powered into the semifinals of 380,000-dollar ATP Shanghai Open Friday, downing Jan-Michael Gambill 6-3, 6-3 and setting up a clash against Guillermo Canas of Argentina. Top seed Novak easily overpowered Gambill as his American opponent time and again threw away certain winners and looked unsteady from start to finish. "I am happy with my game," Novak said. "I just came from the Davis Cup and I won both matches there. Everything is going very well." Gambill was looking for his first semi-final appearance of the year but unforced errors and the strength of the baselining Czech proved his undoing. Novak began the first set with a break and was quickly up 3-O as he outhit and even outran the 27-year-old from Washington state. It was more of the same in the second set as the 29-year-old Prague native, who has struggled this year, showed resurgent form that could see him avenge last year's loss in the Shanghai final. On Saturday, the world number 34 faces Canas, who although seeded third is the tournament's other top seed after Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero pulled out earlier in the week due to a wrist injury. Last year's winner, Australian Mark Philippoussis, crashed out in the first round. Canas, who missed most of last season with a wrist injury, needed only two sets Friday to oust seventh-seeded Brazilian Ricardo Mello and book a spot in the semi-finals. "I think I played my best game of the tournament," said Canas. Canas had an easy time against Mello, winning 6-3, 6-4 even though the Brazilian has been playing some of the hottest tennis of the tour. Mello, who climbed to world number 88 following his first ATP title at Delray Beach in the United States two weeks ago and has triumphed in his last 21 of 24 matches, had no answer to a confident Canas. The Argentinean, who has grown stronger with each match and is currently ranked 24 in the world, is looking for his sixth career ATP title after capturing back-to-back tournaments at Umag and Stuttgart in July. He has won 16 of his last 17 matches. His only loss was at the hands of 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JERUSALEM, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Israeli army will intensify its operation in the northern Gaza Strip if militant rocket attacks continue, a senior government official said Friday. "If rocket fire continues, we will broaden our operation on the ground and be more aggressive," he said on condition of anonymity. He said the massive offensive, codenamed "Day of Penitence" and unanimously approved by the security cabinet, would be limited only "if it quickly fulfills its objective to completely stop rocket fire" on southern Israel. Two Israeli toddlers were killed in a Wednesday rocket attack on Sderot, just across the Gaza border. At least 44 Palestinians and five Israelis have been killed since tanks first rolled into the northern Gaza Strip three days ago. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to dismantle all 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip next year will not happen "under fire," the official warned. "There must be a period of calm and stability in the Gaza Strip before it (the evacuation) goes ahead," he said. "We're working on it." He said that the means put at the army's disposal in the current raid were "consequent" but "not yet comparable to those used during Operation Defensive Shield," in the spring 2002, when troops reoccupied most of the West Bank in a massive search and arrest operation after a spate of suicide bombings. He said the army was about to take control of a six-kilometer (four-mile) deep buffer zone in the northern Gaza Strip to "keep militants firing rockets away from Sderot." The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is "increasingly resembling a guerrilla" war, he said, acknowledging that "some of its aspects bring to mind the situation that prevailed in Lebanon," whose southern tip was occupied by Israel for 18 years until 2000.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Residents of a Baghdad working class neighbourhood mourned on Friday for their "little martyrs", after the opening of a US-funded project to improve their lives turned into an inferno, killing at least 34 children. "The children that died are martyrs and they are going straight to paradise," said an articulate Hamza Ahmed, 15, his eyes filling with tears. "I want the whole world to hear our cry." T-shirts of those killed in Thursday's triple car bombings hang on the fence outside the bombed out sewerage treatment plant in Al-Amel (worker) neigbourhood in southwestern part of the city. Two car bombs had blasted into a group of local officials, contractors and US soldiers gathered for a ribbon-cutting ceremony in front of the plant. A third car bomb exploded a few hundred meters away. Most of those killed were children who had gathered to collect candy and sweets from US soldiers at the ceremony. On Friday morning, pink and golden sweet wrappers and small slippers still littered the sidewalk in front of the plant. Shredded flesh was splattered on the outside walls of the plant, and the chassis and remains of one of the vehicles lay inside the facility, where the explosion had hurled them. And 24 hours after the blasts, gruesome discoveries were still being made. "Oh my God." screamed Faiza Abdul Rudha, a caretaker at the plant, as one of her colleagues pulled a child's severed head and leg from inside one of the old machines in the facility. The discovery brought to at least 43 the number of people killed in the attacks. As her colleague laid the remains on the floor and covered them with newspaper, Abdul Rudha turned her head away and broke into tears. Thursday's ceremony had been to mark the handing over of the refurbished plant to local municipal officials by a company contracted by the US military's civil affairs unit. The plant had been heavily looted and destroyed in the wave of chaos that spread through Baghdad after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003. "We are back to square one," Abdul Rudha said, wringing her hands in despair. She said she abandoned the plant after the blasts to rush her wounded husband to hospital. "We miraculously made it through the back streets as the Americans ringed the area after the attacks to evacuate their wounded," said Abdul Rudha. On the streets of Al-Amel on Friday people vented their anger and grief against both the Americans, who said 10 of their soldiers were wounded, and the insurgency. Many people said the US military should have stayed away from the ceremony and left it to Iraqis instead. "They wanted to create good public relations for themselves and we ultimately paid the price," said Abdul Karim Hamid, 42, who owns a shop in the area.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The European Central Bank and the municipal authorities of Frankfurt, where the guardian of the euro is based, are at loggerheads over the design of the bank's new headquarters, local politicians revealed on Friday. The ECB, currently headquartered in the "Eurotower" skyscraper in the city centre, is planning to move to a new building at the site of a now disused markets area in the east of Frankfurt. Three design projects have been short-listed, with the ECB's policy-making governing council to pick the final winner on November 18. The problem is that the bank prefers a design proposed by Berlin-based architects ASP Schweger, while the city authorities favour a project by Austrian architects Coop Himmelb(l)au, which won the first prize in the public architectural competition fofor the immediate "Ostend" area of the city. "Such an unshapely construction is unacceptable," SPD politician Oesterling said. By contrast, the design by Vienna-based Coop Himmelb(l)au would consitute "a good basis" for the ECB's new headquarters and the city planners lauded the project as "striking in terms of architecture and urban development". The ECB for its part was conciliatory, with a spokesman saying that the bank "will not decide anything without the agreement of the city. We're looking for a consensus."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[When US President George W. Bush took office in 2001 he backed away from a policy of direct engagement with North Korea as followed by the previous administration under Bill Clinton. Nearly four years after he reversed the policy of bilateral talks, the issue of how to handle relations with the Stalinist regime has entered the presidential race between Bush and his Democratic challenger John Kerry. In 2000, Clinton sent his secretary of state Madeleine Albright to Pyongyang for talks with leader Kim Jong-Il as the United States and North Korea rapidly converged along a path of reconciliation. After entering office the following year, Bush reversed the policy and ordered a full review of US-North Korean ties, now deadlocked over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Bush has insisted that so-called six-nation talks are the only way to resolve the standoff, and Thursday referred to those involved in the talks with the North as a "coalition," suggesting solidarity with the United States. But China, Russia, Japan, and South Korea have all urged Washington to come to the table for direct talks with North Korea at different times in the past and governments in North East Asia consider that bilateral talks must ultimately take place if the standoff is ever to be resolved. Bush reserved his sharpest public criticism of the Stalinist state for his State of the Union address of 2002, when he accused Pyongyang of weapons proliferation and included North Korea in his 'axis of evil' along with Iran and Iraq. Hawks in Washington applauded Bush's hard-line on Pyongyang and hoped that it would spell an end to the Agreed Framework, a 1994 accord signed between the Clinton administration and the communist leaders in Pyongyang that ended a previous nuclear standoff. Under that accord Pyongyang undertook in direct talks with Washington to freeze its plutonium-based nuclear weapons programme in return for fuel aid and the construction of two light-water reactors by a US-led consortium. Republican hawks have always considered that North Korea was awarded too much for too little under the agreement that unravelled in October 2002, when Washington accused Pyongyang of pursuing a separate nuclear weapons programme based on highly enriched uranium -- sparking a second nuclear standoff that remains unresolved. Accusing Pyongyang of breaking its word in one-on-one negotiations 10 years ago, Bush has steadfastly refused to go one-on-one with the Pyongyang regime to end the latest standoff, instead relying on the six-nation talks. In so doing he upset his own Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had initially said the reconciliation process inherited from Clinton would continue, according to Kerry, in a televised debate with Bush on Thursday. Bush also sent then-South Korean president Kim Dae-Jung home from a state visit to Washington "bewildered and embarrassed" after speaking out against Seoul's policy of reconciliation with North Korea, Kerry said. He accused Bush of losing control of the North Korean nuclear standoff and making the world a much more dangerous place in the process by refusing to engage in one-on-one dialogue with the Stalinist state. Bush argued in the debate that only through the six-way talks involving regional powers could Pyongyang be forced to comply with its commitments to disarm, while Kerry said the US had lost its way on North Korea since Bush took office. Three rounds of talks involving North Korea, the United States, China, Russia, South Korea and Japan have been held, but the North has refused to join a fourth session. Analysts suggest that North Korea is waiting to see the result of the November 2 US election before returning to talks.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[At least three Palestinians died Friday when an Israeli helicopter fired a missile at the Jabaliya refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip, medics and witnesses said. Another 10 people were injured in the strike, which was initially thought to be caused by a tank shell. The missile struck near a house in the Al-Sikka neighbourhood in the eastern district of the camp, they said. The identities of the dead were not immediately known. Earlier, two armed militants from the radical Hamas movement were killed during an Israeli air raid on the camp. The latest casualties lifted the toll to 44 Palestinians killed since the start of the massive Israeli operation in the northern Gaza Strip, codenamed "Days of Penitence", on Tuesday night. Thirty-two of the Palestinian victims along with two Israeli soldiers and a Jewish settler were killed on Thursday alone.

		<t><![CDATA[Dollar steadies as dealers look to G7 meeting.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The dollar steadied Friday after the previous day's sharp falls as dealers looked for direction from manufacturing data and a weekend Group of Seven meeting of finance ministers and central bankers. The single European currency fell slightly to 1.2421 dollars from 1.2435 late on Thursday in New York. The dollar rose to 110.39 yen from 110.02 on Thursday. The Japanese currency found only modest support from a better-than-expected quarterly survey of business confidence from the Bank of Japan. The survey showed business confidence among large manufacturers rising to a 13-year high as base material producers benefited from surging crude oil and commodity prices, economists said. However, they noted the survey also showed a slowdown in the pace of improvement in business sentiment, with the headline diffusion index for large manufacturers showing only a four-point improvement on June's level. "Whilst the headline number was stronger than expected, the breakdown of the report is slightly more mixed," noted analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. "The yen is higher on the day, but has subsequently eased from its highs," they added. The G7 meeting in Washington, which was due to begin Friday and continue over the weekend, remained the principal focus of attention. Delegates were expected to discuss the effect of high oil prices on the global economy. There was also speculation in the market about whether China might reassess its policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar. "Talk of the peg has been rife this week with the IMF urging China to use this period of strong economic growth as an opportunity to reassess the flexibility of its currency," said Steve Pearson, currency analyst at HBOS. Analysts said any such talk was likely to be be positive for the yen and other Asian currencies and negative for the dollar, though many were sceptical that China would make such a decision just yet. "We maintain our downside bias for the dollar/yen rate over the near-term based on our view that the outcome of the G7 meeting over the weekend will be positive for yen sentiment," Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein analysts said. The market was also looking ahead to US Institute for Supply Management's survey of manufacturing activity across the country due to be published later Friday. Following improvements in other recent surveys, the ISM reading was expected to be on the strong side, supporting the dollar, dealers said. The euro was changing hands at 1.2421 dollars against 1.2435 late on Thursday in New York, 137.07 yen (136.79), 0.6884 pounds (0.6861) and 1.5480 Swiss francs (1.5492). The dollar stood at 110.39 yen (110.02) and 1.2467 Swiss francs (1.2455). The pound was at 1.8041 dollars (1.8117), 199.16 yen (199.27) and 2.2493 Swiss francs (2.2565)s, will try to obtain a controlling stake in the Scottish club which had 1.1 million pounds in losses last year. For Hearts fans it would mean new hope that their legendary Tynecastle Stadium would be saved from being sold. A 22 million pound deal had already been agreed to pay off debts. Romanovas will try to persuade former chairman Leslie Deans and Scottish Media Group who, like Robinson, each have roughly 20percent of the club's shares. Romanovas is likely to succeed with Deans, as he has already said he is willing to do business with Romanov. "We have been speaking to Mr Romanov for some time," Deans told the BBC. "I have not heard anything with regard to Chris Robinson but I am hoping the deal between Mr Romanov and he goes ahead. "I have no problem in selling to Mr Romanov. If there is any more to say, we will have to wait and see how this pans out now."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japan's super-fast rail service, known worldwide as the bullet train, marked its 40th birthday Friday, amid concerns over an anticipated giant earthquake and growing competition from airlines. The Shinkansen, meaning "new trunk line", was introduced as the world's fastest train service in the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, showcasing technological prowess in the country's rapid industrialisation. Trains on the original Shinkansen route between Tokyo and Osaka along Japan's Pacific coast have carried 4.2 billion passengers and travelled a total of 1.5 billion kilometres (937.5 million miles). The total exceeds the distance between the sun and the planet Saturn and is far enough to girdle the globe 37,500 times. The Shinkansen network, partly funded by the government, has since spread around Japan's main island of Honshu with the maximum speed raised to 300 kilometers (188 miles) per hour to rival France's TGV. The first Shinkansen train ran at the maximum speed of 210 kilometers (131 miles) per hour. In October 2005, the Shinkansen train will make its overseas debut in Taiwan. "We will go on by enhancing the Shinkansen's brand image of safety, punctuality, amenity and convenience," JR Tokai managing director Takashi Tategami said, referring to down-to-the-second timetables and computer-controlled operations. "Our service has supported Japan's economic growth in the past 40 years," he told a ceremony at Tokyo's central station. Morning bullet trains are packed with travellers on business trips, seeking to cover many miles without staying overnight. Some companies even subsidize train fares for long-haul cen train, running at 120 kilometers (75 miles) per hour, smashed a car stuck on a snow-covered track from behind, killing its driver, in Yamagata, some 300 kilometers (188 miles) north of Tokyo, in January 2001. Level crossings are installed on such feeder lines in mountainous northern Japan where Shinkansen trains have to use ordinary tracks at slow speed.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[At least 90 people were killed and 180 wounded as 3,500 US and Iraqi forces thrust into the restive Iraqi town of Samarra where the US military said on Friday its troops had seized back the city hall and police stations. The attack was aimed at reclaiming one of the insurgent areas in the Sunni Muslim triangle ahead of nationwide parliamentary elections planned for January. The US military said the offensive was in response to what it called "repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces" (US military terminology for insurgents) and had "secured the government and police buildings in Samarra". About 2,500 US troops from five 1st Infantry Division battalions and 1,000 Iraqi army and national guardsman stormed the city before dawn on Friday. Tanks rumbled in the streets and AC-130 helicopter gunships roared overhead. Clashes flared between gunmen and soldiers in the city centre around the Imam Ali al-Hadi shrine. Smoke billowed in the sky as the soldiers and insurgents traded fire on the hallowed ground, sacred to Shiites, who still come on pilgrimage to visit the mosque in the heartland of the Sunni Muslim insurgency. The Iraqi army's 36th commando battalion secured the area and there was no damage to the shrine, the military said, adding thocal Iraqi officials were close to brokering to allow Americans to return to Samarra. "An agreement will be announced soon. A previous signed plan with the coalition will be ready to work again, and I will tell you as soon as its finished," Qaissy said. However, the military strike went ahead. The Americans moved in with the backing of the Iraqi interim government, whose deputy prime minister Barham Saleh announced Thursday the intention to seize back rebel enclaves before November.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[0410 GMT 01:10:27.]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[CANNES, France, Oct ars the market has been in the doldrums," Paul Johnson, director of Reed MIDEM's television division, told AFP. But the strong rise in the number of participants at an earlier trade show, MipTV, indicated "we are tracking well for MIPCOM", he said. A total 1,326 exhibiting companies from over 57 countries has signed on, up 12.8 percent and seven percent, respectively, from figures a year ago. Countries offering programmes for sale for the first time will be Indonesia, Iran, Ivory Coast, Lithuania, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. Interest in Asia continues to ride high, particularly in the potentially enormous Chinese market. Johnson said he expected Asian participation in MIPCOM to be up more than 10 percent this year, whilst the number of Asian/Pacific buyers due in town was expected to more than 16 percent up on 2003. Most of the world's heavyweight TV and film studios will be present including Warner Bros., Paramount Twentieth Century Fox. But the industry's Lilliputians, who often lack the financial clout to pay for stands, will also be out in force this year. Almost 1,700 companies are expected to pitch up in surrounding hotel rooms and do business in cafes and restaurants -- 36 percent more than in 2003. Television will also share the spotlight with the latest darling of the entertainment industry: the booming mobile telephone market. Mobile ringtones and games are already big money earners and leading executives from the sector will use MIPCOM to brainstorm to see how they can cash in on the enhanced viewing opportunities offered by the latest generation of third-generation videophones. While mobile telephones are not expected to overtake television as the main broadcast media, they are proving to be a popular way of viewing small snippets of content. Italian mobile operator 3 recently signed a deal with Turner Broadcasting that enables its subscribers to view Cartoon Network shows such as Powerpuff Girls on the new roll dolls that were all the rage in the 1960s, is coming in for a lot of attention. The re-looked colourful teen troll characters could become all the rage, just in time for Christmas.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Japan regrets French minister's comments on nuclear project.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Japanese official said Friday he regretted a French minister's suggestion that France is going to host a revolutionary nuclear energy project while the site is still in dispute. The European Union and Japan are vying to host the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a test-bed for what is being billed as a clean, safe, inexhaustible energy source of the future. The United States and South Korea support the Japanese candidate site to host ITER, but the European Union, Russia and China back the French site in the southern town of Cadarache. "We have conducted six-party talks up to now. In the midst of those talks, it is very unfortunate that France is saying the project will go ahead without a decision having been reached," Takahiro Hayashi, deputy director of Japan's Office of Fusion Energy, told AFP. Hayashi was responding to French research minister Francois d'Aubert's comments Thursday that Europe could go ahead with the ITER project in Cadarache even if the United States, Japan and South Korea disagreed. The Nihon Keizai economic daily quoted the minister as saying construction would begin in Cadarache even if the site lacked US, South Korean and Japanese support. "Given the situation today, it's Cadarache," D'Aubert told reporters on a tour of the site Thursday. "Frankly. we are on the right path," he said. "I'm not saying we are on the home stretch, but it's not far at all." The European Union reaffirmed its desire last month to get broad international backing for the project, but sources said the EU was growing anxious about delays on picking a site and might in the last resort go ahead at its own location. Wrangling over the decision is expected to focus on a meeting of the six partners in Vienna in mid-October, hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency. A next meeting of the ITER six-party group has not been set although negotiations are under way to hold it at the end of the month, Hayashi said. D'Aubert has argued the 10 billion dollar project could be launched with EU, French, Russian and Chinese funding. India, Brazil and Switzerland are also interested in participating and could be asked to shoulder some of the remaining costs, he has said. D'Aubert is expected to visit Tokyo by the end of the year for regular scientific exchanges between France and Japan. The project, emulating the sun's nuclear fusion, is not expected to generate electricity before 2050.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[NATO said Friday it has fulfilled its pledge to boost its peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan ahead of October 9 presidential elections, with some 9,000 troops now in the violence-wracked country. Alliance chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said a fifth Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) has reached operating capability in Pul-I-Khumri in northern Afghanistan, as part of the International Security Assistance Force. "This brings to an end the first phase of ISAF expansion as well as ISAFs augmentation in support of Afghanistans presidential elections," he said in a statement. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has commanded ISAF since last year, agreed at a June summit to expand the number of PRTs in the north of the country as well as providing extra forces for the election period. The poll reinforcements are due to stay in Afghanistan for about eight weeks to help local security forces in the central Asian country, where more than 15,000 US soldiers are deployed to tackle fighters loyal to the Taliban in the south and east. They are supported by some 2,000 allied troops. Some 10 million voters are registered to take oup said in a statement. The BBC expected to save about 45 million euros each year over the life of the contract. Siemens Business Services would use the deal as a platform to expand its already well established media business, it said. Under the terms of the deal, Siemens would run and maintain BBCs IT infrastructure including networks, servers, desktops, telephones, broadcast system and the internet site www.bbc.co.uk. Siemens would also provide IT consulting, it said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Singapore share prices closed marginally lower Friday, dropping 0.18 percent as gains in blue chip stocks were capped by profit-taking ahead of the weekend, dealers said. The Straits Times Index closed down 3.60 points at 1,981.14, while the broader All Singapore Equities index inched up 0.12 points higher to 518.04. Volume was 682 million shares worth 644 million Singapore dollars (381 million US), compared with 685 million shares worth 705 million Singapore dollars on Thursday. Losers led gainers 194 to 144, with 432 stocks unchanged. "There's a bit of profit-taking after yesterday's gains. In the coming weeks, the market should be a tad more exciting with companies releasing earnings results," a dealer at a local brokerage said. Dealers said that while oil prices have retreated from record highs seen earlier this week, investors remain cautious as crude oil futures continue to trade near 50 US dollars a barrel. Among blue chips, Singapore Telecommunications was up two cents at 2.36 Singapore dollars, ST Engineering rose one cent to 2.11, Singapore Airlines was flat at 10.90 and Singapore Press Holdings shed 10 cents to 4.64. Neptune Orient Lines climbed 18 cents to 3.00 on speculation that the shipping firm is on the verge of making a major acquisition now that state investment firm Temasek has raised its stake in the company to 68.64 percent. Banks were flat to lower, with DBS down 10 cents at 15.90, United Overseas Bank down 20 cents at 13.50 while Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. was unchanged at 14.00. Technology stocks ended mixed, with Venture down 10 cents at 16.40, Creative Technology down 10 cents at 18.50, while Chartered Semiconductor rose one cent to 1.04.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Marianne Vos of the Netherlands won the junior women's world road race title after a thrilling last lap breakaway here on Friday. Vos, who came fifth in the junior women's time-trial a few days ago, initially attacked at the start of the 73.75km race before settling into the peloton. The 17-year-old high school student then attacked again on the last of the race's five laps before bringing the race home in 2hr 11min 44sec. Despite a late push in the final stages of the last lap, her pursuers could not make up ground and came over the finish line just over 30secs later. Italian Marta Bastianelli dominated a 15-strong sprint finish to claim silver while another Dutch rider, Eleonora Van Dijk, took the bronze medal. Vos's victory means that Dutch riders, the most famous of whom is the recently-retired four-time Olympic champion Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel, have won the women's junior road race world title for the past three years.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The African Union confirmed Friday that the Sudanese government has "formally accepted the reinforcement of the AU force" in Darfur, the western region of Sudan in the grips of civil war, but denied that any accord had been signed. "I confirm that the Khartoum government formally accepted the reinforcement of the AU force," said AU commissioner for peace and security Said Djinnit, reacting to a declaration by the Sudanese ambassador to Ethiopia quoted Friday in Sudan's Al Sahafa daily. Djinnit did not specify by how many troops the force would be beefed up. However, he told AFP here by telephone from AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, "no accord has been concluded" on reinforcing the troop presence in Darfur. Sudanese envoy Osman al Sayyed was quoted by Al Sahafa as saying that an accord providing for the deployment in Darfur of 3,500 more soldiers and 800 more police officers was signed Thursday in Addis Ababa by Sudan's Deputy Foreign Minister Salih Fidhail al Tigani and Djinnit. The AU currently has some 300 soldiers in Darfur, whose task is to protect some 150 observers monitoring a ceasefire reached in April between Khartoum and Darfur rebel groups. Both of the warring sides in Darfur, where, according to UN estimates, 50,000 people have died since war broke out in February 2003, have accused the other of repeatedly violating the April truce. Sudan has been under pressure from the international community to rein in its proxy militia group, the Janjaweed, fighting on its behalf in Darfur and accused of massive human rights violations.]]></c>

Policemen fired in the air to disperse the crowds gathered to pray at the town's grand mosque as they chanted pro-Sadr slogans. The mosque has been closed since a US-led assault on nearby Najaf, 160 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, in August which ended with the exit of Sadr's militia from the Imam Ali mausoleum on the orders of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most prominent figure in Iraq's Shiite religious authority. Since then US and Iraqi forces have been clamping down on Sadr's movement, raiding its offices in Najaf and arresting nearly 40 of his deputies and partisans and pounding his militia's positions in Baghdad's Sadr City slum.]]></c>

Airlines from Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have accumulated 22.8 million dollars (18.4 million euros) in unpaid fees over the past several years, the ministry said in a statement. When contacted by telephone, the ministry was unable to say Friday morning whether the ban on flying over Russian territory had gone into effect. According to Russian press, authorities are holding negotiations with most of the companies and only those from Georgia risk having their flights interrupted. Sixteen Georgian airlines are liable for 3.6 million dollars in fees for having overflown Russian territory between 1994 and 2001 but they have all gone bankrupt since then. Russian authorities have decided to make new Georgian airlines that have taken up the routes of their predecessors liable for the fees, which Tbilissi contests.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices held steady on Friday as Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that his government would not tolerate any "undue militancy" in the oil-rich Niger Delta. The price of light sweet crude for November delivery fell four cents to 49.60 dollars a barrel in pre-opening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November lost eight cents to 46.30 dollars in early deals. Oil prices hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in out-of-hours deals in New York on Tuesday and 46.80 dollars in London on Tuesday amid unrest in Nigeria. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," Obasanjo said in a televised speech to mark 44 years of Nigerian independence from Britain. Obasanjo said his government was continuing to hold talks with rebel leaders from the Niger Delta and assured that a "rapprochement" was taking place. "It is possible that the president's speech in Nigeria, being hopeful of a solution, eased some concerns" about supply disruptions, Investec analyst Bruce Evers said. "But it is an uneasy truce, a very fragile one. The situation can blow up again very quickly. Neither side trusts the other. If these rebels do not get what they want, there is going to be violence. "If the violence escalates, oil prices will go straight back above 50 dollars again," Evers cautioned. Rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari began talks with officials in Obasanjo's government on Wednesday ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to pull out of Niger Delta. Crude oil exports account for 95 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income and about 65 percent of budgetary revenues. "Nigerian oil is seen as crucial (by markets) because it is light, sweet oil, favoured by refineries and currently in short supply while there is a glut of sour crude," analysts at the Sucden brokerage firm said. Oil prices have endured a roller-coaster week, rising sharply at the start before falling Wednesday and creeping back up a day later. Prices fell mid-week as peace talks began in Nigeria and US crude oil inventories showed a surprise increase a week after tumbling to their lowest levels since February. The US Department of Energy said crude oil reserves rose 3.4 million barrels in the week to September 24 to 272.9 million barrels, a week after a spectacular drop of 9.1 million barrels due to Hurricane Ivan.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Denmark's Hong Kong-born Princess Alexandra will receive her own budget for life from the Danish government following her divorce from Prince Joachim, the government announced on Friday. Until now, the princess's so-called civil list has fallen under that of Prince Joachim. Alexandra will receive about 1.73 million kroner (233,000 euros, 288,000 dollars) a year, which will be tax-free unless she remarries, a statement from Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's office said. Prince Joachim's civil list will as a result be reduced from 2.56 million kroner to 1.83 million kroner a year. The new civil lists will be part of a bill the prime minister will present to parliament later this month, which is expected to be passed. The couple announced on September 16 that they were to divorce after almost nine years of marriage. Newspaper reports said the couple had grown apart as the prince grew increasingly fond of wild parties and fast cars. Joachim, 35, and Alexandra Manley, 40, married in 1995. They have two sons, Princes Nikolai and Felix, aged five and two. Joachim will continue to live in the couple's official residence, the countryside Schackenborg Manor in southern Jutland, while the princess and the two boys will temporarily live in the couple's apartment at the Amalienborg palace in Copenhagen. According to media reports, the princess and the boys will later move into the former residence of the Slovenian ambassador in Copenhagen, which the prince has bought for seven million kroner (942,000 euros, 1.16 million dollars).]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISLAMABAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A suspected suicide bomb blast ripped through a Shiite Muslim mosque during Friday prayers in the eastern Pakistani city of Sialkot, killing at least 16 people and leaving dozens injured, police said. Hundreds of worshippers were packed into the Mistri Abdullah Imambargah mosque in the city center when the huge explosion tore through the building, police spokesman Mohammad Ihsanullah told AFP. "It is an act of terrorism which has claimed 16 lives and injured around 40 people," city police chief Nisar Ahmed told AFP. "We believe a suicide bomber carried out the dastardly attack at a time when hundreds of worshippers were present inside the mosque for Friday's prayers," Ahmed said. He said several hundred angry protesters poured onto the streets outside the mosque after the blast and clashed with police. Witnesses said body parts and blood were spattered across the interior of the mosque, a of whom co-habit peacefully, have been killing each other since the 1980s. The conflict has so far cost over 4,000 lives. Pakistani officials say Osama bin Laden's Sunni fundamentalist Al-Qaeda network has been increasingly linking up with local Pakistani groups to launch terrorist attacks and fuel the sectarian conflict with the Shiite community. The hardline and banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was blamed for two bomb attacks on Shiite moques in the southern port of Karachi in May and June which left 45 people dead. The latest bombing also comes as the Pakistani security forces are locked in a fierce battle against Al-Qaeda which has seen a number of important arrests since July. The most notable were Pakistani computer expert Naeem Noor Khan and Tanzanian Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, who has been indicted by a US court for his role in the twin bombing of American embassies in East Africa in 1998. Musharraf, who threw his support behind the US "war on terror" after the September 11 attacks, said this month he was making significant inroads into breaking the Al-Qaeda network and that over 600 Al-Qaeda suspects had been detained.]]></c>

Police chief Da'i Bachtiar said DNA tests comparing samples found at the scene of the September 9 blast with tissue and blood from suspects' families confirmed the bomber's identity as Heri Kurniawan, alias Golun. "We have a very strong conviction that this person carried thari and Noordin are also suspected of playing major roles in the October 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people and an August 2003 bomb blast at the Marriott hotel in Jakarta.

"Their ability to influence people is extraordinary. Noordin even managed to marry someone while on the run," Bachtiar said. More than 200,000 leaflets bearing the pictures of nine men wanted for terrorism including the embassy blast have been distributed by police, including the Malaysians and another key suspect Rois, alias Iwan Darmawan.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BISHKEK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Iran will begin buying electricity this year from Kyrgyzstan as part of a bid to build ties in former Soviet Central Asia, now largely under Russian control, a top Iranian official said here Friday. Delivery of a first consignment of 1,000 megawatts via Tajikistan and Afghanistan could begin by the end of this year, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref said. "The countries through which we plan to organise the electricity transit are providing maximum cooperation," he told reporters. The deal would be part of a recent increase in energy-sector cooperation between Iran and its Central Asian neighbours to the north aimed at overcoming energy shortfalls in northeastern Iran. Tehran has sought to expand its influence in its former Soviet neighbours in recent years, boosting trade ties and providing soft loans for school and road building projects in Kyrgyzstan. In addition to buying electricity, Tehran is ready to invest in restoring this mountainous country's dilapidated hydroelectricity system, Reza Aref said. "In principal we are ready (to invest) and I hope the two sides will reach agreement," he said. With its own oil resources mostly located in the less populated south, Iran has been increasing oil imports under a swap arrangement with Kazakhstan and has also been importing electricity from Turkmenistan. Kyrgyzstan is currently seeking finance for several dam-building projects aimed at boosting hydro-power production, which currently stands only at about 10 percent of its estimated potential of 163 billion kilowatt-hours per year, according to official estimates.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Vattenfall, Sweden's leading power supplier, plans to double in size within the next 10 years and is also expecting public opinion in Germany to change with regard to nuclear energy, its chairman said in a newspaper interview published Friday. "Our vision is to be a leading player in the EU's future single energy market in the next 10 years," Vattenfall chairman Lars Josefsson told the local daily Leipziger Volkszeitung. "We must draw up investment plans with a view of doubling the size of our group," Josefsson said. In future, coal and nuclear power would be most important sources of energy, the chairman said. And there would be a sea-change in opinion with regard to nuclear energy in Germany, which has pledged to phase out nuclear power stations by 2020, he said. "In the next five years, public opinion will shift," he said. Vattenfall has recently expanded massively in Germany, which it has made the hub of its European activities.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[STRASBOURG, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President Jacques Chirac said Thursday that he favours changing France's constitution in order to require a national referendum on Turkey's bid to join the European Union. Speaking at a press conference with Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Chirac said he has asked his government to look at ways of adapting the constitution so that the admission of all new EU members must be submitted to a vote in France. A clear majority of the French public is opposed to Turkish entry to the European Union, and the French government fears the issue will influence a referendum planned for next year on the EU's new constitutional treaty. Chirac repeated his view that Turkey's eventual admission to the European Union is to be welcomed, but said it would take between 10 and 15 years for the country to carry out the reforms required by Brussels. "We have an interest in having Turkey with us, " Chirac said. "It opens the perspective of democracy and peace taking root on the whole of the European continent -- in the wider sense of the term -- so that we avoid the mistakes and violence of the past." Schroeder said he shared the French position on Turkish entry.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Japanese telecom giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) on Friday unveiled cut-rate plans for its land-line services to compete with smaller rivals KDDI and Softbank who have been offering cheaper services. Effective January 2005, NTT will reduce its fixed-line basic monthly charge by up to 150 yen (1.4 dollars) or about 8.5 percent for urban residents. NTT East and NTT West, two regional operating arms, said their monthly fees for households in urban areas will be lowered by 50 yen to 1,700 yen and by a further 100 yen if customers agree to be billed via the Internet. Hoever, even the maximum reduction would still leave NTT's fixed-line fees higher than those offered by KDDI Corp. and Softbank Corp. "This is our best price at this point, to compete with rivals," said an official at NTT West's department of business strategy. Japan Telecom, which Softbank bought earlier this year from Britain's Vodafone, first announced plans to lower its basic monthly fixed-line service fee to 1,550 yen by December. Softbank then said it was considering further lowering its monthly rate, after KDDI, Japan's second-largest telephone operator, announced it would cut its basic fixed-line fee to around 1,500 yen.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft carrying a replacement crew to the International Space Station (ISS) will be put into space on October 14 after technical difficulties postponed the launch, Russia's space agency said Friday. "All the technical problems have been solved and the launch will take place on October 14 at 07:06 am, Moscow time (0306 GMT)," Russian Federal Space Agency spokesman Vyacheslav Davidenko told AFP. The launch of Soyuz TMA-5, which will carry two Russian and one American astronauts to the ISS, was scheduled for October 9 but postponed due to technical difficulties with the craft's stowing system. The spacecraft will take off from the Baikonur launching pad, in Kazakhstan, and will remain 193 days in orbit, Davidenko said. Salizhan Sharipov and Leroy Chiao will replace Russia's Gennady Padalka and America's Michael Fincke, who have been in orbit since April, while Yury Shargin will spend only 10 days on the space station during the relief of the crews. Padalka, Fincke and Shargin are due to land in the steppes of Kazakhstan on October 24 on board the landing capsule of Soyuz TMA-4, which had brought the previous crew to the ISS in April, Davidenko said. Russia, the United States and the European Space Agency are among the main partners in the 16-nation ISS project.]]></c>

UEFA's rankings make Lazio and fellow Serie A outfit Parma the strongest sides in the competition but the 40-team draw will also include former European champions Benfica, Feyenoord and Steaua Bucharest. The eight groups of five teams will include a team from each pool of seeds. Teams play two games at home and two games away with the fixtures decided by the draw. Teams from the same national association cannot play each other but Newcastle, for example, could be drawn against Scottish club Hearts while Middlesbourgh might face either Hearts or Rangers. The top three in each group advance to the knockout stage of the competition where they will be joined by eight teams eliminated from the Champions League. The final takes place in Lisbon next May at the Alvalade stadium, one of the venues for Euro 2004 and home to Sporting Lisbon, one of the teams in Tuesday's draw.

		<c><![CDATA[Singapore share prices are expected to trade firmer next week as the quarterly results season gets under way but volatile oil prices could remain a drag on sentiment, dealers said Friday. The earnings reporting season will begin next week, starting with the Singapore Exchange itself and conglomerate ST Engineering. "In the coming coming weeks, the market should be a tad more exciting with companies releasing earnings results," a dealer at a local brokerage said. Dealers said that while oil prices have retreated from record highs seen earlier this week, investors remain cautious as crude oil futures continue to trade near 50 US dollars a barrel. "It is little surprise that the market is still a bit concerned," another local brokerage dealer said. For the week ended October 1, the Straits Times Index closed up 7.68 points or 0.39 percent at 1,981.14.

		<d><![CDATA[NICOSIA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Greek Cypriots celebrated independence day Friday with a parade long on troops marching in review but with none of the customary menacing military hardware. In previous years, the Greek Cypriot National Guard has used the October 1 parade to show off new and expensive weaponry, but not on this, the 44th anniversary of independence. Gone were the seemingly endless lines of tanks, missiles and long range-guns put on public view, which made for a truncated spectacle. More significantly, there were none of the country's US-made arms on display. Washington has complained that Greece sending American hardware to Cyprus contravenes US law on weapons going to third countries and has been pressing Athens over the past few weeks to take back the weapons. The national guard has been supplied with some US tanks and artillery pieces from Greece's old stockpiles as part of a joint defence accord Athens and Nicosia signed over a decade ago. Nevertheless, a defiant Greek Cypriot government has charged that the Turkish army has 30,000 troops occupying the island's northern third, fully equipped with US weapons that are aimed at the Greek Cypriot south. Greece also maintains a contingent of 950 troops on the island, although their US weapons are not a problem, and Greek Defence Minister Spilios Spiliodopoulos attended the parade. The official reason given for the scaled-down parade is that the army wants to focus on its ground troops, which are the "backbone" of its defence capability. "As you saw, this year the National Guard has put emphasis on infantry troops as they are the army's soul and its strength," Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos told reporters afterwards. A toned-down parade is also in keeping with the current Greek-Turkish thaw. Last month, Athens, Nicosia and Ankara cancelled large scale war games to take place in the region to help reduce tensions and foster trust. The island has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded following an Athens-engineered Greek Cypriot coup to unite Cyprus with Greece.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Italian Rebellin says 'Adios' to world cycling championships.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[VERONA, Italy, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Italian cyclist Davide Rebellin's wish to participate for Argentina in Sunday's world cycling championship road race has been denied after a vital document did not arrive here by Friday's deadline. Rebellin, who has been overlooked several times for national selection for Italy by coach Franco Ballerini, took Argentine citizenship recently in a bid to compete for a world title he believed he could win. However a document which was to arrive at the championships from Argentina did not arrive by midday, prompting the UCI, the sport's ruling body, to rule the 33-year-old Gerolsteiner rider out of the competition. In Sunday's 265.5km road race, the blue riband event of the week-long championships, Argentina's Alejandro Borrajo will now take the place of Rebellin, the current leader of the 10-leg World Cup series. Rebellin applied for an Argentine passsport over a month ago when he feared that national team coach Ballerini would leave him on the sidelines. Ballerini did not select Rebellin for last year's world championships in Hamilton, Canada. Despite a rare early season triple of wins in the Fleche Wallonne, Amstel Gold Race and Liege-Bastogne-Liege, Rebellin was again left on the sidelines for the Olympics which was majestically won by his countryman Paolo Bettini, currently second in the World Cup standings. Rebellin will be distraught at his last-minute exit from his home championships. Given his form this year many people in Italy felt he should have been an automatic inclusion in the team and some former Italian champions have openly questioned why he was left out in the first place. Felice Gimondi hit out: "How can you not pick a guy who's on form. In the world championships, it's vital to have as many riders as possible who can win the race." Italy nevertheless will be one of the favourites for the title on Sunday, although new Olympic champion and two-time World Cup winner Bettini will come under pressure from a strong Spanish contingent. Reigning champion Igor Astarloa and former two-time world champion Oscar Freire, the winner here in 1999 and at Lisbon in 2001, will spearhead their bid. Australia, another medal contender, will look to on-form Stuart O'Grady and Robbie McEwen.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Spain's government to adopt bill legalising gay marriages.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MADRID, Sept 29 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Spain is set to become the first country in predominantly Catholic southern Europe to legalise gay marriages, with the government due to approve a new law Friday despite anger from the Church. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element of his social policy despite outrage from the Catholic Church. If the law is passed by parliament, Spain would become only the third country in Europe, after The Netherlands and Belgium, to allow people of the same sex to marry. But a senior representative of the influential church earlier this week blasted the plans. "It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life," insisted Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference. But according to opinion polls some two-thirds of Spaniards are in favour of gay marriages and once the cabinet approves the bill on Friday such liaisons could become legal from as early as next year. The new law would guarantee married homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual couples concerning divorce, alimony or child support payments, inheritance, citizenship and adoption, reports said. The right for homosexual couples to adopt children would also reportedly be enshrined in the legislation. Some 14 articles of the civil code will be altered so that the words "man and woman" and "father and mother" are replaced by "partners " or "parents". Some eight to 10 percent of the country's population is said to be either gay or lesbian, and homosexual organisations have been angered by the reaction of the Church, lent weight by Pope John Paul II who has also denounced the plans. "This law is part of the Socialist programme which has been voted for by the Spanish. The Church has nothing to say about it. This interventionist tendancy by the Church is the virus and must be eradicated," said Beatriz Gimeno, president of the country's Gay, Lesbian and Transexuals Federation. She welcomed the legislation as "historic, the result of a long fight which will make Spain a pioneer in civil rights in Europe." Zapatero himself, aware that this is a hot potato issue, said earlier this week: "I deeply respect the opinions of the Catholic Church even if they are very critical of the government. I ask them to show the same respect." The bulk of the cabinet is behind Zapatero on the wave of social reforms. However, plain-speaking Defence Minister Jose Bono, who was alone in taking the seals of office with his hand on the Bible, sees warning signs. "If this war against the Church is declared both the Socialist Party and the Church will lose it. Only the Popular Party will gain." The country's main opposition Popular Party has said it plans to propose an alternative law allowing homosexuals to form a "civil union" that would give them the same rights as unmarried heterosexual couples, except the right to adopt.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Indonesia moved closer to full democracy Friday, swearing in legislators elected in landmark polls to a newly-reformed parliament free from military representation. In a ceremony witnessed by outgoing President Megawati Sukarnoputri, 550 members of the upper House of Representatives and a 128-strong senate-style Regional Representatives Council took oaths to serve their country. However, even before the legislators began their work, observers expressed doubts tto scrutiny for abuse of power and corruption. But Bambang Widjojanto of the Partnership for Governance Reform said new measures did not go far enough and greater controls, including a "caucus" of self-regulation, were needed to keep lawmakers in check. "A caucus of legislators that is designed to keep its members from corruption is urgent given the fact that corruption, collusion and nepotism are rampant," Bambang told the Jakarta Post. Hundreds of student demonstrators gathered outside the parliament Friday urging legislators to avoid graft. The protestors tore the gate to the parliament off its hinges, but there were no reports of arrests or violence. In another historic vote on September 20, Indonesians elected to replace Megawati with ex-general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who has pledged to fight the graft which has hampered economic growth when he takes office on October 20. Yudhoyono, who heads the minority Democrat Party, will however face a struggle to impor civilian positions.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices traded just below record highs Friday towards the end of a rollercoaster week that saw New York crude futures pierce the psychological 50-dollar level for the first time as unrest in Nigeria stoked supply worries. Crude oil prices smashed the 50-dollar barrier on Monday for the first time in the 21-year history of oil futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The surge came after a separatist movement in Nigeria threatened to wage war in the troubled Niger Delta region, warning oil majors and foreign nationals to leave by October 1. The delta pumps all of Nigeria's 2.3 million barrels per day of light, sweet low-sulphur crude which is most suitable for refining into petrol. Traders were already fretting over a host of supply worries, including low commercial oil inventories, unrest in Saudi Arabia, recent hurricanes, violence in Iraq and the financial woes of Russian energy giant Yukos. Oil prices eased slightly Friday after Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said his government was continuing to hold talks with rebel leaders from the Niger Delta and assured that a "rapprochement" was taking place. The price of light sweet crude for November delivery fell four cents to 49.60 dollars a barrel in pre-opening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November lost eight cents to 46.30 dollars in early deals. Oil prices hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in out-of-hours deals in New York on Tuesday and 46.80 dollars in London. Adjusted for inflation, world oil prices remain far below the levels reached in the wake of the 1979 Iranian revolution when prices surged to upwards of 80 dollars a barrel in today's money. But prices have more than doubled from about 20 dollars a barrel in New York at the start of 2002, surging by about 50 percent since the start of this year. Markets cooled briefly on Wednesday after US crude oil inventories showed a surprise increase, a week after tumbling to their lowest levels since February. The Department of Energy said crude oil reserves rose by 3.4 million barrels in the week to September 24 to 272.9 million barrels, a week after a spectacular drop of 9.1 million barrels due to Hurricane Ivan. Almost 30 percent of the 1.7 million barrels of daily of production in the Gulf of Mexico remains disrupted by recent hurricanes, according to the US Minerals Management Service, a government agency. So far a total of almost 13 million barrels of output has been affected, the equivalent of 2.1 percent of the Gulf of Mexico's annual oil production. Traders took only limited comfort from a pledge by Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Nuaimi that the kingdom would use two fields which recently came on stream to hike its production capacity to 11 million barrels per day. The Arabic version of Nuaimi's statement said the increase would take place "within the next few weeks." Nuaimi said this would give Saudi Arabia, currently pumping 9.5 million bpd, a surplus output capacity of 1.5 million bpd. But traders said the extra crude would do little to ease supply strains since refineries are thirsty for light sweet crude, as produced by Nigeria, rather than Saudi Arabia's sour crude.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Thailand launched its month-long war on bird flu Friday with more than 900,000 volunteers carrying out house-to-house checks for signs of the disease, a senior health official said. Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has announced a goal of eradicating the disease from Thailand by October 31 and thousands scoured outlying villages and poor areas of Bangkok for sick birds and humans. Thailand, one of the world's largest exporters before the bird flu crisis hit, also said it would overhaul its system of poultry farming to try to prevent future crises. However, both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Thai agriculture minister said the deadline would probably not be met but said the effort signalled Thailand's intention to address the issue vigorously. Officials earlier this week confirmed its first probable case of human-to-human infection of bird flu following the deaths of a mother and daughter. At least 10 people have died in Thailand and 19 in Vietnam from bird flu during two waves of outbreaks this year that have killed millions of birds from across the region. The two confirmed and two suspected cases within a single Thai family in the last week raised concerns that the disease had mutated into a more contagious and lethal form that could trigger a global pandemic. A mutated bird flu outbreak was blamed for the deaths of as many as 40 million people worldwide in 1918. Thai health officials said early indications were that the strain had not changed much and nobody outside of the family had been infected, but tests continued in US and Thai laboratories to discover the full picture. But the health ministry said Friday it had sent bird flu testing kits and anti-virus drugs to 700 hospitals across the country to cope with a potential outbreak among humans. The probable human-to-human case prompted the Thai government to step up its fight against the disease. Thousands of unpaid volunteers, part of a group set up 20 years ago and given some medical training, began work on Friday, according to Thawat Suntrajarn, director general of the Disease Control department. "More than 900,000 of our volunteers, assigned to oversee some 10 households each, will go house-to-house and check the condition of both humans and poultry," he said. A 1,000-strong team of veterinarians and epidemiologists was also being formed to move in swiftly if volunteers warned of suspect cases. But agriculture minister Somsak Thepsuthin conceded the one month deadline would probably not be met. "The bird flu will not end easily but what we have to do is to reduce its was more serious than the first because of the threat of human-to-human transmissions. A meeting would be held Monday between health and agriculture officials over the best way to change the poultry industry, he said. The United Nations has put the number of Thai poultry farms at 3.17 million with more than 99 percent of them raising fewer than 1,000 chickens each.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[New car registrations in France fell 0.7 percent in September from the same month in 2003 to 154,379 vehicles, after a 2.8-percent increase in August, the CCFA manufacturer's association said Friday. "Coming out of a contrasted and calm summer period, the French automobile market has regained a nearly stable position," the association said in a statement.

In September Renault's new car registrations fell by 4.1 percent over the period, after a 14.6-percent jump in August, while Peugeot brand registrations declined 1.0 percent, compared with a 5.4-percent slide the previous month. Over the first nine months of the year, the number of new cars registered has fallen 1.2 percent from the figure for the same period in 2003 and declined 3.3 percent when calculated using the same number of work days to a total of 1,496,389.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Andy Roddick laid on a 21-ace performance Friday to crush Thomas Johansson 6-3, 6-4 and move into the semi-finals of the 550,000-dollar Thailand Open. Roddick, the second seed, admitted that he looks like having no chance at setting another serving speed record as he did last weekend against Balarus. "I don't think it will happen here," said the American who is edging towards a possible finals showdown with hot rival Roger Federer at the Impact arena. "I played aggressive," said the right-hander known for little else. "I played the big points well and took my opportunities when they came up. He didn't give me that many chances to get into his service games." Roddick took just 51 minutes for his victory against the 2002 Australian Open champion, back after knee surgery which kept him away in 2003. Johansson scored only 10 aces and lost serve twice. Roddick never faced a break point. "I was happy to break when I got the chances," said Roddick, winner of three matches in as many days after coming in from weekend Davis Cup play in the U.S. only Tuesday night. "But this kind of win is more than I expected." The result improved Roddick to 69-13 this season, giving him one more victory than top seed Federer, who moved nearer to a 10th title of the season at the expense of another Swede, Robin Soderling, 7-6 (7/3), 6-4.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[At least 90 people were killed and 180 wounded Friday as US troops and Iraqi forces charged into Samarra in a first effort to reclaim troublespots before Iraq's planned elections, while a shocked nation buried 34 children killed by car bombs. In the United States, President George W. Bush and challenger John Kerry held their first debate before the November 2 election, with Kerry terming the invasion of Iraq "a colossal error" and Bush replying that "the world is better off without Saddam Hussein." Iraq's hostage saga showed no let-up, with Jakarta confirming on Friday that two Indonesian women were among the 10 latest people to be kidnapped. Al-Jazeera television said the two were seized along with six Iraqis and two Lebanese working for an electrical equipment firm. The Samarra operation, 125 kilometres (80 miles) north of Baghdad, started before dawn, with the US military saying 2,500 US troops and 1,000 Iraqi forces had seized the city hall and police stations. It followed vows by the interim government to win back swathes of lawless territory in the Sunni Muslim triangle before November to prepare for the January poll. "In response to repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces (US military terminology for insurgents), Iraqi Security Forces and Multi-National Forces secured the government and police buildings in Samarra," the military said. A military spokesman said 94 insurgents were killed, while three US soldiers were wounded. Dr Khaled Ahmed at Samarra's main hospital said 90 people were killed and 180 hurt. Clashes flared between gunmen and soldiers in the city centre around the gold-domed Imam Ali al-Hadi shrine, revered by Shiite Muslims the world over. Smoke billowed into the sky as the soldiers and insurgents traded fire on the hallowed ground, but the Iraqi army's 36th Commando Battalion secured the area and there was no damage to the shrine, the military said, adding that the Iraqis detained 25 insurgents. A Turkish hostage was freed by US troops in the city, the military said. By mid-day, US forces were posted at the city hall and police stations, while Iraqi troops were in full control of religious and cultural sites including the famous spiraling al-Malwiya mosque, built in the 9th century AD on Samarra's outskirts. The governor of Salaheddin province, where Samarra is located, cautioned on Thursday that fresh fighting risked plunging surrounding towns into violence. Unaware of the impending battle, Governor Hamed Hamud al-Qaissy told AFP that local Iraqi officials were close to brokering a deal to allow Americans to return to the troublespot. In a harbinger of the Samarra onslaught, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh vowed Thursday that the US-backed government would assert mastery over cities like Fallujah, considered no-ed Al-Qaeda operative Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi claimed, via its website, responsibility for three suicide bombings in Iraq. Its authenticity could not be verified. Bloodshed also spread to northern Iraq, with four killed and 16 wounded in a car bombing in Tall Afar, where US and Iraqi forces battled insurgents in early September. In other violence, a soldier with US-led forces whose nationality was not immediately known was killed in a rocket attack on an American military support base near Baghdad. US warplanes earlier on Thursday raided what the military termed a suspected safe house of Iraq's most-wanted man Zarqawi northeast of Fallujah. The strike killed three people, local medics said. Early Friday, nine members of Shiite radical Moqtada Sadr's Mehdi Army and three civilians were killed during clashes with US forces in Baghdad's Sadr City slum, according to Sadr's movement and medical sources. Britain, meanwhile, hoped desperately to free 62-year-old British engineer Kenneth Bigley, kidnapped by his group on September 16 in Baghdad, along with two US colleagues who were beheaded last week. Meanwhile, a self-declared French mediator arrived in Beirut after having claimed he had secured a deal for the release of two French reporters kidnapped by the Islamic Army in Iraq on August 20. Against a backdrop of extreme tension in Paris the foreign ministry separately rushed an envoy to Amman.]]></c>

The market rose 2.57 percent Friday, putting it in positive territory for the week as foreign investors came back into the market despite a series of concerns over oil prices, banks bad debt levels and the recent outbreaks of bird flu. "I think the market will be in the positive zone next week. The only main concern is oil prices as I don't know what will developments overseas will be, especially in Nigeria," Teerada Charnyingyong of Phillip Securities (Thailand) said. Nigeria is a major supplier of oil to the United States. Teerada said the market should find support in ongoing foreign investor buying and the participatio of government-run funds. "As well as oil prices being a global negative factor we also have bird flu as a local negative factor that could affect our market sentiment," she added, in a note of caution.

		<d><![CDATA[BEIRUT, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Lebanese officials and foreign diplomats denounced as a grave attack on Lebanon's democracy Friday the bomb that targeted a minister who recently resigned over Syria's domination of the country. Outgoing Economy and Trade Minister Marwan Hamadeh was lightly wounded, his bodyguard killed and his driver slightly injured in the morning attack outside Hamadeh's house on the capital's Mediterranean seafront. Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said in a statement that the incident was meant to hit "efforts to stabilise the internal scene and to consolidate national coexistence, with the participation of all (Lebanese) parties." The president ordered "police and judicial authorities to uncover the (truth) behind this act. which aimed at planting national discord." Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri said "this is a blatant attack against civil peace and stability in Lebanon." In a statement from Paris where he was on a short visit for talks with French President Jacques Chirac, Hariri ordered "security officials who are investigating the attack to promptly uncover those behind this odious crime that targets all honorable men." British Ambassador James Watts, one of a number of people to visit Hamadeh at the American University Hospital, said "this is a very serious incident. "Marwan Hamadeh is a very distinguished man and a Lebanese patriot. An attack on him is an attack on co-existence and on the existence of a democratic Lebanon," he told AFP. Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam arrived in Beirut Friday afternoon and went straight to the hospital, which was crowded by angry friends and followers of Hamadeh. "The Syrian leadership, headed by President Bashar al-Assad, was in great shock went it learned of the attempt on the life against brother and friend Marwan Hamadeh," Khaddam told reporters. "Hamadeh is one of the political personalities that exerted big efforts for the national accord in Lebanon and for the consolidation and coordination of Lebanese-Syrian relations," he said. "We were very happy to hear that our brother Marwan is in good health and we hope that he goes out of hospital quickly," he said. "Undoubtedly this odious crime targets the national accord in Lebanon, and I think that all the Lebanese and those who love Lebanon denounce this crime and hope that our brother Lebanon would enjoy security and stability" Asked about the parties behind the attack, Khaddam said "it is hard to define before the end of the investigation." US Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman and his French counterpart, Phillipe Le Courtier, also visited the hospital. Hamadeh is one of four ministers who quit on September 6 in protest at a controversial Syrian-inspired constitutional amendment that kept Damcorrect an irregular heartbeat has been completed and he is doing well, sources told Sky News television Friday. "Unofficial sources say the prime minister has undergone his heart operation and is doing well," it said on its website. Blair, 51, was admitted to Hammersmith Hospital earlier Friday, a day after he announced in television interviews that he would undergo a routine surgical procedure to current an irregular heartbeat.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISTANBUL, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Turkey said Friday it had scrapped talks in Istanbul next week between the European Union and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) amid a row over the participation of Turkish Cypriots officials. The move followed a call on EU members by the Dutch presidency to boycott the meeting after Turkey inisted on calling the breakaway Turkish Cypriot enclave a "state" at the gathering, the foreign ministry said in a statement. "The decision of the EU presidency not to participate and the appeal it made to other member nations to follow suit. has resulted in the cancellation of this informal gathering of foreign ministers," the statement said. The meeting, which was scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, was intended to promote better ties and understanding between Europe and Muslim countries. The first such talks between the EU and the OIC was held in Istanbul in February 2002, in the wake of the September 11 attacks in the United States the previous year. At the heart of the diplomatic wrangling was a decision by the OIC in June to refer to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot community, which has an observer status in the pan-Islamic group, as "the Cypriot Turkish state," without formally recognizing it. The decision was a gesture to the Turkish Cypriots following the strong support they gave to a UN plan to end the 30-year division of Cyprus in an April referendum. The peace effort failed when the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot south of the island rejected the plan, ensuring that they alone joined the EU on May 1. The Greek Cypriots, backed by EU member Greece, are categorically opposed to any move that could imply recognition of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot statelet in the north, called the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Only Turkey recognizes the TRNC. "We regret the fact that an important initiative, aimed at contributing to world peace by promoting dialogue between civilizations and cultures, has been prevented due to such an unessential reason," the foreign ministry said. "We would like to thank all those EU and OIC countries which had envisaged to take part on a high-level in the forum," it added.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NAHAL OZ ARMY BASE, Israel, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Israeli army's massive operation in the northern Gaza Strip, codenamed "Days of Penitance", is "a necessary and legitimate" operation that will take time, Israeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz said here Friday. "It will be a long activity which will take time," Mofaz told reporters at an army base just outside the southern Gaza Strip three days into the latest campaign to stem the firing of Qassam rockets on Israeli targets. At least 44 Palestinians and five Israelis have been killed since tanks first rolled into the area three days ago. The operation was intensified after two Israeli children were killed in the southern Israel town of Sderot during a Palestinian rocket attack launched from northern Gaza. "The firing by terror organisations on Sderot is intolerable and unforgivable," Mofaz said, saying the operation had one clear, overriding aim: "to prevent the firing of Qassam rockets at Sderot and the firing of mortar shells at Jewish settlements in Gaza. "This activity will take time -- it's not easy, it's complex," he warned. "We will not spare any effort to give the necessary security to the residents of Sderot. Mofaz also said the activity was aimed at showing militant groups they could not expect to force Israel out of the Gaza Strip under fire. "Part of the activity we are undertaking today is to show that we will not allow them to continue their activities against us during the disengagement," he said. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is planning to dismantle all 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip by the end of next year, but a senior official warned earlier on Friday that it would not happen "under fire". "There must be a period of calm and stability in the Gaza Strip before it (the evacuation) goes ahead," the official said on condition of anonymity. "We're working on it."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Jakarta was Friday preparing a team to try to free two Indonesian women whose capture by militants in Iraq has caused surprise and consternation in the world's largest Muslim-populated country. The women, pictured in Islamic headscarves in a video shot by the militants and aired on Arabic television, were seized while working for a British firm by a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq, officials said. Foreign ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa said the group holding the women, named as Rosidah binti Anom and Rafikan binti Amin, appeared to be linked to a group which has been holding two French journalists since August. It has not made any ransom or political demands to Indonesia, he said. "There is a possibility for a ransom. we will not foreclose such possibilities and we will make a decision when that demand is made," he told a press conference. "There are matters that need to be synchronised between our intention to release these hostages and our principal stance. We do not want to give an impression that we are willing to make deals with irresponsible groups. The women, employed by British electronics company G-Bell, were being held "most likely" because of their employer and not because of Indonesia's political stance or role in the Iraq conflict, Natalegawa said. "We do not have troops in Iraq and our political position on Iraq has been known for some time in expressing. Ransoms were paid in some cases to secure releases. Natalegawa said the government was trying to locate relatives of the women to ask them to "make a public appeal to the hostage takers so that they (the women) be released immediately." Indonesia's manpower minister, Jacob Nuwa Wea, said the women had apparently sought work in Iraq without government consent. "We have forbidden our workers from working there because it's difficult for us to give them protection," he said. In August engineer Fahmi Ahmad, 27, became the first Indonesian killed in Iraq since the start last year of the US-led invasion. He was attacked in the northern town of Mosul while working for a London-based contractor. Natalegawa said then that only 13 Indonesians were known to be still in Iraq, including eight students and two embassy employees married to Iraqis.]]></c>

The helicopter heading to Rukum was hit by three bullets soon after it took off from the southwestern town of Surkhet and was forced to land in the Indian border city of Nepalgunj, a police official said. The lead pilot was not injured, but co-pilot Shashi Giri was shot and was undergoing treatment at a Nepalgunj hospital, the official said. He said the helicopter belonged to the private Karnali company and was transporting essential civilian goods to Rukum, a Maoist-dominated mountain town with no reliable road links to urban centres. The Maoists have fired on helicopters in the past, usually on suspicion they were ferrying troops oerview with a radio station Thursday that he was with two French reporters who are being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq.

		<d><![CDATA[HONG KONG, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Asian share markets closed the week on a firmer note, led by solid gains of 1.49 percent in Tokyo after a better-than-expected Tankan survey of business sentiment offset a weaker Wall Street performance, dealers said Friday. Steady oil prices, albeit still near record highs of 50 dollars, allowed investors some respite in generally quite trade with the Hong Kong and Chinese markets closed for the mainland's national day holidays. With the televised debate between President George W. Bush and Democratic candidate John Kerry judged at least initially to have been a tie there was no immediate fallout to contend with although the latest fighting and attacks in Iraq were an unwelcome reminder of the problems there. Taiwan advanced 1.7 percent to within striking distance of the key 6,000 points resistance level despite a larger-than-expected hike of 25 basis points in interest rates, with financials getting a boost since the move helps their margins. At the same time, Taiwan's 'old-economy' industrial conglomerates also found favor on the view that they will still be able to secure better lending terms given their size and diversity. Thailand extended gains, addin over the past quarter, with both corporate spending and profits for the year to March 2005 now expected to rise even more strongly than forecast in June. However, the survey also showed that the improvement in business sentiment is expected to slow substantially over at least the next three months. Share prices rose virtually across the board, with the biggest gains among domestic demand-oriented companies such as the banks, real-estate developers, contractors, drug makers and food and beverage companies. SEOUL: South Korean share prices closed 1.31 percent higher as POSCO and Hyundai Motor rallied on hopes for strong quarterly results, dealers said. After a cautious start following a weaker Wall Street performance overnight, the market gained momentum on the back of Samsung Electronics' share buy-back and Hyundai Motor's solid monthly car sales data. An upgrade on the US semiconductor industry by JP Morgan added to the postive tone. The KOSPI) panel makers remained under pressure as investors take on board concerns about oversupply and increasing competition. "Financials and old-economy industrials took center stage, while bellwether electronics, led by flat-panel companies, remained under pressure," Fubon Securities Investment Services manager Daniel Tseng said. With financials seen as beneficiaries of the central bank's rate hike, leading old-economy industrials turned firmer on expectations that these conglomerates have sufficient negotiating power to hold down funding costs despite the monetary tightening, Tseng said. He added that with the latest gains, the market is now well-positioned to test 6,000 points and beyond in the near term. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was up 1.20 at 44.50 Taiwan dollars (1.31 US dollars) and United Microelectronic Corp up 0.40 at 20.90. HONG KONG: Closed SHANGHAI: Closed SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed spite the recent record advance. "In short, the current share market upturn has further to go," James said. He said the market seems to be paying little attention to the upcoming October 9 federal elections. "So far, the federal election campaign has merely proved to be a blip on financial market radar screens." News Corp. ordinary shares fell 13 cents to 11.28 dollars while its preference shares fell 16 cents to 10.72. SINGAPORE: Singapore share prices closed marginally lower, dropping 0.18 percent as gains in blue chip stocks were capped by profit-taking ahead of the weekend, dealers said. The Straits Times Index closed down 3.60 points at 1,981.14, while the broader All Singapore Equities index inched up 0.12 points higher to 518.04. Volume was 682 million shares worth 644 million Singapore dollars (381 million US). Losers led gainers 194 to 144, with 432 stocks unchanged. "There was a bit of profit-taking after yesterday's gains. In thbaht (577.6 million dollars). "There were two main positive factors -- the stabilisation of oil prices and ongoing foreign buying in blue stocks in anticipation that more long-term funds will enter the market soon," said Charoen Iampatthanatham of Syrus Securities. Leading the rally was the communication sector which rose 5.20 percent to 102.04 points, followed by finance and securities, up jumped 4.22 percent to 1,358.82 points. Bangkok Bank closed unchanged at 94.50 baht while Siam Cement put on 8.00 to 246.00. JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed up 1.92 percent at another record high as investor optimism picked up ahead of the naming of the new president's cabinet, dealers said.

		<c><![CDATA[The United Nations expressed concern Friday about the security of women in Haiti's storm-ravaged city of Gonaives as the distribution of aid makes them targets of armed gangs. "We are concerned about the security of women once they leave the security perimeters around aid distribution sites," said Elisabeth Byrs, a spokeswoman for the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. "They are often threatened and attacked by armed men who steal the aid they have received," she added. UN peacekeepers have had difficulty protecting food aid stores from looters in Gonaives, which was devastated by fierce floods that have left at least 1,554 people dead and 904 missing when Tropical Storm Jeanne hit the area last week. Byrs called for Haitian authorities to step up security in the area, and take greater involvement in affairs generally. She also called for a change in mentality among Haitians as women wait in queues for hours to get food aid and then carry home themselves the heavy sacks of rice while men often stand by idly. Some 700 soldiers from the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) have deployed in Gonaives to protect food aid supplies and assist in its distribution.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The United States rebuffed Friday an EU call for a new delay in implementing US biometric passport regulations, saying it hopes the European Union will be ready by a deadline next October. The European Commission said this week that EU states will not be ready in time for the introduction of the smart passports, which include indicators such as a digital photos and fingerprints on a computer chip. But US Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security Asa Hutchinson indicated no change in the US position. "For some countries in Europe they can make it, not any problem, but for others it's a greater challenge," he said, but added: "We expect and we are hopeful that Europe can meet the deadline of October 2005." "The increased sense of urgency I think will move them forward and we expect full compliance with that, as Congress. indicated, in October 2005," he told reporters in Brussels. The current deadline gives 27 countries in the so-called Visa Waiver Program until October 26, 2005 to issue biometric passports so their citizens remain eligible for travel to the United States without visas. Initially, the EU had asked Washington for a two-year delay from this October and this was backed by the Bush administration, but voted down But a club spokesman denied they had clashed, saying Keown had become surplus to requirements as a player.

		<c><![CDATA[Greek authorities discovered 57 illegal immigrants, most from Iraq and the Palestinian territories when the truck they were hiding in broke down in the northern port of Salonika, police said Friday. The immigrants, all male, were stashed behind empty fruit crates in the truck which had travelled all the way from the Greek-Turkish border, which lies some 400 kilometres (250 miles) to the east. "The driver fled when he heard the police were arriving after his truck broke down. That made us suspicious and we searched the truck," a Salonika police official told AFP. The immigrants told police they had gathered Wednesday in Turkey, where they paid a local people smuggler 2,200 dollars (1,800 euros) each to get them on boats across the Evros river, which marks the Greek-Turkish border. The truck's Greek driver, who escaped arrest, awaited them at the Greek side of the frontier. The vehicle had fake licence plates. The immigrants, who include a nine-year-old Iraqi boy, were under arrest in Salonika. The state of their health was good, police added. EU member Greece lies along a major route for illegal immigration into western Europe. Immigrants arriving by sea, as well as on foot across the mine-strewn Evros river marking the Greek-Turkish border, are detained almost daily. Land-mines have killed about 50 would-be migrants in the region since 1996.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SKOPJE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[EU Commission President Romano Prodi formally opened accession talks with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia on Friday, saying the country was at a crossroads in its history. "This is really a new, important stage in the process of European integration. This is a real step, the first concrete step and this is why it is so important," Prodi told reporters. "This is vital for the future, this is vital for Macedonia, but clearly I repeat this is not a bureaucratic process but a process of working together." Prodi visited the Macedonian capital Skopje to deliver thousands of pages of questions from the EU which will form the basis of future negotiations on Macedonia's membership of the bloc. He told a joint press conference with Prime Minister Hari Kostov that Macedonia would be treated like an "absolutely normal country" such as Slovenia, the only other former Yugoslav republic to have joined the EU. Kostov said "Macedonia is ready" and assured Prodi that the questionnaire would be completed "skillfully and professionally". President Branko Crvenkovski said Prodi's visit marked a "very clear sign of support from the EU". "We want to say that we are. completely prepared to accept all the values and responsibilities of the EU," he said. Prodi was pressed about a controversial EU-backed law to change certain municipal boundaries in favour of the ethnic Albanian minority, which took up arms against the government in a seven-month insurgency in 2001. The law sparked violent demonstrations when it was adopted in August and opposition groups have pulled together to force a referendum on the matter in November. Prodi said it was vital that the law be passed and dismissed fears that it would encourage ethnic Albanian separatism. "I will not tell you how to vote, but I'm sure Macedonians are aware of the consequences. It is a moment of choice toward the future, a future of Europe, of peace, stability and prosperity," he said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A Frenchman presenting himself as an unofficial negotiator said in a telephone interview with a radio station Thursday that he was with two French reporters who are being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq. Philippe Brett told the Europe 1 station by mobile telephone that he was currently in Iraq. When asked if he was was with Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France Internationale, both of whom were kidnapped August 20 along with their Syrian driver, Brett said: "The response is yes." "I can't tell you any more. We are in the process of finalising things. I don't want to compromise this operation which is already sufficiently complicated as it is," he said. The French government has said Brett was not in Iraq on its behalf, with the defence ministry notably stating that his statements were creating "more confusion than certainty". The foreign ministry sent a senior official to Jordan last Friday to make official efforts to secure the journalists' release. Brett has said he went to Iraq to negotiate with the journalists' abductors on behalf of a French parliamentary deputy, Didier Julia, who is a member of President Jacques Chirac's UMP party and vice-president of a Iraqi-French Friendship Group. Julia, an Arabic-speaker with ties to the Middle East, flew to Syria last Thursday to "explore new avenues" for extricating the journalists. His aides have said that the hostage-takers, a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq, wanted to free the two men but were being frustrated by US bombings in the Fallujah area. Chesnot, 37, Malbrunot 41, and their Syrian driver Mohammed al-Jundi were abducted on August 20 south of Baghdad.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Several senior Moscow policemen have been fired over the mysterious death of a man detained with explosives, Russian media reported Friday in the latest twist to the bizarre story. Moscow police chief Vladimir Pronin has fired the head and two deputies of the city's organized crime unit over the September 18 death of Alexander Pumane, reported the respected Kommersant daily citing police sources. "The guilty have already been punished," the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Pronin as saying. It was the latest twist in the bizarre story of Pumane, a 38-year-old navy reservist whom police allegedly stopped with explosives in his car overnight on September 18 in what the FSB security agency hailed as a foiled terror attack. The nighttime operation -- during which FSB sappers defused explosives found in Pumane's car as residents in nearby buildings were evacuated -- received wide publicity since it came two weeks after the Beslan hostage crisis. Pumane -- who according to police was under the influence of drugs and said he was given money to drive the explosives-laden car from one place to another in the Russian capital -- died in hospital hours after being detained. Police originally said he had died of a heart attack. But the next day, Moscow prosecutors launched an investigation into the death, saying Pumane had died of bodily injuries after interrogation. The case turned even more mysterious days later, when Pumane's ex-wife, who came to Moscow to claim the body of the Saint Petersburg native, said that the body shown to her at the morgue was not that of her ex-husband. Neither did the body match a dental chart presented by Pumane's live-in girlfriend of several years. The confusion prompted genetic tests to be performed on the body, with results expected in several weeks. An unnamed police source quoted by Kommerant Friday admitted that Pumane was killed during interrogation. "It's clear that he was killed," the paper quoted an officer as saying. "But the prosecutors are unlikely to establish who did it. Even if somebody did see something he is unlikely to say so." "There was a crowd there and complete mayhem," said the officer who estimated more than 150 policemen had gathered at the station on the night Pumane was interrogated.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LAGOS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Talks between Nigerian government officials and Niger Delta rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari went into a third day Friday under the shadow of a rebel deadline for foreign oil workers to quit the region, a member of the rebel delegation told AFP by phone. He said that some state officials from the Niger Delta were taking part in the latest round of negotiations, which got under way on Wednesday after Asari threatened to wage all-out war against the government. On Monday, Asari issued a statement on behalf of his Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF) -- which says it wants more rights and greater autonomy for the oil-rich region's native Ijaw people -- ordering multinationals and foreigners out of the delta, hub of Nigeria's lucrative oil industry. He said his rebel group would declare all-out war on the government on October 1 if the rebels' demands were not met. In an interview with AFP Thursday in Abuja, Asari said his key demand was for a sovereign national conference to be convened to discuss the country's problems, and warned he would resume hostilities in the delta if Obasanjo failed to meet that demand. He also said he would return to the delta region Thursday, whether or not the talks had reached a conclusion. The member of his entourage told AFP the group would "definitely" leave Abuja Friday. Obasanjo said in a nationwide radio-television speech Friday to mark Nigeria's 44th independence anniversary that his government will not tolerate any "undue militancy" in the delta region. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," he said. "Government will not tolerate in any way or form any act that would mortgage or compromise the interest of the majority." The region accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's crude output of 2.3 million barrels per day. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, derives more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange earnings from oil. The unrest and war rumblings in the delta region have sent oil prices on an upward spiral which saw them burst through the 50-dollar-a-barrel barrier on Tuesday, but drop back below the crucial mark when the peace talks began.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGALORE, India, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[India's outsourcing industry faces a major "talent challenge" as a lack of skilled employees threatens its global success, company officials and analysts say. While call centres are flourishing in India, they represent only a small portion of the global outsourcing market and nearly 97 percent of future work will involve high-end analytical processes such as banking and marketing applications. Avinash Vashistha, managing director of NeoIT, an outsourcing advisory and consulting firm, said India is not ready to meet new demands and the industry could be badly hurt if supply shortages are not overcome soon. "Outsourcing as defined by call centres is only three percent of the global pie," he told AFP. "The rest lies in core analytical processes like banking, human resources and order-to-cash process which has not been offshored yet." "We're not ready to address this market. Most of it is going to Israel, Ireland, central and eastern Europe," he said. The Indian industry wants universities and IT institutes to set up separate training departments for the high-end outsourcing industry where students would learn advanced mathematics, sciences and marketing. For example, said Srikanth Kannapan, a senior vice president at Symphony Services, "in the marketing analytics industry, what's required is a unique blend of mathematics, business, software and language competencies." For such work, "we need people with advanced degrees in marketing, econometrics, statistics and related fields who are sometimes hard to find." In a report this month, the UN Conference on Trade and Development estimated investment in offshore "business processing" would balloon to 24 billion dollars by 2007 from 1.3 billion in 2002. It said among the world's 1,000 largest companies, 70 percent have still not outsourced any business processes to lower-cost countries. Outsourcing advisor Vashistha said there was a huge demand from global clients to do work in cheaper destinations such as India, where engineers cost one-seventh of their US counterparts. "Demand is exploding. For high-end processes, a better knowledge of the industry is a must. There's a big problem here as we've a tremendous shortage (of skilled people). If steps aren't taken now, the industry will suffer." India's revenues from outsourcing are forecast to leap 40 percent in the financial year ending March 2005 to 5.1 billion dollars. The National Association of Software and Service Companies, India's leading IT body, projected in a recent report the nation's ounning with the tiger of creativity". Jean-Paul Gaultier, Helmut Lang, Alexander McQueen and Paul Smith, have all received a helping hand from the Florence-based company, which has earned a reputation as a laboratory for youthful talent since the 1960s. The original family firm hit the rocks when the economic bubble burst at the end of the 1980s but Pene built a new company from scratch on the ashes of the old with the partnership of the Japanese group Onward Kashiyama and since then it has manufactured and distributed the work of some of the hottest talents on the international scene. "It's down to our company's strategy. Half of it is like any other business, but half is venture capital. We have always taken risks. Take Paul Smith. When we started to work with him he was nearly bankrupt and he had never done anything for women, only men." Gibo backed him to produce a range for women. Another recent success has been the launch of the oddball Dutch design duo Viktoe from in the next 10 years. Brazil maybe, or eastern Europe, somewhere that is under-developed," he says, pointing out a bad environment seems to stimulate creativity, as in the case of most of the world's greatest artists when they started out. What he looks for is "a strong concept, a signature" --- and a very big ego. "I have never met a successful designer without a strong ego. They must believe absolutely that they are the best in the world." Personal taste must not be allowed to come into play, "otherwise you would not be able to back some designers." At the same time, he stresses that the relationship between Gibo and its fledgling designers, has to be very close. "In some ways, yes, they are our babies and we are their incubator, or at least their primary school," he laughs. So how does he feel if they decide to move on, finding new financial backers, like Alexander McQueen at Gucci and Helmut Lang at Prada. "Emotional, of course," he replies frankly. "Also, from a business point of view it means that somebody wants to buy them because they are getting interesting. But it doesn't matter how many shares you have, you can never control the mind of a designer."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KIEV, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Millions of Ukrainians abroad will be deprived of their right to vote in this month's presidential election due to an "alarming" absence of polling stations that could unduly influence election results, experts say. "The situation is alarming because most of these citizens will be deprived of their constitutional right," Boris Tarassyuk, chairman of the parliamentary committee on European integration and an opposition member, said Wednesday. Up to seven million Ukrainian nationals currently live and work, often illegally, outside of Ukraine -- a substantial number of potential voters in a country that officially counts 37 million eligible voters. But so far, Ukraine's electoral commission has made provisions to set up a total of only 113 polling stations abroad, capable of handling 220,000 voters on October 31, election day. Valentin Nalivaychenko, a deputy foreign minister, said Kiev had asked several countries with high Ukrainian populations -- Russia, Italy, Portugal, Canada and the United States -- for permission to open more voting stations. But even if those additional polling places are opened, they will not bridge the huge gap between the number of potential Ukrainian voters and facilities to receive them, raising chances for fraud in the election, according to experts. "Ballots for Ukrainian voters abroad who are unable to vote could be fraudulently counted in Ukraine in favor" of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, said Ilko Kucheriv, head of the Foundation for Democratic Initiative, a non-governmental political organization. Democratic shortcomings in the presidential vote, scheduled for October 31, have already been denounced by western officials. A team from the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly on Wednesday expressed concern about respect for democratic norms in the election campaign. National polls currently give Viktor Yushchenko, head of the liberal opposition coalition Our Ukraine, a five-point lead over Yanukovich, the candidate chosen by the current administration to succeed President Leonid Kuchma. Most Ukrainians living outside the country would cast their ballots for Yushchenko, according to a survey conducted this month in eight European countries as well as Russia and the United States by the Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation headed by Tarassyuk. "Ukrainian emigres are generally from regions in the west of the country where Yushchenko is very popular," said Kucheriv. "The fact that most of them will not be able to take part in the vote amounts to an important loss for this candidate." According to the same survey, more than 80 percent of Ukrainians living abroad say they would lParty of putting Aboriginal issues in the too-hard basket. "The campaign so far has been almost devoid of any constructive mention of indigenous affairs or indigenous people," he said. Aboriginal communities remain blighted by drug abuse and alcoholism, with life expectancy 20 years below ordinary rates and indigenous people vastly over-represented among prison populations, suicide victims and the homeless. Remote outback communities are plagued by "chroming" -- petrol sniffing -- among Aboriginal youngsters, while indigenous populations in major cities suffer high crime rates and drug use. Tensions in Sydney were exacerbated in February by a riot after police were blamed for the death of an Aboriginal youth. "The health of indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islanders remains the most appalling and the worst in the world," Australian Medical Association president Bill Glasson said recently, calling for a major boost in funding for Aboriginal health care. hildren", a generation of Aborigines taken from their parents when they were young in an attempt to assimilate them into white society. Howard plans to replace ATSIC with an appointed body of Aboriginal elders, in an attempt to make spending more focused and effective. Ridgeway accused the government of blaming victims and said steps needed to be taken to create more meaningful self-determination for Aborigines. "Stop beating up on people who are on welfare, and focus on solving the national indigenous unemployment rate," he said. "This has been the hallmark of his government. They spend their time attacking indigenous people and indigenous leaders but fail to deliver anything substantial for indigenous people by any measurement-even by their dodgy "practical reconciliation" measure." Opposition Labor Party leader Mark Latham has agreed to the abolition of ATSIC but says an elected body is still needed for Aborigines. He has also pledged to make an apoldicted a tight race, with voter turnout to be crucial as the opposition did well in European parliamentary elections in June when participation was a dismal 28 percent. A poll by the influential newspaper Delo said the centre-right opposition's Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) would win the most votes with 21.5 percent, followed by the LDS with 21.3 percent. This was with a projected turnout of around 74 percent. But Dnevnik projected 24.3 percent support for the ruling LDS followed by 23.2 percent for the SDS, based on turnout of over 80 percent. Both papers agreed the future parliament would have two almost equal blocs, which will make decision-making more complicated than in the outgoing legislature, where the LDS and its allies controlled 58 seats out of 90. Despite having over the past year led Slovenia into the European Union and NATO, the LDS could be hurt at the polls by the absence in the campaign of two of its key figures. Not running for the LDS as centered this year on blaming the LDS for failing to deliver on promises it made in 2000, especially those conerning economic growth, highway construction and increase of pensions. "Over the last four years the LDS has made five fouls (as in basketball) and it is time for voters to replace it as in every fair-play game," Jansa said at a rally in Ljubljana on Wednesday, wrapping up his campaign. But Rop has defended his record, saying that the cabinet he took over from Drnovsek in 2002 led the country into the EU and NATO, started the process for entering the eurozone by 2007, reduced unemployment and is on its way to make Slovenia one of the EU's most developed countries. "I'm convinced we will win. Our victory will lie on our positive program and arguments and neither the polls, the opposition nor provocations will stop us," Rop said at the end of a month-long bus-tour throughout Slovenia.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi derided as "nonsense" depriving the European Union a permanent seat on the UN Security Council at the expense of giving one to Germany in a mooted reform. In an interview to the Corriere della Sera daily Ciampi said the signature of the new EU constitution has changed the situation by making the bloc more of an actor on the international stage. "It would be nonsense that the new European foreign minister didn't have a seat at the UN," said the Italian president. Germany last month launched a joint bid for four permanent seats along with Brazil, India and Japan as part of reforms to the world body, and immediately drew fire from its frequent rival Italy. Pressed on the reasons for Italy's opposition, Ciampi said Germany gaining a seat on the Council "would commit the erroof the five permanent seats reflected the situation following World War II, but has not changed since the UN's establishment in 1945 and has come under increasing criticism.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A Frenchman presenting himself as an unofficial negotiator said in a telephone interview with a radio station Thursday that he was with two French reporters who are being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq. Philippe Brett told the Europe 1 station by mobile telephone that he was currently in Iraq but would not say where exactly. When asked if he was was with Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France Internationale, both of whom were kidnapped August 20 along with their Syrian driver south of Baghdad on August 20, Brett said: "The response is yes." "I can't tell you any more. We are in the process of finalising things. I don't want to compromise this operation which is already sufficiently complicated as it is," he said. He added: "I think that within the next 10 hours or so, I'll be able to (talk to you) with a great deal of pleasure." The French government has said Brett was not in Iraq on its behalf, with the defence ministry notably stating that his statements were creating "more confusion than certainty". The foreign ministry sent a senior official to Jordan last Friday to make official efforts to secure the journalists' release. Brett has said he went to Iraq to negotiate with the journalists' abductors on behalf of a French parliamentary deputy, Didier Julia, who is a member of President Jacques Chirac's UMP party and vice-president of a Iraqi-French Friendship Group. Julia, an Arabic-speaker with ties to the Middle East, flew to Syria last Thursday to "explore new avenues" for extricating the journalists. His aides have said that the hostage-takers, a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq, wanted to free the two men but were being frustrated by US bombings in the Fallujah area.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The trade in some of the world's rarest species, from the fearsome great white shark to the delicate orchid, will be scrutinised here from Sas that law enforcement is a necessary tool in all of this," Adams told AFP. "We don't see our business decreasing." The gathering sets the stage for a new round in several longstanding battles. The CITES meeting, held every two or three years, is again expected to witness fierce debates over whaling and the ivory trade. Japan is heading moves to ease trading restrictions over some minke whale populations which have recovered to one million worldwide after decades when their numbers dwindled through hunting. Another key row is likely over the ivory trade, as some southern African nations with well-managed elephant populations want to make it easier to sell ivory and leather abroad. Conservationists have warned that illegal ivory seizures in Asia have been rising for a decade, driven by strong demand from China. "Asia has always been a big CITES problem with China becoming more and more capable of buying wildlife products," CITES secretary-general Willem Wijnstech as the rhinoceros and bald eagle, because of improvements in numbers. In the United States, the bald eagle population has doubled every seven to eight years. The CITES register has two main sections. The first, most rigorous category has 600 animal and 300 plant species for which all commercial trade is banned except under special circumstances. The second category, with more than 4,100 animals and 28,000 plant species, allows some international trade but only under permit. But conservationists have complained that CITES lacks strong enough enforcement powers and depends on the will of member countries to police the trade which many are powerless, or unwilling, to do. They pointed to the tiger, whose numbers have been reduced by 95 percent in the past century with less than 5,000 thought to be left in the wild, despite being on the CITES list of protected species. Experts say a specialist Interpol-style unit is needed in Asia to take on the organised gastry failed to resolve the problem by that date. Education Minister Maria do Carmo Seabra said at the time that teachers would be assigned to their posts manually and the problem resolved by the end of the month. An education ministry spokesman told AFP all of the nation's more than 12,000 public schools had opened on Friday and were functioning normally. Schools which opened late will be able to extend their academic year by one week to make up for the lost time and the government has opened an inquiry into the delay, which left parents fuming and renewed concerns over the poor state of Portugal's education system. Three in four Portuguese believe the delay in the start of the school year will "greatly" disrupt the school year, a survey prepared for Radio Renascenca, private television SIC and weekly newspaper Expresso found. Only 12 percent of respondents felt the late start to the school year would have little impact, according to the results of the Eurosondagem telephone survey of 1,029 people released on Friday.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Thailand's legal ivory trade a smokescreen for smuggled African tusks.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[In the heart of Bangkok's bustling Chinatown, shops filled with tourist trinkets and antiques hide an illegal multimillion-dollar ivory trade that environmentalists warn is destroying global elephant populations. Inside a cluttered tourist gift shop, an AFP reporter posing as a buyer asked to see banned African ivory and after a heated debate between the shop's two owners was shown smuggled tusks apparently hacked from the head of a slaughtered elephant. In a quiet back room filled with tall stone Buddhas and small ivory trophies, three thick lengths of part-hollow, roughly sawn ivory were laid out along with a large ornately carved tusk witually indistinguishable. The only time officials could easily identify African tusks was when found uncarved as they are usually much larger than the Asian variety. None of it, legal or illegal, can be exported. "As much as 99 percent of the ivory here now is poached African ivory," said Redford. In Asia, only Myanmar allows some domestic trade in ivory but it is more regulated than in Thailand, according to international wildlife trading monitor TRAFFIC. Conservationists want to close the loophole. They may be helped by new research published this month which suggested DNA testing of tusks could help identify the country, or even forest, where the elephant was from. They warned the trade threatened the African elephant as well as their even rarer Asian cousins -- which number as few as 34,000 -- despite a 15-year ban on the trade of their tusks. The ivory trade ban was imposed in 1989 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) afteere". Thailand has made efforts to halt the illegal trade and in 2002 customs agents raided the northern Thai town of Phayuha Kiri virtually shutting down one of the world's oldest and best known ivory carving centres. Earlier this month, Thai customs police intercepted a shipment of smuggled ivory at Bangkok airport valued at an estimated 97,000 dollars. It had come via Singapore in crates marked 'carbon ceramics,' a heat-resistant material used to make ovens. Wildlife experts say the latest seizure highlighted the need for tougher laws and consumer education ahead of this week's CITES meeting in Bangkok bringing together 166 countries. Namibia wants to change the rules to allow it to export 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds) a year of raw ivory from elephants which have died naturally. But environmentalists say this will only open another loophole for smugglers to exploit.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ROME, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Swarms of ravenous locusts are still spreading through and beyond the Sahel region of west Africa where the fight against the pest is being hampered by serious shortages in pesticides and aircraft, the UN food agency warned Friday. UN analysts believe thick swarms of the crop-destroying pests have begun spreading into northwest Africa in the quest for fresh vegetation. Donor funding has increased since an appeal two weeks ago by the director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Jacques Diouf, but more support is urgently needed, the Rome-based agency said. FAO now has 14.7 million dollars (11.8 million euros) in cash, with a further 40 million dollars in pledged contributions, the Rome-based agency said. "While these funds, together with the efforts made by the countries affected, will help to step up control operations, more support is urgently needed to protect crops and pasture and extend locust control activities, in particular transport and spraying planes but also helicopters," said Clive Elliott, Senior Officer of the FAO Locust Group. Experts estimate up to four million hectares (9.9 million acres) of land have been infested by locusts in west Africa, with Mauritania alone accounting for almost half the infested area. Mali, Niger and Senegal are the other major countries affected by the upsurge in locusts, which is causing severe crop damage. And the spread is continuing, according to FAO. In the past week, several locust swarms moved into northwest Mauritania, one swarm reportedly 70 kilometres (45 miles) in length. FAO reported that swarms have also moved into the extreme south of the Western Sahara, and 10 swarms crossing the sea to the Cape Verde islands. "This indicates that swarms are now starting to move out of areas in the Sahel where vegetation is drying up, towards northwest Africa," the agency said. FAO is providing assistance to Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, Eritrea, the Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Sudan and Yemen.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Arsene Wenger has told Wayne Rooney wil have to live "like a monk" if he is to make the most of his phenomenal talent. The 18-year-old's stunning debut for Manchester United in midweek came as no surprise to the Arsenal manager, who has previously described Rooney as the most exciting young English player he had seen. But he also underlined that the forward, who has already had to contend with revelations about his fondness for backstreet brothels, would have to learn how to sidestep the potential pitfalls as effortlessly as he swerves past defenders. "Rooney could be another George Best, I have no doubt," Wenger said. "England is in need of a big, big star and he has what you need from that player - he comes from Liverpool, he is working-class and he has exceptional talent. "But football is a high-level sport and you must live the life of a monk. You have a ritual - you go training, you sleep, you prepare. There is only one thing to be answered - how much do you love to play the game. If you have that love then you can easily sacrifice the rest." United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has a good track record of keeping young stars focused on their jobs, not least by keeping tabs on their activities through an extensive network of contacts in the Manchester area. But Wenger believes it will be down to Rooney to ensure he makes the most of his talent. "All managers can only help those who want to be successful," the Frenchman said. "If he doesn't want to live seriously and wants to drink, he can do it at home and arrange things at home. However, I feel that Rooney has a real love for the game. Would I like to work with Wayne Rooney. Who wouldn't want to work with him. We all like to work with exceptional talent." Arsneal go into Saturday's Highbury clash with Charlton looking to extend their unbeaten run in the Premiership to 48 games after a disappointing Champions League draw with Rosenborg on Wednesday that was followed by a scuffle between skipper Patrick Vieira and defender Lauren. Charlton have a record of giving the Gunners problem and Wenger admitted his side needed to step up from the level of their midweek display. "Charlton never give anything but their all at Highbury and they have shown in their last two matches against Birmingham and Blackburn that they regained their defensive stability," he said. "We are under pressure in every game now and we are ready for that." Dennis Bergkamp is expected to return to the Arsenal line-up at the expense of Jose Antonio Reyes, who looked distinctly jaded in midweek.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president Dick Pound believes that US cyclist Tyler Hamilton does not deserve to keep his Olympic time-trial gold medal after testing positive for doping in Athens. Speaking at a corporate lunch here, Pound said that while the Athens Olympics were a huge success for catching drug cheats, one athlete slipped through the net. "It appears a cyclist might have escaped this net because of human error," Pound said. "But I can assure you it's no longer a gold medal in the eyes of the world. "But if nothing else, we got him on the second bounce." Hamilton twice tested positive for a blood transfusion last month. First in Athens after winning the Olympic time-trial gold medal and then after winning a time-trial in the Tour of Spain. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the result of the B sample in Athens was "non-conclusive" because the sample had been destroyed by being deep-frozen. Hamilton, 33, still faces a possible two-year ban over a separate positive blood test at the Tour of Spain after the Olympics. Hamilton's Phonak team said both blood samples he provided in Spain came back positive.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The war that Vladimir Putin unleashed in Chechnya five years ago Friday lifted him to the presidency and helped the former spy to reshape Russia in a Soviet-era mold. Chechnya is Putin's war almost by definition. He launched it while serving as prime minister amid a wave of terror attacks that killed hundreds and which the government pinned on Chechen guerrillas. The nation's nerves were in shatters and there emerged Putin -- seemingly a man of steel, an unheralded former spy with a hypnotic gaze who vowed to "wipe them (rebels) out in the outhouse if we have to." His countrymen approved -- 68 percent supported the war, compared with 24 percent who were in favor of negotiations. Unlike his predecessor Boris Yeltsin during the first Chechen conflict, Putin won the media war right away -- television delayed news of the Chechen invasion for several days. The first disastrous winter sortie into the rebel capital Grozny by a band of pro-Russian Chechens was angrily dismissed as Western propaganda by the top brass. Independent reporters were soon barred from the scene. So the brutal guerrilla war rumbled on far off in the distance for most Russians while Putin enjoyed astonishing popularity on the back of a personal charisma and a new economic boom. Western criticism of brute force seemed to simply bounce off. And then came September 11, 2001. Putin instantly switched tactics. He was no longer trying to wipe out a few "terrorist bases" targeting Russia from separatist Chechnya but joining a global war on terror. He made a habit of mentioning that he was the first world leader to console George W. Bush over September 11. The State Department put several Chechen groups on its terror list. Putin skeptics say that though some international links do exist, the predominant majority of fighters in Chechnya are home-grown, and that Moscow knows this. "He talks of international terrorism but he knows the roots are there in Chechnya," said Alexei Malashenko of the Carnegie Moscow Center. Instead, some analysts say Putin is using Chechnya as a pretext for instituting top-down reforms resembling those of the Soviet era, for which he has pined in several interviews. These begin with a strong police state. A top official revealed last month that financing for the Federal Security Service (former KGB, Putin's alma mater) has tripled since his rise to power. Defense spending for 2005 is up nearly one third in the wake of recent tragic attacks by Chechen rebels -- including last mohis hardline stance -- no negotiations with "terrorists" -- while others say that he is for the first time addressing the poverty that feeds the region's extremists. "I have a feeling that he expects it to end on its own somehow," said Malashenko. Whatever the case, Putin is unlikely to quietly fade from the stage once his second and last term expires in 2008. "Either he will be heading some sort of government structure or a party but one thing is certain -- Putin will not simply be picking berries in the garden in 2009," said NTV political reporter Vladimir Kondratiev as he signed off on one of his evening reports.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Abducted by masked men, tortured and jailed for alleged murder -- the fate of Azamat Uspayev is the a culprit, so it designated one. It is a Stalinist system," she said. In Chechnya, shattered by the second guerrilla war in a decade, men are regularly rounded up by pro-Russian forces during "mopping up" operations and are often never heard from again. Some are later found dead with signs of torture, while the luckiest ones are bought back by their families for huge bribes. "To obtain a liberation, one has to pay 40,000 dollars. and 15,000 dollars to be judged in Rostov, where the sentences are less severe," asserted Madina. According to the respected Russian human rights group Memorial, at least 4,000 people have disappeared in Chechnya in the past five years. During his trial at Chechnya's high court, Azamat proclaimed his innocence. His relatives were also ready to testify that he was in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia at the time when the murders were committed, but Madina said the court declined to hear them. The testimonies were unlikely to ropol, near Chechnya, before Azamat is sent to a labor camp in Russia's North. Madina will then be allowed to visit him three days a year, but the trip will cost her at least 1,000 dollars because of the bribes she will have to pay to leave Chechnya. But things could have turned out worse, she said -- Azamat's uncle, who was abducted by masked men in August 2002 and has never been heard from since.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Musleem is a dying breed of Chechen rebel -- he speaks flawless Russian, can recite Pushkin by heart and speaks fondly of ethnic Russian friends from university. Five years after war began again in Chechnya, the average rebel is more like the young men Musleem shuttles between safehouses -- stumbling through Russian, with rudimentary (if any) education and happy to see most Russians through the viewfinder of a Kalashnikov rifle. This bodes ill for Moscow, observers warn -- as the Kremlin's second war against Chechen rebels enters its sixth year, Russia is running out of people with whom it can make peace. "We're losing not just the republic, but the people," a top Kremlin aide with intimate knowledge of Chechnya admitted to reporters last week. "Moscow is not using its brains, ruling out all talks" with separatists, Musleem, a 40-something who is in charge of support for several hundred rebel fighters, told AFP recently in Chechnya. "People like (former Chechen president and rebel leader Aslan) Maskhadov and me can relate to Russians, we can talk with them. Once we are gone, they'll have to deal with them," he said, nodding at two young 20-something fighters nearby. "And that will be much more difficult." Chechen rebels today -- figures vary between 1,000 to 5,000, depending on the source -- are ready for evermore chilhis real name not be used) is a sign of things to come -- an arm-carrying rebel who works in the law enforcement agencies of its pro-Moscow government. In July Aslan received an offer he couldn't refuse -- the security service headed by Ramzan Kadyrov, the son of the slain Chechen leader Akhmad and the republic's deputy prime minister, offered to take him under its wing. Today the 31-year-old freely walks about the streets of Grozny, where he wouldn't have dared to step in May. "Now I legally carry arms and the Russians can't touch me," he told AFP recently, smiling. "It's now even easier for me to kill the occupiers. And make no mistake -- my goal is still for them to leave."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The war in Chechnya enters its sixth year Frida. Feb 29: Russian forces seize Shatoi, the last major rebel stronghold in the southern mountains. June 8: Putin places Chechnya under direct presidential administration and names former rebel leader Akhmad Kadyrov, a mufti who once called for a holy war against Moscow, as the leader of the pro-Russian administration. 2001 Jan 22: Putin gives the FSB security services, the former KGB, control of operations in Chechnya. April 14: Putin makes his first visit to Chechnya since his election in March. July: Russian prosecutors open an inquiry into a suspected "abuse of power" by Russian forces, as Putin acknowledges "irregularities" and "abuses" by the army. Nov 19: First direct talks between envoys from Putin and Maskhadov, but the negotiations end without result. Dec 30-Jan 1: More than 200 killed in a Russian operation east of Grozny. 2002 Aug 19: A Russian Mi-26 helicopter is shot down by rebels, killing 121 people. Oct 24: Rebels take hundreds of people hostage in a Moscow theatre and demand an end to Russian military operations in Chechnya. A total of 130 civilians and 41 Chechen guerrillas die in the rescue operation, most from a deadly gas that Russian forces pumped into the theater. Dec 27: About 80 people are killed when rebels drive two explosives-packed vehicles into the Chechen administration headquarters, destroying Russia's symbolic seat of power there. 2003 March 26: Nearly 90 percent of people in Chechnya vote in favour of rule from Moscow in a referendum even though hopes of ending the decade-long separatist conflict appear as remote as ever. April 2: The Council of Europe calls for the creation of an international tribunal to try war crimes committed in Chechnya. May 14: A suicide attack on a government building in Chechnya kills 60 people, one of the deadliest single attacks since conflict between separatist rebels and federal troops broke out. May 16: Anot an overnight raid against police targets in the capital Grozny a week before elections to replace Akhmad Kadyrov, killing some 50 police officers and up to 20 civilians, according to police sources. Aug 29: Interior Minister Alu Alkhanov wins an election to replace Akhmad Kadyrov, getting more than 73 percent of the controversial vote. Sept 1: Armed separatists take some 1,200 chilren, teachers and parents at a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, and demand that Moscow withdraw troops from nearby Chechnya. The siege ends two days later in a chaotic shootout that kills at least 344 people, half of them children, and 31 rebels. The attack is later claimed by radical Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ANKARA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[When hundreds of women marched on parliament last month against plans to criminalize adultery, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was so angry he called them "marginals" who do not represent the true Turkish woman. Days later, women scored a major victory in this male-dominated, Muslim society: yielding to European Union pressure, Erdogan's government dropped plans to jail errant spouses and rushed through parliament a reform package that introduced ground-breaking rights for women. "It is a triumph for us, a great leap forward," said Hulya Gulbahar, one of the leaders of a platform of women activists who fought a fierce battle for the amendments to the penal code reform. Turkish women have been part of the political life since the founding father of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, granted them suffrage rights in 1934, years before women in France, Italy, Belgium, Greece and Switzerland, for instance, were allowed to vote. In urban areas they are today emancipated to the point of claiming jobs as football referees and fighter pilots. The majority, however, is still in the grip of die-hard patriarchal traditions that, in some regions, go as far as to approve "honor killings" -- the murder of female family members perceived as unvirtuous. The women's movement in the country has grown stronger over the years, but discriminatory provisions enshrined in outdated laws came under the spotlight only after the EU warned Turkey that gender equality was as crucial to its membership bid as political issues. "The EU process had an accelerating impact," Gulbahar said. "We would expect the EU to make even clearer reminders to the government in the future." Among other amendments, the new penal code introduced life terms for perpetrators of "honor killings," criminalized spouse rape, defined systematic domestic violence as a kind of torture and toughened penalties for incest. It also weeded out from the books an infamous article that allowed rapists to go unpunished if they agreed to marry their victim. For some activists, however, the changes are just a small part of the job. "The problem in our region is that people do not respect the official laws," said Nebahat Akkoc from Diyarbakir, the biggest city of the mainly Kurdish southeast. "We have to change mentalities and ensure that the laws are implemented." A former primary school teacher, Akkoc is a genuine taboo-breaker -- she is the founder and head of a women's center which has rebelled against the "honor killings" that plague the region where feudal traditions still prevail, and where 55 perant." Although they succeeded in imposing most of their demands in the new penal code, women's groups have vowed to fight on for a few other amendments they failed to have enacted. Among them: a total ban on virginity tests, once ordered on women almost at will by any authority and now subject to court order.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A suspected suicide bomb blast ripped through a Shiite Muslim mosque during Friday prayers in the eastern Pakistani city of Sialkot, killing at least 19 people and leaving dozens injured, police said. Hundreds of worshippers were packed into the Mistri Abdullah Imambargah mosque in the city center when the huge explosion tore through the building, police spokesman Mohammad Ihsanullah told AFP. An intelligence official said 19 people were killed and more than 30 injured in the attack. "We believe the bomber carried the explosive into the mosque in a briefcase which he detonated while sitting amongst the worshippers and also blew himself up," the official, who could not be identified told AFP. "It is an act of terrorism which has claimed 16 lives and injured around 40 people," city police chief Nisar Ahmed earlier told AFP. "We believe a suicide bomber carried out the dastardly attack at a time when hundreds of worshippers were present inside the mosque for Friday's prayers," Ahmed said. Ahmed said several hundred angry protesters poured onto the streets outside the mosque after the blast and clashed with police. Witnesses said body parts and blood were spattered across the interior of the mosque, and that the explosion left a large crater and caused extensive damage to the mosque building. "We were hearing th arrests since July. The most notable were Pakistani computer expert Naeem Noor Khan and Tanzanian Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, who has been indicted by a US court for his role in the twin bombing of American embassies in East Africa in 1998. Musharraf, who threw his support behind the US "war on terror" after the September 11 attacks, said this month he was making significant inroads into breaking the Al-Qaeda network and that over 600 Al-Qaeda suspects had been detained.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BO WATERSIDE, Liberia, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Dozens of Liberians streamed back across the border from Sierra Leone Friday as part of a UN effort to return some 400,000 people home from around west Africa after 14 years of war. Gospel chants and clapping carried the convoy from Tobanda and Gondoma refugee camps in eastern Sierra Leone along its three-day journey to Zimmi, where the group of 78 people, mostly women and children, crossed the Mano River bridge into Liberia. On arrival, the refugees would undergo medical screening and be offered a package of food and non-food items including a sleeping mat, a plastic jerrican and various toiletries to take with them to their villages, which many of them have not seen in more than a decade. Of the roughly 300,000 Liberians who fled their country during back-to-back civil wars that erupted in 1989, some 67,000 Liberians are scattered around Sierra Leone. Another 100,000 are in other countries, such as Ghana and Nigeria, both of which have committed to assist the voluntary repatriation effort launched Friday by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Twice-weekly convoys are expected to ford the Bo Waterside crossing that has become a symbol for the war-ravaged neighbors -- first of despair and now of hope that peace will finally prevail after years of conflict. Tens of thousands of Liberians have flooded back into the country on their own since peace was declared in August last year, arriving to find their homes burned to the ground and their communities stripped bare of even essentials such as hand pumps for drinking water. The UNHCR-assisted refugees, who will spend as little time as possible in transit camps before being escorted to their home communities, are unlikely to have a warmer welcome as cash-strapped humanitarian agencies have warned of the possibility of food shortages. Also of concern is the volatility that has prevented UN peacekeepers from declaring the whole of Liberia safe for the returning refugees as well as the more than 500,000 people who crowded into Monrovia during the heaviest fighting in the rebel war to oust former president Charles Taylor. The country is simply "not ready" to absorb them, aid workers have said, claiming security considerations have been politicized by officials eager to have tangible results before the end of the year so as to encourage donors to make good on promises of 560 million dollars offered in February. It was at Bo Waterside that the last of an estimated 60,000 Sierra Leoneans who took refuge in Liberia crossed back into Sierra Leone in July, ending the UN effort to repatriate them after a decade-long war in their country forced them into exile. The refugee repatriation effort for northern neighbor Guinea is set to begin in November, and UN and humanitarian officials hope it will quell the tensions building up in the forested border region where most of the 150,000 Liberian refugees live in camps. Observers on both sides of the border have noted an intense recruitment drive among the refugees, some of them former combatants, possibly to get them to up arms to oust ailing Guinean President Lansana Conte. No date has been set to begin the return of 75,000 Liberians who are still in Ivory Coast, many of whom were targeted during a rash of xenophobic violence that flared in that country's west during a civil war that broke out in September 2002 and is still simmering two years later.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JABALIYA, Gaza Strip, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[At least six Palestinians were killed on Friday in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip, just hours after around 100 Israeli tanks moved deep into the area to try to stop militant rocket attacks on Israel. The latest campaign, which began three days ago and in which 44 Palestinians and five Israelis have died, intensified after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon gave a green light to a larger operation codenamed "Days of Penitence". Troops readied to take control of a six-kilometre (four-mile) deep buffer zone in the northern Gaza Strip to keep militants and rockets away from targets in southern Israel, just across the border, an official told AFP on Friday. Two Israeli children were killed in a rocket attacks on Sderot town on the second day of the offensive. The official, a close aide to Sharon, said the operation could broaden and "be more aggressive" if militant rocket attacks continue. Thirty-five tanks were seen entering Beit Hanun, while another 30 were seen pushing into Beit Lahiya and 30 more spotted moving into the eastern sector of Jabaliya, all in northern Gaza, local residents said. Israel's security cabinet Thursday approved a broadening of the operation, which it said was open-ended but would not be "a permanent occupation". Members of the security cabinet have been allegedly pressing for the army to carry out a second "Defensive Shield-style" operation in the Gaza Strip, Israeli radio said. Launched in March 2002, that operation saw the army reoccupy most of the West Bank in a bid to detain Palestinian militants and end a spate of suicide bombings. But the Sharon aide speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity on Friday said that the means put at the army's disposal in the current raid were "consequent" but "not yet comparable to those used during Operation Defensive Shield." He said that Operation Day of Penitence would be limited only "if it quickly fulfills its objective to completely stop rocket fire." "The activity in Gaza has one clear overriding aim -- to prevent the firing of Qassam rockets at Sderot and the firing of mortar shells at Jewish settlements in Gaza," Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said while meeting troops about to be deployed in the northern Gaza Strip "This activity will take time -- it's not easy, it's complex," he warned. Rockets are mostly fired by the hardline Hamas group and named 'Qassams' after its armed wing, the Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades. They have a 10-kilometre (six-mile) range and can carry a five-kilogramme (11-pound) charge. The decision to intensify the raid came after one of the bloodiest days in the four-year-old Palestinian intifada, or uprising. Five of Friday's Palestinian victims died in two air raids on Jabaliya refugee camp, sources on both sides said. Two were militants of the hardline Hamas movement. An army spokeswoman they were about to fire a Qassam rocket. Palestinian witnesses said an unmanned plane had fired on the Hamas men. Medics said at least 14 people had been wounded in the two air strikes and that a third one, also on Jabaliya, had wounded another person. A sixth Palestinian was killed by Israeli gunfire when he and another six militants took over a Palestinian police position south of the Erez border crossing, between the northern Gaza Strip and Israel, military sources said. The sources said troops approached the position and returned fire when one of the militants shot in their direction. They said the militants were in possession of a 30-kilogram (66-pound) of explosive charge. The latest casualties brought the overall death toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising four years ago to 4,399, including 3,375 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A suspected suicide bomb blast which killed at least 19 people at a Shiite Muslim mosque Friday is the latest in a wave of killings in Pakistan, plagued by sectarian violence and attacks on Western and official targets. Here is a chronology of significant attacks in Pakistan this year. January 15: Grenades are hurled at a Bible Society library in Karachi and a car bomb explodes 20 minutes later injuring 13 people, mainly police who were drawn to the scene by the first explosion. March 2: At least 48 people are killed and 150 hurt in the southwestern city Quetta when a suicide bomber blows himself up during a Shiite Muslim parade and gunmen open fire on the procession. March 15: Pakistani police narrowly prevent a huge car bomb exploding outside the US consulate in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, when they find around 650 litres of chemical explosives, a timer and two detonators in a van left outside the building. April 4: Five policemen and an attacker are killed when unidentified gunmen open fire on a police station in Karachi, also hitting an adjacent mosque. May 3: A car bomb kills three Chinese engineers helping to build a multi-million dollar seaport in southwestern Pakistan and injures 11 others including two Pakistanis. May 7: A suicide bombing during Friday prayers at a packed Shiite Muslim mosque in Karachi kills 23 people and wounds some 100. May 26: Two successive bomb blasts outside the US consul general's home and the Pakistan American Cultural Center kill a police guard and injure 32 police and local journalists. May 31: Twenty-two people are killed and nearly 40 injured after a suicide bomber blows up a Shiite mosque in Karachi during evening prayers. The attack comes a day after the assassination of prominent pro-Taliban Sunni cleric in the same area. Two people are killed in riots over the mosque attack and the Sunni cleric's assassination. June 10: Gunmen open fire on a convoy carrying the army commander of Karachi, killing seven soldiers, three policemen and a pedestrian but missing the senior general. July 30: A suicide car bomb attack targets prime minister-designate Shaukat Aziz after he addresses an election rally in a town west of Islamabad. He survives but his driver and eight others, including the attacker, are killed. Around 30 other people, including seven policemen, are injured. Oct 1: A suspected suicide bomb blast rips through a Shiite Muslim mosque during Friday prayers in the eastern city of Sialkot, killing at least 19 people and leaving dozens injured.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BOMBAY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indian share prices closed up 1.64 percent Friday at a fresh five-month high after robust three months to June growth figures, dealers said. The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensex rose 91.93 points to close at 5,675.54. Investors remained buoyed by Thursday's announcement that quarterly growth touched 7.4 percent, despite a slowdown in agriculture. Dealers said the market also grew on a report in The Economic Times newspaper that Indian companies were planning 100 billion dollars of investment in the next few years. "It was an all-round effect as a series of positive news is influencing the sentiment," a dealer with a foreign brokerage said. The stock market rose 73 percent in 2003 on the back of blistering economic growth triggered by farm output after the best monsoon in a decade. But in May the bourse plunged after a communist-backed government took power amid fears that the new focus on the poor and away from privatisation would push down growth. "These perceptions are now clearly being brushed off and investors are back to believe that the Indian growth story continues," said Anish Marfatia, vice president at Parag Parekh Advisory. Leading the rally Friday was consumer goods giant Reliance after a report the company was about to sign a deal with a foreign investor to sell a stake in its telecommunication business. Reliance closed up 2.91 percent or 15.10 rupees at 533.30. Cement major ACC rose 3.03 percent or 8.10 rupees at 275, software maker Satyam gained 2.82 percent or 10.65 at 388.05, State Bank was up 2.29 percent or 10.75 rupees at 478.95 and Oil and Natural Gas was up 3.90 percent or 29.25 rupees at 777.80. Glenmark Pharmaceutical ended down 6.48 percent or 20.70 rupees at 298.60, after surging in the past week on a deal to market an asthma drug on the US market.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman said Friday Washington would contribute 9.5 million dollars toward the implementation of a controversial law on decentralisation in the Balkan country. "We believe that this task should be completed for Macedonia to follow its vision for a multiethnic society, democracy, the EU and NATO," Grossman said after meeting President Branko Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Hari Kostov. "We intend to continue to support the people of Macedonia as it moves toward European structures." The EU-backed law to change municipal boundaries in favour of ethnic Albanians sparked violent protests from the ethnic Macedonian majority when it was adopted in August. Opposition parties claim it is a first step toward federalism and the possible break-up of the former Yugoslav republic and have gathered enough signatures to force a referendum on the issue. The vote is due to take place in November. Earlier on Friday EU Commission President Romano Prodi, during a separate visit to Skopje to kick-start EU accession talks, said the law was vital to Macedonia's future relations with the bloc.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LISBON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The European Commission has launched legal action against Portugal for failing to enforce laws regulating the disposal of old refrigerators and air conditioning units containing ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), enviromentalists said Friday. Quercus, a leading Portuguese environmental group, said it received a letter from the EU Environment Commission last month informing the group that Brussels was opening a probe into complaints that Lisbon has not provided sufficient CFC recycling facilities. The group complained to Brussels last year that only 0.5 percent of roughly 500,000 old CFC-containing equipments were disposed of properly in Portugal in 2002. EU regulations require member states to remove all CFCs from all old refrigerators and air conditioning units at recycling plants but Quercus said in Portugal the vast majority continued to be dumped directly into the garbage. "The EU has looked into our complaint, they found it valid and have opened legal action against Portugal," the president of Quercus, Helder Spinola, told AFP. Lisbon now faces a stiff fine from the EU for not doing enough to ensure the rules on the proper disposal of CFCs, he added. Previously used as a refrigerant, CFCs have been proved to deplete the ozone layer which shields the earth from the sun's harmful radiation, increasing the number of skin cancers and contributing to global warming.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The UN refugee chief Ruud Lubbers on Friday called on European Union interior ministers meeting in the Netherlands to reaffirm their commitment to protecting refugees "both within the EU and beyond". Speaking by video link from his office in Geneva, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Lubbers told the ministers that asylum seekers who reached Europe should have their claims heard in Europe, the UNHCR said in a statement. However, tacitly referring to the mass arrival of boatloads of asylum seekers in Italy, the UNHCR added: "There have to be credible alternatives to a dangerous sea crossing and information about these alternatives needs to be available". Germany and Italy are due to put forward their proposal to set up asylum camps on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in North Africa during the EU meeting in the Dutch resort of Scheveningen. Britain made similar proposals last year for camps overseas, hinting that some asylum seekers who had already reached Europe could be transferred there until their claims were processed. But other countries, led by the Scandinavians, raised objections on human rights grounds. Lubbers also reiterated a call for member states to avoid the "lowest standards" allowed under a new EU asylum directive, and for a more harmonious approach to asylum among the 25 nations in "a truly European space for refugees". The former Dutch prime minister also appealed to ministers to avoid a "eurocentric approach", stressing the need for more cooperation and dialogue with countries in North Africa and the Middle East, UNHCR said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Italian sports doctor Michele Ferrari, who has worked with several top cyclists including six-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, has been given a 12-month suspended jail sentence for malpractice by a court here, legal sources said on Friday. However Ferrari, the former doctor of cycling team Refin, was acquitted of distributing doping products which could endanger health. He is appealing the sentence. Filippo Simeoni, one of Ferrari's main accusers and currently in Verona for the world road race championships, said: "From a human point of view, I regret Ferrari's sentence but it shows my statements were justified and that there is justice in this world. You just have to be patient." He continued: "Everyone knew what was going on but no one said anything. But I spoke out and I am happy that my comments finally bore fruit, especially after the attacks from Lance Armstrong and other cyclists." Just 10 days ago, Italian prosecutor Lorenzo Gestri recommended a 14-month prison sentence for Ferrari for administering performance-enhancing substances to cyclists. Armstrong told Le Figaro newspaper in an interview in January last year he worked on a daily basis with his full-time coach Chris Carmichael but had a periodic but limited six-year collaboration with Ferrari.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Microsoft appeals against EU order to strip down Windows by Emma Davis.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LUXEMBOURG, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US software giant Microsoft insisted Friday that nobody would want to buy its Windows operating system without Media Player, in an appeal against an EU ruling that it had abused its market dominance. On the second day of a hearing before the EU Court of First Instance, the software titan said that users did not want a stripped-down version of its all-conquering system. The European Commision, the EU's executive arm, ruled in March that the company had to offer a version of its operating system Windows without its Media Player software, which offers access to audio and video content. The Brussels commission also required Microsoft to provide competitors with the information they needed to enable their products to communicate with Windows. Brussels also fined Microsoft nearly half a billion euros (dollars). The money has been paid into an escrow account, meaning it is held in trust and neither Microsoft nor the commission has access while the appeal is pending. Microsoft has dubbed the version of Windows without Media Player "A6" since it is the result of article six of the EU's decision. But company lawyer Jean-Francois Bellis told the Luxembourg court: "There is no rationale that end-users would take A6." "This is the first time the commission challenged the right of how a dominant company designs its own product," he said. He added: "This would not just be new law, it would be bad law." The company claims that media functionality, which will necessarily be stripped out of the operating system together with the media player, is an integral part of an operating system. Microsoft called various experts to support its case, arguing that removal of the functionality will create confusion for software developers and web content providers. Microsoft's rivals are fiercely opposed to any suspension of the measures ordered against it. They argue that such a ruling would open the way for Microsoft to extend its dominance further. "You've already seen them eliminate competition on the browser market," said CCIA lawyer Thomas Vinje, arguing that the bundling of software like Media Player is "the most anti-competitive weapon Microsoft has employed." He notably voiced concern that, after audio and video software, Microsoft could use its dominance to similar effect for example in the mobile telephony software market. Microsoft, while hoping for a positive ruling, is also prepared for the worst, its chief lawyer said before the Luxembourg hearing began. "We obviously think that having to comply really would cause great harm not only to us as a company but to great many others in our industry. But nonetheless if we're ordered to comply we'll be in the position to to do so." The court president Bo Vesterdorf was set to question both sides on their arguments concerning the removal of media player. He is expected to hand down his decision in four to six weeks.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A journalist missing for more than a month in the rebel-held northern zone of Ivory Coast has been taken by the rebels, the national journalists union in the west African state said Friday. "Corroborating credible sources have told us that Amadou Dagnogo is in the hands of the rebels in their stronghold in Bouake," the National Union of Ivory Coast Journalists (UNJCI) said in a statement, demanding his "immediate, unconditional release." Dagnogo, a freelance journalist employed by the independent daily L'Inter since May to cover events in the central town of Bouake, has not contacted his editors in more than a month. In a statement released Wednesday, the daily noted that he had been targeted for verbal abuse by the leadership of the rebel movement that has controlled Ivory Coast's north since a failed coup in September 2002. Rebel spokesman Antoine Beugre released a statement Thursday denying there had been any harassment of Dagnogo and rejected the notion of foul play. The union demanded that the government take immediate action to locate Dagnogo and to protect its members from the "continual harassment they suffer while working in the rebel zone." International media watchdog Reporters without Borders (RSF) has also expressed concern about Dagnogo's disappearance. "Whatever happened to Amadou Dagnogo, the menacing language used by the rebel leadership is unacceptable," RSF said in a statement released Wednesday. Local and foreign correspondents are routinely subject to harassment on both sides of the confidence zone that is patrolled by thousands of French and UN peacekeepers. Radio France International correspondent Jean Helene was killed at point blank range in October last year by a police sergeant. Independent journalist Guy-Andre Kieffer disappeared from the main city Abidjan in April and has not been heard from since. High-ranking members of the government of President Laurent Gbagbo have been implicated in his disappearance, despite vigorous denials.]]></c>

Millwall chairman Theo Paphitis said he had feared for his safety as people sitting in a VIP area were bombarded with coins and other objects. The English club will also demand that UEFA act over the racist barracking of their black players Paul Ifil and Mark McCammon. "Even as a kid I cannot remember it being as bad as that. It was like going back into the dismal time of football that we all try to forget," Paphitis said. Millwall have made huge efforts to eradicate a hooligan and racist element from their own support and Paphitis said the 3,000 fans who travelled to Hungary should not be blamed for the violent incidents. A total of four Millwall fans were stabbed in pre-match clashes, according to the British Foreign Office. The most seriously injured fan was admitted to intensive care but was no longer in a life-threatening condition by Friday morning, according to doctors treating him at a Budapest hospital. Around 60 Millwall and Ferencvaros fans clashed in downtown Budapest, with riot squads using tear gas to restore order. After the match, which Ferenvaros won 3-1 to advance to the group stage of the competition, there were also clashes between Hungarian and Czech supporters who had apparently been attracted to Budapest by the prospect of trouble. A total of 12 fans were taken into custody on Thursday -- eight Hungarians, two British, and two Czechs.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Arsene Wenger has told Wayne Rooney he will have to live "like a monk" if he is to make the most of his phenomenal talent. The 18-year-old's stunning debut for Manchester United in midweek came as no surprise to the Arsenal manager, who has previously described Rooney as the most exciting young English player he had seen. But he also underlined that the forward, who has already had to contend with revelations about his fondness for backstreet brothels, would have to learn how to sidestep the potential pitfalls as effortlessly as he swerves past defenders. "Rooney could be another George Best, I have no doubt," Wenger said. "England is in need of a big, big star and he has what you need from that player - he comes from Liverpool, he is working-class and he has exceptional talent. "But football is a high-level sport and you must live the life of a monk. You have a ritual - you go training, you sleep, you prepare. There is only one thing to be answered - how much do you love to play the game. If you have that love then you can easily sacrifice the rest." United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has a good track record of keeping young stars focused on their jobs, not least by keeping tabs on their activities through an extensive network of contacts in the Manchester area. But Wenger believes it will be down to Rooney to ensure he makes the most of his talent. "All managers can only help those who want to be successful," the Frenchman said. "If he doesn't want to live seriously and wants to drink, he can do it at home and arrange things at home. However, I feel that Rooney has a real love for the game. Would I like to work with Wayne Rooney. Who wouldn't want to work with him. We all like to work with exceptional talent." Arsneal go into Saturday's Highbury clash with Charlton looking to extend their unbeaten run in the Premiership to 48 games after a disappointing Champions League draw with Rosenborg on Wednesday that was followed by a scuffle between skipper Patrick Vieira and defender Lauren. Charlton have a record of giving the Gunners problem and Wenger admitted his side needed to step up from the level of their midweek display. "Charlton never give anything but their all at Highbury and they have shown in their last two matches against Birmingham and Blackburn that they regained their defensive stability," he said. "We are under pressure in every game now and we are ready for that." Dennis Bergkamp is expected to return to the Arsenal line-up at the expense of Jose Antonio Reyes, who looked distinctly jaded in midweek.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair underwent surgery Friday to correct an irregular heartbeat, a day after announcing that he intends to serve a full third term if re-elected. With his wife Cherie at his side, Blair checked into Hammersmith Hospital in west London for a relatively routine operation to restore his heart rhythm, called a catheter ablation, that will require only local anesthetic. Asked how he felt as he left Downing Street, his official residence, Blair -- who underwent a different procedure for the same problem in October last year -- waved, smiled and replied: "Fine." A few hours later, sources told Sky News television that the operation was completed, and that Blair was in good condition. "It's not particularly alarming, but it's something that you should get fixed. It's a routine procedure," said Blair in a television interview Thursday in which he disclosed the operation. "I've had it for the last couple of months, and it's not impeded me doing my work and feeling fine, but it is as well to get it done." Beyond his heart problem, Blair used the interview to drop a political bombshell -- that he intends to serve "a full third term", but no more, if his Labour Party wins the next general election. If the election comes next year, as many expect, that means Blair -- who led Labour to power in 1997 and 2001, and who has never been so unequivocal about his long-term plans -- could be prime minister until as late as 2010. "The decision as to who is the prime minister of the country is the decision of the British people. They're the boss," he told BBC television. "But if I am elected, I would serve a full third term," he said. "I do not want to serve a fourth term. I don't think the British people would want a prime minister to go on that long, but I think it's sensible to make plain my intention now." Blair was due to be discharged from hospital later Friday, then rest over the weekend before he leaves London later next week for an official visit to Ethiopia. One of Britain's leading cardiologists, Andrew Grace of Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, eastern England, said the procedure Blair was undergoing Friday has a high success rate. "It is very safe, effective and well tolerated procedure to cure these sorts of issues," he told BBC radio, adding that his own hospital will do about 500 such procedures next year with a 95 percent success rate. Blair's double-barreled announcement about his hospital treatment and his intention to stay on and complete a third term was carefully timed. It came just hours after the close of Labour's annual conference, where Blair sought to heal lingering splits over the Iraq war, of Britain's expatriate Arab community.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Trouble in Niger Delta dampens Nigeria's independence anniversary by Ade Obisesan.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LAGOS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Trouble in Nigeria's Niger Delta, hub of the country's lucrative oil industry, along with incidents of deadly religious and ethnic unrest put a damper on the west African nation's 44th independence anniversary. "As we celebrate the 44th independence anniversary on a low key, let us pray for our country", President Olusegun Obasanjo said in his nationwide address on Friday. Obasanjo also admitted he is holding talks in Abuja with the rebels of the oil-rich Niger Delta region where unrest since August have claimed around 500 lives, according to an Amnesty International report. The Nigeria Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), led by Mujahid Dokubo Asari, is demanding the convening of conv to foreign oil workers to quit the region, the hub of multimillion-dollar oil operations. "Nigeria has drifted into abject poverty and anguish. Our leaders are cornering our resources to our collective detriment. There is no hope of a brighter tomorrow," Goodluck Ellah, a 44-year-old civil servant in Port Harcourt, said. "With all these troubles in Niger Delta and Nigeria, there is nothing to celebrate about Nigeria's independence. The poverty in Niger Delta which has given rise to armed violence needs to be urgently addressed by government," Grace Sodienye, 17, a student in the oil city said. In November 1999, barely six months after Obasanjo came into office, he sent troops to quell an unrest in Odi, a town in region, following the killing of a dozen policemen. Hundreds of people were shot dead in the army invasion. Zaki Biam and some other towns in central Benue State were almost completely annihilated by the army three years ago in a reprisal attack after some soldiers were abducted and killed by local militias. Last May, Obasanjo deposed the elected civilian governor of central Plateau State and dissolved the state parliament following ethnic and religious unrest in some parts of the state which claimed hundreds of lives. Obasanjo imposed a state of emergency, suspended the governor, Joshua Dariye, and the parliament for a renewable period of six months and appointed a former army chief, Chris Alli, as administrator of the state. "These are signs of instability. There is nothing to celebrate. We are instead mourning because we have never had this level of poverty, hopelessness and disillusionment," Fawehinmi said. In Lagos, Nigeria's economic capital, and other major cities, there were no visible signs of celebration of the independence anniversary.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[China vowed to move "firmly and steadily" toward a flexible exchange rate during a meeting of Chinese and US officials in Washington Thursday, the US Treasury Department said in a statement released Friday. The Chinese delegation, led by Finance Minister Jin Renqing, "reaffirmed China's commitment to further advance reform and to push ahead firmly and steadily to a market-based flexible exchange rate, and described the steps the Chinese government has taken to create conditions to establish a more flexible exchange rate," the statement said. The United States and its G7 partners had maintained that the Chinese currency, pegged to a weak dollar, makes foreign goods too expensive -- and thereby less competitive -- in China, while leaving Chinese exports unfairly cheap in foreign markets. Some analysts have said a free-floating yuan could boost US exports and thereby help reduce Washington's massive current account deficit, which IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato has characterized as a threat to the world economy. Rato had said earlier that China should take advantage of a growth rate expected to hit nine percent this year to allow greater flexibility in its exchange rate mechanism.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ABIDJAN, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Ivory Coast, producer of 40 percent of the world's cocoa, boosted annual exports to 1.34 million tonnes, President Laurent Gbagbo said Friday, expressing confidence that the new season would yield a similar increase. The boost marks a 35,000 tonne increase over exports in 2003, amid a campaign that unfurled under pressure from the low-level conflict that has strafed the west African state for the last two years. In announcing the increase, Gbagbo was confident that the new campaign, opening this month would yield even greater results. Cocoa cycles run from October to March, during which time 80 percent of the annual harvest of the fragrant beans is produced. A second, intermediary harvest in May and June produces between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes ahead of the new season. Some six million of Ivory Coast's 17 million people make their living directly or indirectly from the 620,000 smallholder cocoa plantations around the country. Coffee and cocoa exports bring in 40 percent of Ivory Coast's revenues and represent 20 percent of its gross national product of 12.2 billion euros annually, according to the International Monetary Fund. The political instability in Ivory Coast since a failed coup plunged the country into war has forced nearly one-third of the growers off their plantations for fear of attack. Cocoa farmers have taken to the streets of the main city Abidjan in recent months, decrying the shoddy management of the sector which they say has driven prices down and growers into poverty.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi chided an opposition lawmaker Friday for suggesting a car-burning protest by a right-winger should have been directed at his office, not parliament. A 54-year-old man steered a burning sedan to a roadblock outside a service entrance to the House of Representative building Thursday, protesting against what he sees as Japan's soft stance towards Stalinist North Korea. The driver was arrested on the spot for arson after emerging from the car unhurt. Yoshito Sengoku, the policy chief of the main opposition Democratic Party, told reporters late Thursday: "If he is dissatisfied with the government's stance, he should have targeted the Prime Minister's Office or the Cabinet Office." Koizumi on Friday said Sengoku sounded as if he was suggesting the lone protester should have rammed his car into the premier's office. "He'd better not be seen to be promoting terrorism," Koizumi told reporters at his office, located some 200 metres (yards) away from the protest site. "There is freedom of expression, freedom of speech in democracy. Anyone can criticise government," Koizumi said. Sengoku complained on Friday that his words had been taken out of context. The car driver identified himself as Mitsuyoshi Hasegawa and a former leader of a rightist organisation. Hasegawa was protesting against the slow progress Japan is making in pushing North Korea to reveal full details of its abductions of Japanese during the Cold War years, police said. North Korea admitted in 2002 that its agents kidnapped Japanese to use them for spy training. It has allowed five survivors among the kidnap victims to return home, with their families in the North joining them later in Japan. But slow progress in investigating the cases of 10 other abductees is stalling talks on normalising relations and hampering Japan's full-scale economic aid to the impoverished state.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Turkey scraps gathering after row with EU over Turkish Cypriots (ADDS reax, details).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ISTANBUL, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Turkey said Friday it had scrapped talks in Istanbul next week between the European Union and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) amid a row with Brussels over the participation of Turkish Cypriots officials. The spat came as an unpleasant episode just days before the release of an October 6 report on Turkey's progress towards EU membership, widely expected to be a favorable one. The report will form the basis for a December 17 decision by EU leaders on whether to start accession talks with Turkey. The cancellation of the talks followed a call on EU members by the Dutch presidency to boycott the meeting after Turkey inisted on calling the breakaway Turkish Cypriot enclave a "state" at the gathering, the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. "The decision of the EU presidency not to participate and the appeal it made to other member nations to follow suit. has resulted in the cancellation of this informal gathering of foreign ministers," the statement said. The meeting, which was scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, was intended to promote better ties and understanding between Europe and Muslim countries. The first such talks between the EU and the OIC were held in Istanbul in February 2002, in the wake of the September 11 attacks in the United States the previous year. "I'm surprised that Turkey is risking a new row with Europe in the middle of an important phase of its EU candidacy," a European diplomat told AFP on the condition of the anonymity. He described Turkey's attitude as "a remarkable example of amateurism ahead of the historical December 17 decision." At the heart of the row was a decision by the OIC in June to refer to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot community, which has an observer status in the pan-Islamic group, as "the Cypriot Turkish state," without formally recognizing it. The decision was a gesture to the Turkish Cypriots following the strong support they gave to a UN plan to end the 30-year division of Cyprus in an April referendum. The peace effort failed when the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot south of the island rejected the plan, ensuring that they alone joined the EU on May 1. The Greek Cypriots, backed by EU member Greece, are categorically opposed to any move that could imply recognition of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot statelet in the north, called the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Only Turkey recognizes the TRNC and keeps several thousands troops there. "We regret the fact that an important initiative, aimed at contributing to world peace by promoting dialogue between civilizations and cultures, has been prevented due to such an unessential reason," the foreign ministry said. "We would like to thank all those EU and OIC countries which had envisaged to take part on a high-level in the forum," it added. Turkey had assured EU countries that their participation in the gathering alongside the Turkish Cypriots would not amount to a recognition of the TRNC. Ankara, however, had rejected an EU formula to solve the problem under which representatives of observer nations would sit at the table without name plaques.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[How long for Blair. House purchase prompts the question by Robert MacPherson.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Tony Blair might want to be Britain's prime minister for the rest of the decade, but whether he will be able to is another matter -- and his decision to buy himself a luxury home suggests that he knows that. As commentators pointed out, most prime ministers leave office reluctantly, and buying a house would be an indicator of Blair preparing for life outside the corridors of power. and blood, tell another unavoidable story," he said. Indeed, Thatcher purchased a house in Dulwich, south London, so that she would have a roof over her head in the event that she was pushed out office -- which she was in 1991. Equally unclear is what Blair's long-term blueprint means for Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, widely seen as the prime minister's biggest rival within the Labour Party. Brown was in Washington for World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings when Blair made his bombshell announcement. "His thoughts will be with the prime minister throughout the weekend," a spokesman for Brown said, adding that the finance minister had sent Blair "a personal message of support". Brown remains the Labourite most likely to succeed Blair, but by 2010 he would be 59 years old, and there may well be younger political talent ready to challenge him over the party helm. Of course, Blair's own intentions hinge more than anything else on Labour actually winning the next British general election, likely to be held in May or June next year. The most recent opinion polls suggest that Labour can win a third straight term -- something it has never done in its history -- but with a reduced majority in parliament. If voter support for Labour slips over the winter, however, Blair could find himself leading a minority government -- if not suffering outright defeat -- and that could hasten his early retirement.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Frenchman presenting himself as an unofficial negotiator said in a telephone interview with a radio station Friday that he was with two French reporters who are being held hostage by insurgents in Iraq. Philippe Brett told the Europe 1 station by mobile telephone that he was currently in Iraq but would not say where exactly. When asked if he was was with Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France Internationale, both of whom were kidnapped August 20 along with their Syrian driver south of Baghdad on August 20, Brett said: "The response is yes." "I can't tell you any more. We are in the process of finalising things. I don't want to compromise this operation which is already sufficiently complicated as it is," he said. He added: "I think that within the next 10 hours or so, I'll be able to (talk to you) with a great deal of pleasure." The French government has said Brett was not in Iraq on its behalf, with the defence ministry notably stating that his statements were creating "more confusion than certainty". The foreign ministry sent a senior official to Jordan last Friday to make official efforts to secure the journalists' release. Brett has said he went to Iraq to negotiate with the journalists' abductors on behalf of a French parliamentary deputy, Didier Julia, who is a member of President Jacques Chirac's UMP party and vice-president of a Iraqi-French Friendship Group. Julia, an Arabic-speaker with ties to the Middle East, flew to Syria last Thursday to "explore new avenues" for extricating the journalists. His aides have said that the hostage-takers, a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq, wanted to free the two men but were being frustrated by US bombings in the Fallujah area.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TAIPEI, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Taiwan's top policymaker on China said Friday there were signs of reduced tensions across the Taiwan Strait as both sides took steps to promote civilian exchanges. "The tensions seem to be decreasing. we still see some tensions but at least we see statements coming from the Chinese side have been moderating," said Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council. After the re-election of pro-independence President Chen Shui-bian in March, Beijing stepped up its warnings against moves in Taiwan for formal independence from China, renewing long-standing threats to take the island by force. "We also see indications that the two sides seem to be improving the current situation right now," Wu said. Wu pointed to improved cross-strait cooperation in crime-fighting, with two of Taiwan's most-wanted fugitives recently extradited from China with the help of mainland police authorities. He added that the number of mainland tourists to Taiwan had been increasing and the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian was also considering visits to Taiwan's offshore Kinmen and Matzu islands. But Wu noted that military confrontation between the two sides continued with Beijing threatening the island with its rapid military build-up. Taiwan's defense ministry warns that China has some 600 ballistic missiles targeting the island. It is pressing ahead with a controversial 610.8 billion Taiwan dollars (18.02 billion US) arms procurement drive to beef up the island's self-defense against Chinese military threats. Wu said he hoped both sides could show some flexibility, despite their political differences, and allow talks to resume on issues such as direct communication links and tourism. China still views Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification despite their split in 1949.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Chirac proposes constitutional change for referendum on Turkish EU entry.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[STRASBOURG, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President Jacques Chirac further stirred debate over Turkish membership of the European Union Friday with a declaration that he favours a change to France's constitution in order to guarantee a national referendum to approve Ankara's accession. The president, who has said he is personally in favour of Turkey's eventual adhesion, was speaking after talks with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder that also focussed on the deteriorating security situation in Iraq and the next round of EU budget negotiations. "I have asked my government to examine ways of inserting (into the constitution) a text stipulating that after a certain date -- before Turkey's eventual membership -- the French public be compulsorily consulted on new admissions to the EU," he said. Chirac said that the clause -- which would be appended to the constitutional revision required by the adoption of the EU's new constitutional treaty -- would not apply to the next three member states, Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, which are expected to join in 2007. He also said it was not specifically aimed at Turkey -- though the issue of Turkish membership has become a subject of fervent debate ahead of a December decision from Brussels on whether to open accession talks, and senior members of Chirac's government have themselves called for a national referendum on the issue. Chirac's initiative was being seen as an attempt to separate the question of Turkish membership from the wider issue of the EU's new constitution, whose approval at a French referendum in the second half of next year is far from a foregone conclusion. According to an opinion poll this week, some 56 percent of the French public are opposed to Turkish entry with only 36 percent in favour, and the government fears the question will cloud debate in the run-up to the treaty referendum, making a no vote more likely. Repeating his view that Turkey's eventual admission to the European Union is to be welcomed, Chirac said it would nonetheless take between 10 and 15 years for the country to carry out the reforms required by Brussels. "We have an interest in having Turkey with us," Chirac said. "It opens the perspective of democracy and peace taking root on the whole of the European continent -- in the wider sense of the term -- so that we avoid the mistakes and violence of the past." "Turkey has made a considerable effort recently to bring its legislation, methods and practices in line with the EU. But these must advance still further before they respect the criteria on democracy and a market economy," the president said. Schroeder said he shared the French position on Turkish entry, which he described as a "plus for European security". Commentators said that the referendum proposal allows Chirac to defuse growing divisions within his ruling Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party over Turkish membership. Though the president supports the proposal "when the time is right," his main rival for the leadership of the centre-right -- Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy -- remains sceptical, as do Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and most of the UMP rank-and-file. Schroeder and Chirac also undertook to coordinate their positions on a proposed international conference on Iraq. Both countries support the idea, but Paris says it must discuss US withdrawal from Iraq and include members of the armed opposition.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[CORAL GABLES, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President George W. Bush and his Democratic rival John Kerry resumed their campaign trail Friday, with both camps claiming a winning performance in their first televised debate one month away from elections. Bush, who stoutly defended his strategy of going to war in Iraq which his Democratic rival Senator John Kerry called a "colossal error," will rally for votes in Allentown, Pennsylvania and Manchester, New Hampshire Friday. Kerry will press ahead with his campaign in crucial Florida state after a poll showed he did a better job in the first debate with Bush late Thursday ahead of the November 2 vote. A Gallup poll for CNN gave Kerry a 46 percent to 37 percent win over the president but the survey said Bush still had the support of 51 percent of voters against 47 percent for Kerry. The Massachusetts senator charged in the debate watched by tens of millions of viewers that Bush committed "a colossal error" by invading Iraq while the president countered that his rival was undermining US credibility in the war on terrorism with "mixed messages" about whether toppling Saddam Hussein was worth the cost. Iraq and national security dominated as the two candidates battled over how to stabilize that war-torn country, where more than 1,000 US soldiers have died amid deadly chaos that shows no sign of ebbing. The two also clashed on approaches to the North Korean nuclear crisis -- Bush warning against Kerry's call for bilateral talks -- and to Iran's moves to develop a nuclear program. But both agreed that the most serious threat to US national security was the possibility that terrorists like Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network might get their hands on nuclear materials. The New York Times said the debate ended with neither side making an obvious gaffe. "If Americans who tuned into last night's presidential debate were waiting for one of the candidates to catch the other in a fatal error, or leave him stammering, the event was obviously a draw," wrote The New York Times. The daily, however, gave Kerry points for looking presidential, keeping Bush on the defensive, arguing that Iraq had nothing to do with the war on terror and that Bush rushed into the war without an exit strategy. The Los Angeles Times presented its readers with what it believes is the real conundrum: "Kerry won Thursday night's debate on foreign policy by a comfortable margin, but Americans may yet decide that President Bush is better able to clean up the mess he created in Iraq." Bush's clarity in defining goals was not matched with candor about conditions on the ground in Iraq, the Washington Post said, adding Kerry was effective in stressing how the nuclear threat from North Korea and Iran has increased under Bush's watch. "Both performed credibly enough to keep voters tuned in for the next debate," concluded the Posinto Samarra, 125 kilometres (80 miles) north of Baghdad, in a first effort to reclaim troublespots before Iraq's planned elections. Iraq's hostage saga also showed no let-up, with two Indonesian women among the 10 latest people to be kidnapped. Al-Jazeera television said the two were seized along with six Iraqis and two Lebanese. The Samarra operation followed vows by the interim government to win back swathes of lawless territory in the Sunni Muslim triangle before November to prepare for the January poll.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BOLOGNA, Italy, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Italian sports doctor Michele Ferrari, who has worked with several top cyclists including six-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, has been given a 12-month suspended jail sentence for malpractice by a court here, legal sources said on Friday. However Ferrari, the former doctor of cycling team Refin, was acquitted of distributing doping products which could endanger health. Filippo Simeoni, one of Ferrari's main accusers and currently in Verona for the world road race championships, said: "From a human point of view, I regret Ferrari's sentence but it shows my statements were justified and that there is justice in this world. You just have to be patient." He continued: "Everyone knew what was going on but no one said anything. But I spoke out and I am happy that my comments finally bore fruit, especially after the attacks from Lance Armstrong and other cyclists." Just 10 days ago, Italian prosecutor Lorenzo Gestri recommended a 14-month prison sentence for Ferrari for administering performance-enhancing substances to cyclists. On leaving the court, Ferrari said: "I certainly did not expect this sentence because I am innocent of this whole affair." Ferrari's lawyer Dario Bolognesi said they would appeal and emphasised his client had been acquitted of the most serious charge of distributing doping products. "We will appeal. The most serious accusation has gone and the whole trial is linked to the interpretation of standards in doping and sporting fraud, and to the comments of rider Filippo Simeoni," Bolognesi said. Armstrong told Le Figaro newspaper in an interview in January last year he worked on a daily basis with his full-time coach Chris Carmichael but had a periodic but limited six-year collaboration with Ferrari.]]></c>

Repeating his view that Turkey's eventual admission to the European Union is to be welcomed, Chirac said it would nonetheless take between 10 and 15 years for the country to carry out the reforms required by Brussels. "We have an interest in having Turkey with us," Chirac said. "It opens the perspective of democracy and peace taking root on the whole of the European continent -- in the wider sense of the term -- so that we avoid the mistakes and violence of the past." "Turkey has made a considerable effort recently to bring its legislation, methods and practices in line with the EU. But these must advance still further before they respect the criteria on democracy and a market economy," the president said. Schroeder said he shared the French position on Turkish entry, which he described as a "plus for European security". Commentators said that the referendum proposal allows Chirac to defuse growing divisions within his ruling Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party over Turkish membership. Though the president supports the proposal "when the time is right," his main rival for the leadership of the centre-right -- Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy -- remains sceptical, as do Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and most of the UMP rank-and-file. Schroeder and Chirac also undertook to coordinate their positions on a proposed international conference on Iraq. Both countries support the idea, but Paris says it must discuss US withdrawal from Iraq and include members of the armed opposition.]]></c>

"China is an excellent business opportunity and should be seriously considered by Portuguese businessmen," Miguel Horta e Costa told newsweekly Sabado. "A company like Portugal Telecom must study with time and in detail all opportunities, but this is the moment to enter (the Chinese market)."

		<c><![CDATA[Matt Dawson's bid to reclaim his England place kicks off in earnest when the Wasps scrum-half faces his former club Northampton in a Premiership clash on Saturday. Dawson was axed from the England squad after missing a training session because of a prior commitment to filming BBC television programme, A Question of Sport. But he is determined to fight his way back into the international reckoning and extend an international career in which he has won 65 caps and featured in England's World Cup triumph last year. "I still want to play for England, and I will do my ut to it." Champions Wasps are without the services of a dozen injured players, including England quintet Josh Lewsey, Simon Shaw, Stuart Abbott, Will Green and Fraser Waters, although skipper Lawrence Dallaglio is back on starting XV duty after recovering from rib trouble. Leicester will equal the Premiership record of four successive victories with try bonus points if they claim four or more touchdowns against Jonny Wilkinson's Newcastle at Kingston Park on Saturday. "We don't want to be a 10-man team like the Leicester sides of old," said Tigers centre Daryl Gibson. "We've got a good back-line, and we should use it. The conditions weren't ideal against Northampton last week, but we still played rugby and threw the ball around. "We were expansive when Northampton were negative. We believe that we've got the players to break down negative teams." Tigers have mauled Leeds, London Irish and Northampton during the past three weeks, but Newcastle rugby director R on all 13 previous attempts.

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[China vowed to move "firmly and steadily" toward a flexible exchange rate during a meeting of Chinese and US officials in Washington Thursday, the US Treasury Department said in a statement released Friday. The Chinese delegation, led by Finance Minister Jin Renqing, "reaffirmed China's commitment to further advance reform and to push ahead firmly and steadily to a market-based flexible exchange rate, and described the steps the Chinese government has taken to create conditions to establish a more flexible exchange rate," the statement said. The statement also noted that the US delegation "expressed support for continued efforts by the Chinese government to bring about this goal as rapidly as possible." The United States and its G7 partners had maintained that the Chinese currency, pegged to a weak dollar, made foreign goods too expensive -- and thereby less competitive -- in China, while leaving Chinese exports unfairly cheap in foreign markets. They also complained that it caused US firms to move jobs overseas, a contentious issue ahead of the November 2 US presidential election. Some analysts have said a free-floating yuan could boost US exports and thereby help reduce Washington's massive current account deficit, which IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato has characterized as a threat to the world economy. Rato had said earlier that China should take advantage of a growth rate expected to hit nine percent this year to allow greater flexibility in its exchange rate mechanism. The issue will remain in the spotlight Friday, when finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven dine with their Chinese counterparts. It marks the first time a Chinese delegation will meet with representatives of all of the G7 countries (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States) at once.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Nigerian troops were Friday combing villages and creeks for illegal arms in the troubled Niger Delta, where rebels have threatened the oil industry, a military spokesman said. "We have intensified cordon and search operations in the swamps, villages and creeks. Our efforts have paid off," naval Lieutenant Commander Yakubu Agwom told AFP by telephone from his base in Buguma, west of Port Harcourt, the hub of Nigeria's vast oil resources. Buguma is the home town of rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari, who is fighting for a share of Nigeria's oil wealth and who arrived in the capital Abuja Wednesday for peace talks with government officials. Agwon said security men raided a village near Buguma early this week and found some weapons. "A cache of arms and ammunitions such as AK-47 rifles were found in the village. Although the villagers claimed the weapons were for self-defence against attack by armed gangs terrorising them, they cooperated with security agents by surrendering them," he said. He said ethnic militia and cult gangs such as Dey Gbam, Greenlanders, Egbesu Boys, Bush Boys, Icelanders, Elegamface and Okrika Boys were stockpiling arms to fight for supremacy in the region. The armed struggle is financed by illegal bunkering -- stealing of crude oil from tapped pipelines before selling it to unscrupulous local and foreign buyers. Officials say Nigeria loses some 50,000 barrels of oil daily to smugglers and sea pirates operating in the hundreds of creeks and swamps dotting the Niger delta. Some 500 people have died in gang violence in the past month in Port Harcourt and its surrounding creeks, according to Amnesty International, but the government said only 13 were killed. Rivers State governor Peter Odili is expected to adress a mass rally Friday during which he would attempt to douse the tensions arising from the fighting, his spokesman, Emmanuel Okah, said. The rally has organised to mark Nigeria's 44th independence anniversary. Asari's Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), which late Monday threatened oil installations and asked foreign oil workers to quit the region, is one of the militias fighting for supremacy over control of the west African country's illegal oil trafficking in the area. The group claims to be fighting for the rights of the ethnic Ijaws living around the centre of Nigeria's oil industry, which turns out about 2.3 million barrels per day. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, derives more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange revenue from oil extracted from the Delta region. The unrest in Nigeria has sent jitters to the international oil market where a barrel is hovering around 50 dollars. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned Friday that his government would not tolerate any act of "undue militancy" in the Niger Delta. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," he said in a broadcast to mark the anniversary of independence from Britain. "Government will not tolerate in any way or form any act that would mortgage or compromise the interest of the majority." On Friday, the presence of troops was very visible in Port Harcourt but there was little or no celebration for the independence anniversary.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[DAKAR, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Equatorial Guinea President Teodoro Obiang Nguema has said that a recent foiled plot to oust him from the presidency of the oil-rich central African nation was driven by economic interest groups, Senegalese media reported Friday. "Economic interest groups were behind the coup plot in March; these days Equatorial Guinea is an important country in the oil sector," Obiang was quoted in the Senegalese press as saying. Speaking to reporters in Senegal, where he was wrapping up a state visit with his counterpart Abdoulaye Wade, Obiang declined to specify just which groups he thought were behind the plot, in which South Africans, Armenians and the son of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher have been accused of involvement. Trials opened in Malabo in August for one group of alleged coup-plotters, among them a former Equato-Guinean deputy minister. They are expected to resume Monday. "We have experienced a coup bid led by a group of mercenaries. Behind this group, there were no Equato-Guineans," said Obiang, without going into detail. Press reports have implicated an international network of wealthy businessmen in the alleged plot to oust Obiang, in exchange for which they would have got a slice of Equatorial Guinea's oil riches. Exiled Equato-Guinean opposition leader, Severo Moto, was accused by the authorities in Malabo of masterminding the coup bid, an accusation he vehemently denied in an interview with AFP last month. "You should not think of a coup d'etat because this would only help Obiang andang, is infrastructure minister, and the youngest son in the Obiang clan is secretary of state for hydrocarbons. In 2003, Equatorial Guinea produced some 300,000 barrels per day of oil, according to official figures. Experts in Malabo predict that production figures will rise to 500,000 barrels per day this year, making the tiny country, wedged between Cameroon and Gabon on the Gulf of Guinea, sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil producer after Nigeria and Angola. The annual budget has surged from the equivalent of some 15 to 22 million euros in the 1980s to 91 million euros this year, according to the economy ministry. But the country's wealth has done nothing to bridge the staggering income gap between a small circle of elite Equato-Guineans and the bulk of the population, largely excluded from the benefits that should go with the country's oil wealth.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BOMBAY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Australia got a taste of the perils that await them in next week's Test series against India after being made to struggle on a turning wicket in the three-day tour opener here on Friday. The tourists toiled in stifling hot weather to reach 302-7 declared before national champions Mumbai replied with 150-4 by close of the second day's play at the Brabourne stadium. Damien Martyn, who made 71 before retiring with a stomach upset, and stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist (42 not out) were the only batsmen to make an impression. Barring Matthew Hayden's 67 on the rain-curtailed first day, none of the others crossed 30 on a wicket where the ball spun and bounced. There was little joy with the ball either as pace bowler Brett Lee, hoping to make the team for the first Test at Bangalore from Wednesday, failed to take a wicket in 14 overs that cost 36 runs. Glenn McGrath alone showed the virtue of good line and length in unresponsive conditions and was rewarded with two wickets for just eight runs in 13 overs. Test discard Wasim Jaffar made 48 against an Australian attack without three frontline bowlers in Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz and Shane Warne. Amol Mazumdar was unbeaten at stumps on 50, having put on 70 for the fourth wicket with Vinod Kambli, who was dismissed off the last ball of the day for 26. "It takes time to get used to these conditions but we are getting there," said Martyn. "This is not the easiest wicket to bat on." The Australians, who resumed at the overnight score of 159-3, batted till an hour after lunch before Gilchrist declared the innings. Brad Hodge and Simon Katich, hoping to fill the number three spot left vacant by injured captain Ricky Ponting, failed to settle in after making 30 each. Hodge, a late replacement for Ponting, was snapped up at short-leg off Ramesh Powar. Another Test prospect Michael Clarke ran himself out after making 10 and Shane Watson was trapped leg-before by left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni without scoring. Lee helped Gilchrist add 54 for the seventh wicket before his dismissal, caught in the leg trap off Powar for 21, signalled the declaration.]]></c>

"We urge the public to calmly view our relations with Singapore from a rational perspective," Taiwan's foreign ministry said in a statement. The ministry said it was hopeful that cooperation and exchanges between Taiwan and Singapore would continue despite the recent spat. Scores of people in the southern city of Kaohsiung burnt Singapore's flag in a park to show their support for Chen after his comment sparked an outcry here and in Singapore. "Even a country the size of a booger brazenly criticized Taiwan and former president Lee Teng-hui in the United Nations," Chen said on Monday in response to Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo's speech at the UN General Assembly. He also said Yeo's remark, which warned that an independence drive in Taiwan would lead to war with China, was "nothing but an effort to embrace China's "balls." Taiwanese legislators criticised the remarks, as did Singapore. "Resort to intemperate language cannot assuage these concerns. Many other countries also believe that Taiwan is pursuing a dangerous course towards independence," a Singaporean statement said. Beijing sees Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification -- by force if necessary. The two sides split at the end of a civil war in 1949.]]></c>

It will fund 80 percent and the Dutch 20 percent of the one million-euro project. Vitorino stressed that the centres would not treat asylum demands for EU countries but that the refugees could ask asylum only in the country where such a centre is. "The asylum system will remain the national system for each state (in the pilot scheme)," Vitorino told a press conference after an informal meeting of EU ministers of justice and home affairs. The UNHCR is already running similar projects in several African and central European countries. One of the conditions is that African countries participating have to sign the Geneva convention regulating the treatment of refugees.

		<c><![CDATA[A Lebanese minister who resigned in a dispute over Syria's domination of the country was wounded Friday when his car was targeted by a bomb in what was described as an attack on Lebanon's peace and stability. Outgoing Economy and Trade Minister Marwan Hamadeh's bodyguard was killed and his driver wounded in the blast, which occurred at 9:05 am (0605 GMT) near his home on the Mediterranean seafront of the Lebanese capital. Hamadeh, an aide to Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who has been one of the most vocal opponents of continued Syrian political and security interference in Lebanon, "suffered light shrapnel wounds to the face, the right eyelid and the hands," said a doctor at the American University Hospital. "His life is not in danger. He is undergoing plastic surgery," the source told an AFP correspondent who saw Hamadeh being whisked out of an operating room on a stretcher, with a blood-stained bandage on his head. Army and security forces sealed off the area of the explosion which caused panic in the neighbourhood that includes the American University of Beirut and American Community School. "No group has claimed the blast and nobody has been yet arrested over the blast which caused by the explosion 10 kilos (22 pounds) of explosive material planted in a vehicle next to the minister's car," a police officer told AFP. "The minister was wounded. His bodyguard, internal security forces officer Ghazi Abou Karoum, was killed and his driver was wounded and also taken to hospital for treatment," he said. Lebanese and Syrian officials, as well as foreign diplomats flocked to the hospital crowded with dozens of Hamadeh followers who smashed a glass door when security officers tried to prevent them from entering the building. Jumblatt, standing guard at the hospital entrance to receive well-wishers, asked the crowd to calm down and refused to make any accusations before the end of the investigation. But the secretary general of Jumblatt's party told reporters that "the opposition has clearly received the message." Lebanese President Emile Lahoud ordered "police and judicial authorities to uncover the (truth) behind this act. which aimed at creating national discord," a statement said. Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, who has close ties with Hamadeh, said "this is a blatant attack against civil peace and stability in Lebanon" and ordered "security officials. to promptly uncover those behind this odious crime that targets all honorable men". British Ambassador James Watts, one of a number of people to visit Hamadeh in hospital, said "this is a very serious incident. "Marwan Hamadeh is a very distinguished man and a Lebanese patriot. An attack on him is an attack on co-existence and on the existence of a democratic Lebanon," he told AFP. Anger 2 which backed Lebanon's sovereignty and implicitly censured Damascus by demanding that all foreign troops be withdrawn from the country. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to report to the Security Council Friday on any steps taken by Damascus to implement Resolution 1559.

		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[At least 90 people were killed and 180 wounded as thousands of US and Iraqi forces thrust into the restive Iraqi town of Samarra where the US military said on Friday its troops had seized back the city hall and police stations. A US soldier died in fighting as insurgents refused to surrender after hours of battle. The attack was aimed at reclaiming one of the insurgent-held areas in the Sunni Muslim triangle ahead of nationwide parliamentary elections planned for January. But Samarra inhabitants and some Iraqi officials described the offensive as needless, arguing talks were close to finding a peaceful resolution to an ongoing crisis in the city. The US military said the offensive was in response to what it called "repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces" (US military terminology for insurgents) in the city, where US troops have been largely absent since June. About 2,500 US soldiers from five 1st Infantry Division battalions and 1,000 Iraqi army and national guardsman stormed the city before dawn on Friday. Tanks rumbled in the streets and AC-130 gunships roared overhead. Clashes flared between gunmen and soldiers midnight, US troops moved into the heart of the city and fighting raged. Rebels fired off mortar rounds and rocket-propelled grenades, while US troops pounded their positions. The governor of Salahuddin province, where Samarra is located, warned on Thursday that new fighting risked plunging surrounding towns into violence. "I have. warned the Americans if there is any violence in Balad and Duluiya it is because of what is happening in Samarra," said Governor Hamed Hamud al-Qaissy, referring to nearby towns. Qaissy had said Thursday that local Iraqi officials were close to brokering an Americans return to Samarra, while the leader of a Samarra political association was also stunned by the offensive. "We were in talks with Prime Minister Iyad Allawi about the situation in Samarra including reaching an agreement to allow Iraqi forces to enter the city. We were surprised by this military offensive," said Khaled Naji al-Samarrai. The Americans moved in with the backing of the Iraqi interim government, whose deputy prime minister Barham Saleh announced Thursday the intention to seize back rebel enclaves before November. Peaceful efforts to end the standoff between insurgents and US forces in Samarra unraveled on September 23 when US troops sealed off the city, following an ambush on their soldiers.]]></c>

A total of 3,255 buyers -- almost 15 percent more than in 2003 -- next Monday are expected to arrive in the ritzy French Riviera resort of Cannes for the five-day MIPCOM 2004, the shopwindow for the television, video, cable and satellite industry around the world. They will be spoiled for choice with an array of programmes vying to catch the buyers' fancy, from costume dramas to television mini-series, children's animated cartoons and the still hugely popular reality shows that refuse to go away. With the advertising industry finally pulling itself out of the doldrums and new revenue sources coming on line through mobile telephones and DVD sales, the show's organisers Reed MIDEM are upbeat that the tide is turning for the television sector. "For the last five years the market has been in the doldrums," Paul Johnson, director of Reed MIDEM's television division, told AFP. But the strong rise in the number of participants at an earlier trade show, MipTV, indicated "we are tracking well for MIPCOM", he said. A total 1,326 exhibiting companies from over 57 countries has signed on, up 12.8 percent and seven percent, respectively, from figures a year ago. Countries offering programmes for sale for the first time will be Indonesia, Iran, Ivory Coast, Lithuania, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela. Interest in Asia continues to ride high, particularly in the potentially enormous Chinese market. Johnson said he expected Asian participation in MIPCOM to be more than 10 percent higher this year compared with 2003, whilst the number of Asian/Pacific buyers due in town was expected to climb more than 16 percent. Most of the world's heavyweight TV and film studios will be present, including Warner Bros., Paramount Studios and 20th Century Fox. But the industry's Lilliputians, which often lack the financial clout to pay for stands, will also be out in force this year. Almost 1,700 companies are expected to pitch up in surrounding hotel rooms and do business in cafes and restaurants -- 36 percent more than in 2003. Television also will share the spotlight with the latest darling of the entertainment industry: the booming mobile telephone market. Mobile ringtones and games are already big money-earners and leading executives from the sector will use MIPCOM to brainstorm to see how they can cash in on the enhanced viewing opportunities offered by the new third-generation videophones. While mobile telephones are not expected to overtake television as the main broadcast media, they are proving to be a popular way of viewing small snippets of content. Italian mobile opkthrough at MIPCOM 2004, but there is some nifty guesswork. A new children's animated television series called "Trollz", based on the long-haired troll dolls that were all the rage in the 1960s, is attracting a lot of attention. The re-looked colourful teen troll characters could become all the rage, just in time for Christmas.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The secretary general of the 45-member pan-European rights watchdog Council of Europe on Thursday welcomed the prospect of former Communist Poland taking over the chairmanship of the body for the first time. "I am very much looking forward to the chairmanship of Poland," Terry Davies told reporters after meeting Foreign Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz. "Poland has an important geographic, historical and political position. It is going to take a very active role as a bridge between western and eastern Europe," he added. In mid-November new EU member Poland is taking over the six-month presidency of the organization for the first time in its history. Warsaw on May 16-17 will host a summit of heads of state of the Council of Europe, the third to be organised by the Strasbourg-based body. The first took place in Vienna in 1993, following the fall of Communism and the establishment of new democracies in central and eastern Europe. The second summit, held in Strasbourg in 1997, gave a new impetus to human rights protection, including the decision to set up a Human Rights Commissioner for Europe.]]></c>

The film, which picked up the jury grand prize Silver Lion award at the Venice film festival last month, tells the story of a paralysed man who wants to commit suicide. While pulling no punches in telling the story of Ramon Sampedro, "Mar Adentro" manages the trick of being an uplifting film about illness and death as it recounts Sampedro's losing battle in the Spanish court system for the legal right to assisted suicide and the taking of his own life.

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Turkey has made significant reforms to position itself for one day joining the European Union, but in many key areas they still fall short, an EU report due to be published next week says, according to France's Le Monde newspaper. The abolition of the death penalty, a crackdown on the use of torture, a reduction in the role the powerful military has to play in society and increased tolerance for the Kurdish population all show "a substantial institutional convergence towards European standards," Saturday's edition of Le Monde quoted the report as saying. Nevertheless, its publication next Wednesday will also highlight shortcomings. "Even though torture is no longer systematic, several cases of torture and particularly ill-treatment continue to occur and extra efforts will be needed to eradicate such practices," the report said. Complaints of torture outside of official detention centres "considerably" increased in the first half of 2003, it said. Army chiefs who in the past stepped in to shape the direction of Turkey "continue to exert influence through a series of informal channels", new laws are often interpreted in a "restrictive" fashion, religious minorities are not accorded the same rights as citizens from the Muslim majority, and human rights activists "remain subject to judicial harrassment", it said. Turkey has been seeking EU membership since 1963 but the bid has been controversial, with many existing EU member states questioning whether the largely Muslim nation of some 70 million could fit easily into the bloc.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The European Medicines Agency is to review all drugs in the same class as Vioxx after US pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew the arthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said Friday. Merck announced a global withdrawal Thursday of Vioxx, a blockbuster arthritis drug, after a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks. "We are going to see whether there is a class effect," a spokesman for the London-based agency said. The US Food and Drug Administration also has said it would study the effects of other drugs in the same class as the withdrawn drug. Vioxx, which is scientifically known as rofecoxib, has been marketed in more than 80 countries and produced sales of 2.5 billion dollars in 2003. The European Medicines Agency carried out a review of the drug class which includes Vioxx -- known as COX-2 inhibitors -- at the request of French authorities, but concluded in November 2003 that the products did not need to be withdrawn from the market.]]></c>

"We think we'll achieve more than the 770,000 cars sold last year," chairman Martin Winterkorn told the online newspaper Netzeitung. Sales would rise "by between one and three percent," he predicted. Audi had not previously given any concrete sales forecast for 2004, saying only that it was expecting to achieve record sales. Audi, which comprises the Audi and Lamborghini brands, is performing much better than its parent VW.

Salauskas said, after meeting with Berger, that Rynair intended to begin service to Lithuania from September 2005 and planned to carry 200,000 passengers a year.

		<c><![CDATA[Israel's one million strong Arab community went on a general strike Friday in memory of 13 Arab Israeli Arab youths shot dead by Israeli police at the start of the intifada four years ago. The 13 were killed during protests in support of the uprising in October 2000, several days after the outbreak of the intifada. "This general strike was called to commemorate the memory of our 13 martyrs who fell at the hands of the Israeli police," Shawki al-Khatib, head of the Higher Monitoring Committee for Arab Affairs in Israel, told AFP. Aside from the strike, a large demonstration was expected to take place in the village of Sakhnin in the Galilee region. In Nazareth, the biggest Arab town in Israel, a memorial was dedicated to the 13 on Friday, Nazareth mayor Ramez Jaraisseh told AFP. Israeli by nationality but Palestinian in spirit, Arab Israelis are frequently subjected to discrimination in a country where they make up almost one fifth of the overall population, which numbers 6.78 million. They are the Palestinians who remained on their land following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Every year, they observe a general strike on March 30, known as Land Day, in memory of a day in 1976 when six Arab Israelis were shot dead by the army during demonstrations against the confiscation of hundreds of hectares of their land.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The European Commission and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will set up p and central European countries. One of the conditions is that African countries participating have to sign the Geneva convention regulating the treatment of refugees. This condition will mean that Libya will have to sign the Geneva convention. The pilot schemes are not to be confused with the idea put forward by German home affairs minister Otto Schily to set up an EU body outside Europe TO receive and examine asylum applications, Vitorino stressed. Even if none of the ministers has vetoed the idea of examining asylum demands outside the EU, they appear to be deeply divided over the practicalities of such a plan. "The question of whether asylum demands can possibly be handled outside the EU will be looked at very carefully," said Dutch Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk, who presided over the informal discussion. Vitorino said the commission kept an open mind regarding such talks but named a number of fundamental conditions. The commission wants firm cooperation with third countries, clarity on how judicial review will be handled if asylum demands are decided upon outside the EU, plans for the resettlement of failed asylum seekers and working towards a common EU asylum system. But these are all long-term projects and Vitorino also spoke of the humanitarian crisis currently taking place in the Mediterranean where hundreds of illegal immigrants try to reach the European mainland by boats. "There is agreement that we should be proactive in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean. to prevent (it) from turning into a graveyard," he said. Illegal immigrants intercepted in EU territorial waters are to dealt with within the EU countries but those caught in international waters are to be sent back to north Africa and held in humanitarian centres there.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Attack on minister targeted Lebanon's democracy: Lebanese, foreign officials.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BEIRUT, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Lebanese officials and foreign diplomats denounced as a grave attack on Lebanon's democracy Friday the bomb that targeted a minister who recently resigned over Syria's domination of the country. Outgoing Economy and Trade Minister Marwan Hamadeh, a close aide to prominent Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who has been one of the most vocal critics of Syria's political and security interferences, was lightly injured. Hamadeh's bodyguard was killed and his driver slightly injured in the morning attack outside the house of the 65-year-old minister on the capital's Mediterranean seafront. Although Jumblatt preferred to await results of the investigation into the incident, a statement by his party, the leftist mainly Druze Progressive Socialist Party, blamed the "state police" for the attack. "The police state. has proven its efficiency in targeting one of the symbols of the nation, the Democratic Gathering and the Progressive Socialist Party," it said in a statement. The party said the attack fell within "the aggressive campaign targeting PSP President Walid Jumblatt and which recently started with random arrests. to deter him from pursuing the struggle for a state of law and democracy." It vowed that "the civil war sought by some parties will not come via the PSP, which is conscious of such cheap attempts." In a statement, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud ordered "police and judicial authorities to uncover the (truth) behind this act. which aimed at planting national discord." Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, who maintains close relations with Hamadeh, said "this is a blatant attack against civil peace and stability in Lebanon." British Ambassador James Watts, one of a number of people to visit Hamadeh at the American University Hospital, said "this is a very serious incident. "Marwan Hamadeh is a very distinguished man and a Lebanese patriot. An attack on him is an attack on co-existence and on the existence of a democratic Lebanon," he told AFP. In Paris, the French foreign ministry condemned the attack, with spokesman Herve Ladsous saying: "This act committed against a Lebanese politician strikes a blow at Lebanese democracy." Amid angry shouts from the crowd of Hamadeh followers at the entrance of the hospital, Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam declared that "the Syrian leadership, headed by President Bashar al-Assad, was in great shock went it learned of the attempt on the life against brother and friend Marwan Hamadeh." "Hamadeh is one of the political personalities that exerted big efforts for the national accord in Lebanon and for the consolidation and coordination of Lebanese-Syrian relations," Khaddam told reporters. "We were very happy to hear that our brother Marwan is in g that all foreign troops be withdrawn from the country. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to report to the Security Council Friday on any steps taken by Damascus to implement Resolution 1559.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NAIROBI, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The body of a Kenyan girl, who allegedly died after she was raped by a British soldier, will be exhumed at the weekend for forensic analysis, the British High Commission said on Friday, insisting that justice would be pursued till the end. On September 20, a Kenyan court ordered the body of 16-year-old Mantoi Lekoloi Kaunda to be exhumed, six years after she was buried, for analysis to find out if she died as a result of an alleged rape by a British soldier in 1998. The remains of Lekoloi, who was buried at her home in Archer's Post in eastern Kenya, one of the ranges where British soldiers carried out exercises, are due to be exhumed on Saturday, an official in the high commission told AFP. "The UK ministry of defence takes these allegations extremely seriously and is determined to get to the truth. This is an unparalleled investigation, in terms of size and scope, and is being conducted with permission and full assistance of authorities in Kenya," the commission said in a statement sent to AFP. "This is absolutely vital to ensure that justice is done," it said, adding that it was too early to predict the time-frame of the probe or predict its outcome. "The investigation is complicated by the length of time since some of the alleged incidents took place, the remoteness of the areas involved, and the volume of information that has been gathered," the statement explained. Lekoloi's case was highlighted as investigators drawn from Britain's Royal Military Police Special Investigations Branch and Kenya police are probing alleged rapes over the course of 30 years of hundreds of Maasai and Samburu women whose cases have been taken up by a British lawyer. The court ordered the exhumation on the basis that the remains of Lekoloi, who was allegedly raped when she was six months pregnant, would be reburied immediately after the analysis.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Business software maker PeopleSoft said Friday it was dumping president and chief executive Craig Conway, who has led the fight against a hostile takeover effort from rival Oracle. The Silicon Valley group said its board voted to appoint Dave Duffield, the company founder and chairman, as CEO, and announced the appointment of two co-presidents. "These appointments followed the board's decision to terminate Craig Conway as president and CEO of the company, effective immediately," the statement said. "The board said its decision resulted from a loss of confidence in Mr. Conway's ability to continue to lead the company. All of these decisions received the unanimous vote of the independent directors. The board would like to thank Mr. Conway for his contributions to PeopleSoft." The board appointed Kevin Parker and Phil Wilmington as co-presidents. It also named Aneel Bhusri vice chairman. It was not immediately clear what impact the moves would have on the Oracle hostile takeover bid, one of the most bitter corporate fights to hit the US high-tech industry. While PeopleSoft has managed so far to fend off the bid from Oracle, that effort suffered a setback earlier this month when a judge ruled that the government cannot block the proposed 7.7-billion-dollar merger on antitrust grounds. Analyst Art Hogan of Jefferies and Co. said it wass too early to say for sure that the ouster of Conway clears the way for a merger with Oracle, but Wall Street appears to be seeing it that way. PeopleSoft's shares rose nearly eight percent in pre-market trading. "The obvious interpretation is that this makes the deal more doable," Hogan said. Hogan expected to see strength in the software sector on anticipation of more merger activity. "If this deal happens, its starts the daisy chain of a whole lot more merger and acquisition activity," he said. Hugh Johnson of First Albany said he's unsure if the Conway ouster clears the way for the Oracle bid, but he added "that certainly would be my knee-jerk reaction." PeopleSoft provided few clues as to its course of action in the face of the Oracle bid: "Commenting on Oracle's tender offer, (independent director) Skip Battle noted that all decisions with respect to Oracle's tender offer have been made on the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction Committee of the Board."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Spain's government adopts bill legalising gay marriages (UPDATES, CHANGES date).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MADRID, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. It will also give gay couples the right to adopt. The plan "recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner," cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters. "But also when it comes to asking to adopt a child." The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans. "It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life," insisted Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference. But according to an opinion poll conducted in late July, some two-thirds of Spaniards are in favour of gay marriages and now the cabinet has approved the bill such liaisons could become legal from as early as next year. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element of his social policy despite outrage from the Church. Spain "is in the forefront of Europe and of the world in the struggle against centuries of discrimination," de la Vega said. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual. Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt. Such unions are also legal in six Canadian provinces and the northeastern US state of Massachusetts. De la Vega said: "There are thousands of children already living in Spain with homosexual parents and more than 50 studies show there are no differences between children who grow up with homosexual parents and others." "Most Spanish people think what is important in adoption is the well-being of the child quite apart from the sexual orientation of the parents," she said. Some 14 articles of the civil code will be altered so that the words "man and woman" and "father and mother" are replaced by "partners" or "parents". According to Justice Minister Juan Fernando Lopez de Aguilar, "this initiative has not been taken against anything or anyone" and he told the news conference that the government "is cooperating with the (Roman Catholic) Church and considers that an open conflict with it is not good." "This law is part of the Socialist programme which has been voted for by the Spanish,"said Beatriz Gimeno, president of the country's Gay, Lesbian and Transexuals Federation. "The Church has nothing to say about it. This interventionist tendency by the Church is the virus and must be eradicated,". The message focused particularly on countries supporting the US-led coalition in Iraq and pointed out that their interests were everywhere. "We must start the resistance from now. against the Crusader campaign. like resistance in Iraq, Afghanistan, in Palestine and in Chechnya," he said, taking aim in particular at the United States, Britain and France. "Young Muslims, here is our message. if we are killed or taken prisoner, continue the path (of resistance) after us. Don't betray God and his Prophet," said the voice attributed to be Zawahiri's. "It's the era of Muslim resistance, after the (Arab) governments submitted to the Zionist occupant. We should learn the lesson of Chechnya, Afghanistan, of Iraq, of Palestine. "Don't wait for the American, British, French, South Korean, Hungarian and Polish forces to enter Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen and Algeria to start the resistance," the speaker added. "We should start the resistance from now. The interests of the Americans, English, Australian, French, Polish, Norwegian, South Korean and Japanese are everywhere," he said. "All (these countries) participated in the occupation of Afghanistan or Iraq or Chechnya, or help Israel to survive," added the voice. Zawahiri, the righthand man of Osama bin Laden, was last heard in a videotape broadcast by the Qatar-based news channel on September 9 in which he forecast a US defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US intelligence agency, the CIA, said then it believed that tape to be authentic and could have been recently recorded.]]></c>

An intelligence official said 19 people were killed and more than 30 injured in the attack. "We believe the bomber carried the explosive into the mosque in a briefcase which he detonated while sitting amongst the worshippers and also blew himself up," the official, who would not be identified, told AFP. "It is an act of terrorism which has claimed 16 lives and injured around 40 people," city police chief Nisar Ahmed earlier told AFP. "We believe a suicide bomber carried out the dastardly attack at a time when hundreds of worshippers were present inside the mosque for Friday's prayers," Ahmed said. Ahmed said several hundred angry protesters poured onto the streets outside the mosque after the blast and clashed with police. Witnesses said body parts and blood were spattered across the interior of the mosque, and that the explosion left a large crater and caused extensive damage to the mosque building. "We were hearing the Khutba (sermon) when suddenly there was a big bang," said worshipper Hamid Naqvi. "There was panic and there was blood and screams all around," he said. Naqvi, who was hit by shrapnel, was speaking from the city's Allama Iqbal hospital where doctors said at least 34 wounded people had been taken. "Some of the bodies have serious burn wounds," Dr Mohammad Ali told AFP. Television channels showed gory scenes inside the mosque with pieces of human flesh and limbs lying around in pools of blood. People were shown crying and beating their chests. Angry people clashed with police and burnt several police vehicles. Private television channels reported that the army has been called in to quell the unrest after the blast. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz both condemned the attack. The incident "clearly shows that terrorists have no religion and are enemies of mankind", a state-run Associated Press of Pakistan report quoted Musharraf as saying in a statement. Aziz said killing people at a place of worship was a "highly condemnable" act. "Islam is a religion of peace and abhors terrorism." The attack came five days after Pakistani security forces killed the country's most wanted Sunni Muslim extremist, Al-Qaeda operative Amjad Farooqi, in a shootout in the south of the country. Farooqi, the alleged mastermind of several attempts to kill Prehich left 45 people dead. The latest bombing also comes as the Pakistani security forces are locked in a fierce battle against Al-Qaeda which has seen a number of important arrests since July. The most notable were Pakistani computer expert Naeem Noor Khan and Tanzanian Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, who has been indicted by a US court for his role in the twin bombing of American embassies in East Africa in 1998. Musharraf, who threw his support behind the US "war on terror" after the September 11 attacks, said this month he was making significant inroads into breaking the Al-Qaeda network and that more than 600 Al-Qaeda suspects had been detained.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[India said Friday it had asked the United States to withdraw sanctions it had imposed against two the United States or doing business with any US-based companies. Sarna said one of the Indian scientists has never been to Iran and the other one had not visited the country since mid-2003. "It has been conveyed that we don't share the US views," he added. Despite the sanctions against the scientists, India and United States have deepened technology cooperation over the past few months. Last month, Washington announced it had agreed to lift export controls on equipment for nuclear facilities in India after New Delhi assured the United States it would address US non-proliferation concerns.

		<c><![CDATA[Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath reacted angrily Friday to calls from US Secretary of State Colin Powell for an end to the four-year-old intifada, or uprising. "The secretary of state would have done better to to call on Israel to stop its aggression against the Palestinian people," Shaath told Egypt's Voice of the Arabs radio. His comments came as at least 45 Palestinians and five Israelis were killed in a three-day Israeli incursion into the northern Gaza Strip. Shaath said he remained pessimistic about any progress towards a negotiated settlement, at least until after US presidential elections next month. Powell said in an interview aired Thursday that the intifada had done nothing for the Palestinians and urged them to end it. "What is the intifada in its five years of existence. What has it accomplished to the Palestinian people. Has it produced progress toward a Palestinian state. Has it defeated Israel on the battlefield." Powell asked in an interview with the Al-Jazeera satellite news channel. "So it is time to end this process. It is time to end the intifada," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Supporters of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic gave a hostile welcome Friday to chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte as she visited Belgrade to attend a conference, witnesses said. Riot police were on hand as a group of around 30 protesters gathered outside a Belgrade hotel where Del Ponte attended the start of a conference on war crimes, amid mounting pressure on Belgrade to hand over fugitive indictees. The protesters waved banners in support of Milosevic, who is on trial at the UN war crimes court at The Hague for his role in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. It is the prosecutor's first visit to Belgrade since October, when she delivered indictments against four Serbian generals charged with war crimes allegedly committed during the 1998-99 Kosovo conflict. She is due to meet Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica during a return visit on Monday, when she is expected to demand the arrest of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic and the four generals. Her trip comes a day after US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman and the US senior envoy for war crimes, Pierre-Richard Prosper, visited Belgrade to step up pressure on Serbia to arrest war crimes suspects. But despite the withholding of badly needed US aid and threats of sanctions, Kostunica has said the stability of the Balkan country is more important than arresting war crimes suspects. He has also maintained that local courts should be able to prosecute war crimes cases which have yet to be heard at The Hague. Del Ponte said cases could be transferred as early as next year but Serbian courts had to prove they were ready to handle them. "Local prosecutors and judges have to be focused more and more on building capacity for domestic war crimes persecutions," she said, adding such cases would be "a very serious test" for domestic courts and institutions. Grossman told reporters after meeting Serbian leaders that "the deadline was yesterday" for arresting Mladic, and warned Serbia it faced international isolation if it continued to obstruct the UN tribunal at The Hague. Mladic and Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic were charged in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Bosnia's 1992-95 war. A Belgrade court issued warrants for the arrest of the four generals earlier this week but they remain comfortably at large. One of the four, police general Sreten Lukic, responded Thursday to a court summons and formally received the indictment, but he was not arrested, a court spokeswoman told AFP. Spokeswoman Sonja Prostran said the former deputy interior minister was "informed about the charges and a demand on his transfer (to The Hague)." Lukic was the chief of Serbian police forces in Kosovo under the overall command of then-Yugoslav president Milosevic. The other three generals have failed to appear in court.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LAHORE, Pakistan, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Record-pursuing penalty corner striker Sohail Abbas scored two goals as Pakistan held rival India 4-4 in the fourth match of the eight-match hockey series in the Pakistani city of Lahore Friday. The 28-year-old striker has now to score three more goals to break the record of Dutchman Paul Litjens who holds the world record of 267 goals in 177 matches. Pakistan's Rehan Butt broke even with India just three minutes before the close of play as the guests held sway in most of the second half in a match watched by a crowd of around 25,000. Pakistan's other goal came from Akhtar Ali while India scored through Vikram Pillay, Sandeep Singh, Arjun Halappa and Ignace Tirkey in a match that exhibited some slick moves and goals. The series, the first between the arch rivals since 1999, is led by Pakistan by two matches to one with the next leg of four matches scheduled to be held in India between October 4-10. Pakistan won the first match in the southern port city of Karachi by 2-1 but India staged a comeback to take the second match by 4-1 at Quetta. Pakistan won the third match at Peshawar by 3-2. Pakistan opened through their first penalty corner when Abbas's rasping push hit the net in the 14th minute. India, who missed their first penalty corner, came level when man of the match Halappa's try was rebounded to Pillay who secured India's equaliser in the 16th minute. Both teams were locked at 1-1 at half time. Right winger Halappa exposed the weak Pakistani defense with swift moves and earned India their third penalty corner in the 40th minute on which Sandeep Singh scored to give India a 2-1 lead. Just three minutes later, Abbas fired his 265th goal in his 215th match to again bring the home team level. Halappa once again caught the Pakistan defense napping and from the top of the circle put his team into the lead in the 50th minute and then gave a golden back pass to Ignace Tirkey who scored India's fourth goal in the 52nd minute. Egged on by a vocal crowd, Pakistan unleashed an assault on the Indian goal and Ali scored the third off Pakistan's third penalty corner in the 58th minute and with three minutes to play Butt put home the fourth off a rebound from the fourth penalty corner. The Indian leg will comprise matches in New Delhi (October 4), Chandigarh (October 6), Amritsar (October 8) and Hyderabad (October 10). India agreed to revive the bilateral hockey series last year amid a thaw in relations. The bilateral series held in 1998 and 1999 was put on hold due to tensions between the nuclear rivals over the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Wall Street opened higher as the market kicked off October on a positive note, with the software sector lending support after a shakeup at PeopleSoft. In the first 15 minutes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 52.21 points (0.52 percent) to 10,132.48 and the Nasdaq composite climbed 15.44 points (0.81 percent) to 1,912.28. Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak said Wall Street was buoyed by gains on overseas markets after an upbeat reading of the closely-followed tankan business sentiment survey in Japan. There is also "optimism that now that we are actually going to get third quarter earnings as opposed to just pre-announcements, that maybe it won't be as bad as the pre-announcements implied," said Boockvar. Also helping, said the analyst, was a fresh dip in oil prices and JP Morgan's upgrade of semiconductor equipment makers, Novellus Systems and Teradyne. PeopleSoft was up more than six percent after a shakeup in top management that could clear the way for a takeover by Oracle, and possibly lead to further consolidation.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LISBON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has filed a police complaint against an unidentified man who made threats against him in a magazine interview published in Portugal last month, local media reported Friday. The former coach of Champions League-winning club Porto accused the man of uttering death threats and defamation, daily newspaper Correio da Manha reported. The man also told weekly celebrity magazine "Flash." he needed to settle a score with Mourinho. "I will hunt him down throughout his years in London. I am going to shoot him in the leg. I am going to give him a beating he will never forget. He will spend his life running from me, surrounded by security," the man added. Mourinho, 41, has said he received death threats against him and his family on the eve of Porto's Champions League final against Monaco in Germany in May related to his move to Chelsea. In an updated edition of his autobiography published last month in Portugal, Mourinho said he lived "dramatic weeks of terror" as he feared for his life and the safety of his family. He said in the book that he refused to celebrate Porto's 3-0 win over Monaco because of the threats, preferring instead to stay on the sidelines with his wife and children. Last month a group of Porto fans admitted that a fellow spectator had sent death threats to Mourinho before the final in retaliation against the coach's alleged harassment of a woman fan by telephone and text message. Mourinho has denied the allegations. On Wednesday he was spat at by a visiting Porto fan at Stamford Bridge just before Chelseas 3-1 win over his former club. The fan was ejected from the ground and hosts Chelsea are not expected to face any repercussions but UEFA have opened a disciplinary inquiry against Porto. Mourinho has reportedly faxed a letter to UEFA pleading with them not to punish his old club. The two teams will meet again in Portugal on December 7 on the return leg of the second round of the Champions League.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A second Palestinian gunmen was killed Friday by Israeli troops after he and other militants tried to storm the Erez border crossing between the northern Gaza Strip and Israel, sources on both sides said. The two militants were part of an eight-strong group that was "armed and carrying a 30-kilogramme (66-pound) explosive charge," Israeli military sources said. The others were nabbed by the army. The botched attack was jointly claimed by the Islamist Hamas movement and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a radical group affiliated to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement. The dead were named as Hamas militant Mohammed Salem and Brigades fighter Salem al-Bureina by militants announcing their "martyrdom" through loudspeakers in the Jabaliya refugee camp. Forty-five Palestinians have died since the Israeli tanks rolled into the northern Gaza Strip three days ago to try and stop militant rocket attacks on southern Israel. Five Israelis were also killed, three in Gaza gunbattles and two in a rocket attack on Sderot, just across the Gaza border. An army spokeswoman said two rockets struck in Sderot Friday afternoon, without causing any casualties. The deaths brought the overall toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising four years ago to 5,000, including 3,376 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Moscow Friday stiffened security at two of its international airports following the downing of two passenger jets and the Beslan hostage tragedy that together killed over 400 people, Russian media reports said. According to Sergei Gorbunov, vice president of EastLine -- a company providing security at Moscow's Domodedovo airport -- passengers will now have to remove some clothing items and hand them over for security checks. "Since Friday, the control of shoes has become compulsory for all passengers. These will have to take them off, put them in a plastic box and pass them through X-ray machines," Gorbunov was quoted by RIA Novosti as saying. Passengers will also be asked to take off their coats, jackets and belts, he said, adding that an explosive detecting portal has been installed at Domodedovo, Moscow's most modern airport. "We are currently using one machine, but we are going to buy five more to install at all exits to the tarmac," Gorbunov said. On August 24, two passengers jets had crashed almost simultaneously over southern Russian in what authorities said was an attack by female suicide bombers carrying explosives. All 90 people on board were killed. The attacks were later claimed by Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, as was the Beslan school hostage taking that killed at least 344 people, half of them children, in addition to 31 rebels. A spokeswoman for Moscow's international Sheremetyevo airport, however, told RIA Novosti that while the order by the government's transport service to boost airport security came into force Friday, the security measures had been implemented "a long time ago." According to her, the number of security staff at Sheremetyevo has increased by 30 percent since 2003.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BOLOGNA, Italy, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Italian sports doctor Michele Ferrari, who has worked with several top cyclists including six-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, has been given a 12-month suspended jail sentence for malpractice by a court here, legal sources said on Friday. However Ferrari, the former doctor of several cycling teams - most notably Gewiss in the mid 1990's - was acquitted of distributing doping products which could endanger health. Just 10 days ago, Italian prosecutor Lorenzo Gestri had recommended a 14-month prison sentence for Ferrari for administering performance-enhancing substances to cyclists. On leaving the court, Ferrari, who used to work under notorious Italian sports doctor Francesco Conconi, said: "I certainly did not expect this sentence because I am innocent of this whole affair." Ferrari's lawyer Dario Bolognesi said they would appeal, and emphasised that his client had been acquitted of the most serious charge of distributing doping products. "We will appeal. The most serious accusation has gone and the whole trial is linked to the interpretation of standards in doping and sporting fraud, and to the comments of rider Filippo Simeoni," Bolognesi said. It now remains to be seen how 33-year-old Armstrong will react. The American has in the past staunchly defended his decision to work with Ferrari but said he would cut off all contact with him if he was ever found guilty. Italian rider Simeoni, one of Ferrari's main accusers and currently in Verona for the world road race championships, said the court's judgement had vindicated his decision to speak out. "From a human point of view, I regret Ferrari's sentence but it shows my statements were justified and that there is justice in this world. You just have to be patient," said the Domina Vacanze rider. He continued: "Everyone knew what was going on but no one said anything. But I spoke out and I am happy that my comments finally bore fruit, especially after the attacks from Lance Armstrong and other cyclists." The 33-year-old Simeoni's statements to prosecutors have won him no favours in the professional peloton, and Armstrong especially singled out the Italian at the end of this year's Tour de France. The acrimony came to a head in July's race after Simeoni said he still intended to sue Armstrong for defamation over comments made by him in French newspaper Le Monde in July 2003. The article quoted Armstrong as saying that Simeoni had "lied" when he gave evidence to investigators claiming that Ferrari had showen him how to use the banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin) without getting caught. Armstrong made public in 2001 that he had been working with the notorious Ferrari, who once famously said that taking EPO was as harmful as drinking orange juice. Ferrari was the doctor with the Gewiss team in 1994 when three of the team's riders took all the podium places in the tough Belgian one-day classic. After Ferrari later revealed the secret of his team's success he was sacked, but he continued having contact with several top athletes over the years, including history-making Armstrong.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Suspected Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow Nepal's monarchy Friday tried to assassinate an army officer and shot at a helicopter carrying goods to one of their mountain strongholds, wounding two people, police said. A bomb detonated near the house of Colonel Pradip Vikram Rana at Nayachok on Kathmandu's outskirts as he returned home in his jeep, causing minor wounds to Rana's wife but not injuring the officer, police said. In southwestern Nepal, a helicopter heading to the central town of Rukum was hit by three bullets soon after it took off in Surkhet and was forced to land in the nearby Indian border city of Nepalgunj, a police official said. The lead pilot was not injured, but co-pilot Shashi Giri was shot and was undergoing hospital treatment, the official said. He said the helicopter belonged to the private Karnali company and was transporting essential civilian goods to Rukum, a Maoist-dominated mountain town with no reliable road links to urban centres. The Maoists have fired on helicopters in the past, usually on suspicion they were ferrying troops or weapons, but it was the first time rebels are believed to have inflicted a casualty in such an attack. The guerrillas enjoy free rein in much of the Himalayan kingdom's countryside and have systematically destroyed symbols of the Kathmandu government's rule such as government offices and bridges. More than 10,000 people have died in the civil war since 1996. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba last month asked the Maoists to resume talks that broke down in August 2003, but the rebels responded by questioning whether King Gyanendra and the army supported Deuba's peace initiative. The government in a response Thursday said it had full authority over security forces.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A senior Sunni religious figure vented his outrage on Friday against those behind a double suicide bombing the previous day that left scores of children dead in Baghdad. "Who is responsible for these car bombings, supposedly aimed at the occupation, but which target children, women and elderly Iraqis," asked Sheikh Abdel Ghafur al-Samarrai during Friday prayers at the Umm al-Qura mosque in Baghdad. "May he who wants to kill to express his hatred for somebody and kills dozens of Iraqis claiming to be a martyr go to hell," the cleric, a member of the influential Committee of Muslim Scholars, the main Sunni authority in Iraq. He was preaching a day after a car bombing at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in the Iraqi capital that killed 34 children and eight adults. As the nation mourned the dead, the group of suspected Al-Qaeda operative Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings in Iraq on a website. But Samarrai asked: "Why target the police or any other Iraqis. By what fatwa (religious edict) are such acts justified. "Who would write such fatwas for suicide bombers who claim to be liberating the country." he went on, adding that: "Such acts are against the population and not the occupation." Another member of the committee, Sheikh Ahmed Hassan al-Taha al-Samarrai, denounced a new operation by the US-led military and Iraqi forces against insurgents holed up in the restive city of Samarra, north of Baghdad. During a prayer session at the Abu Hanifa mosque in Baghdad he estimated that the largely Sunni inhabitants of Samarra did nothing "other than deny foreign forces entry to their city." At least 90 people were killed and 180 wounded as thousands of troops thrust into Samarra before dawn Friday, in the first major push to reclaim the country's troublespots in the run-up to the January elections.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[More than 150,000 people left the states that made up former communist East Germany in 2003 to move to the richer western regions, the Federal Statistical Office said Friday. A total of 155,400 people -- more than half of them aged 18-30 -- moved to the west, however the figures were down from 176,700 the previous year, it said in a statement. Germany celebrates 14 years of reunification Sunday, but unemployment in the former communist part of Germany is double that in the west and residents, many of them young, have been abandoning the region in droves in search of work.

		<t><![CDATA[Birdie blitz catapults Els into lead by Erskine McCullough =.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[KILKENNY, Ireland, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A birdie blitz catapulted Ernie Els to the top of the leaderboard at the WGC American Express championship here on Friday. The South African, who had warned before the tournament that he was raring to go after a two week lay-off, opened his second round with four straight birdies to move to seven-under and one ahead of first round leader Todd Hamilton who had just teed off. Els reached the turn in 31 when he birdied the ninth but the gap with Hamilton remained at one as the American birdied his second hole. But then Els moved to nine-under with a birdie at the 10th and the gap widened to two. But with still eight holes to play, Els still had plenty of work left to do to keep his place atop the leaderboard. Unlike on Thursday when conditions were ideal, the players were having to compete with driving rain squalls which were interupted from time to time with a brief glimpse of the sun. The early morning starters saw none of the sun as rain poured down but despite the conditions Fred Couple shot a brilliant five-under 67 to move to four-under for the tournament. Sergio Garcia, who began the day only one back of the lead, got the worst possible start when he dropped his drive on the par three third into the pond guarding the green. The Spaniard ran up a double bogey and was suddenly five behind the charging Els. Tiger Woods, still clearly suffering from the shoulder injury that dogged him on Thursday, continued to fight through the pain. Two birdies after only seven holes took him to six-under and firmly in touch as he chases his third straight win in the championship. Ireland's Padraig Harrington was giving the local fans brave enough to battle the elements something to smile about as he was two-under for his round after 12 holes. It put the world number eight at five-under. Angel Cabrera was on one of his famed hot streaks as he carded three birdies after only eight holes to go to six-under. With the green softened by the rain, birdies were there to be had but American Chad Campbell, who started his second round at two-under par, found himself racing back down the leaderboard as he collected two double bogeys in his opening three holes. Another at the ninth and suddenly Campbell reached the turn seven-over for his round and four-over for the championship. Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee, struggling in the rain, went out in five-over 41 but a hole-in-one at the 169-yard 11th gave him something to finally smile about. It was his second hole-in-one in Europe this year. Earlier he had holed in one at the PGA Championship at Wentworth.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Three men were charged Friday under Britain's main anti-terrorist law, police said, in the wake of a sting operation involving a gang that was allegedly looking to buy material for a radioactive "dirty bomb". In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said the three men -- Roque Flaviano Fernandes, 43, Dominic Agnelo Martins, 44, and Abdurahman Ranyare -- would appear in a London court on Saturday. "All are charged under section 17 of the Terrorism Act 2000 that they entered into, or became concerned in, an arrangement as a result of which money or other property was made available, or was to be made available to another, and knew or had reasonable cause to suspect, that it will or may be used for the purposes of terrorism," the police said. The three were arrested last Friday, two days before the News of the World newspaper reported that it had infiltrated a gang that was looking to buy a kilogram of "red mercury" -- a Soviet-era material which it said could be used to make a handheld radioactive bomb. Its reporter was told that the material was being sought by an unidentified Saudi, "for use here in the United Kingdom or in the United States", who was ready to pay 300,000 pounds (441,500 euros, 541,000 dollars) for it. A fourth man was also arrested, but released Thursday without charge. Peter Clarke, the senior detective who heads the Metropolitan Police anti-terrorist branch, said in Friday's statement that the charges were laid after consultation with prosecutors. "We are grateful to the News of the World newspaper for contacting us with the information that started this investigation," he said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The secretary general of the 45-member pan-European rights watchdog Council of Europe on Thursday welcomed the prospect of former Communist Poland taking over the chairmanship of the body for the first time. "I am very much looking forward to the chairmanship of Poland," Terry Davis told reporters after meeting Foreign Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz. "Poland has an important geographic, historical and political position. It is going to take a very active role as a bridge between western and eastern Europe," he added. In mid-November new EU member Poland is taking over the six-month presidency of the organization for the first time in its history. Warsaw on May 16-17 will host a summit of heads of state of the Council of Europe, the third to be organised by the Strasbourg-based body. The first took place in Vienna in 1993, following the fall of Communism and the establishment of new democracies in central and eastern Europe. The second summit, held in Strasbourg in 1997, gave a new impetus to human rights protection, including the decision to set up a Human Rights Commissioner for Europe.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[DAMASCUS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Frenchman presenting himself as an unofficial negotiator said on Friday that he was with two French reporters being held hostage in Iraq, raising hopes that the men may soon be freed. Philippe Brett said in a radio interview given by mobile telephone that he was currently in Iraq but would not say where exactly. When asked if he was was with Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France Internationale, both of whom were kidnapped August 20 along with their Syrian driver south of Baghdad, Brett told the Europe 1 station: "The response is yes." He added: "I think that within the next 10 hours or so, I'll be able to (talk to you) with a great deal of pleasure." French MP Didier Julia, considered the leader of the unofficial negotiating team, later said in Damascus that Brett was en route for the Syrian capital, but declined to say whether the missing journalists were with him. "Concerning the presence of the French journalists, I will only communicate (that information) when I have them in front of me," said Julia, a member of President Jacques Chirac's UMP party and vice president of the Iraqi-French Friendship Group. Chesnot, 37, Malbrunot 41, and their Syrian driver Mohammed al-Jundi are being held by a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq. Julia, whose mission has not been officially sanctioned by Paris, told Le Parisien newspaper on Thursday that he met members of the Islamic Army in Iraq in September in Jordan. "They told me they were having big difficulties with the French authorities. So I decided to send in a mission," he said. Following a meeting with the French ambassador to Damascus Friday, Julia said that "we are walking hand in hand with the French (foreign ministry) in this business," despite the fact that Chirac and the foreign ministry have both distanced themselves from Julia's initiative. Meanwhile, a senior French foreign ministry official arrived in Jordan early Friday as part of mounting efforts to secure the journalists' release. Jean-Pierre Lafon will "work on the fate of the hostages," Ambassador Jean Michel Caza said, without providing details. "He is here, he is working and we do not know how long he will be here." Julia's aides in Damascus said the journalists' release depended on the security situation around the rebel-held town of Fallujah, west of Baghdad. "Their liberation is assured, but their exit is being blocked by American bombardment in the Fallujah area. We are trying to ensure safe passage for the intermediary who is to go and bring the journalists out to Baghdad before they leave Iraq for France," Philippe Evano told AFP. "The two journalists were kidnapped by highway bandits and then were handed over to the resistance who now want to set them free, but only if they can do it in total security," Evano said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[India stocks seen holding firm next week on results, new tax policy.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BOMBAY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indian shares are seen continuing their upward rally next week ahead of key September quarter results and as investors put their funds in Indian equities on a new attractive tax policy effective Friday, dealers said. The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index closed Friday at 5,675.54, up 147.79. Dealers said the near-term trend would be guided by corporate performances for the September quarter, with investors keenly awaiting results and earnings forecasts from companies such as Infosys, Wipro, Reliance and Tata Consultancy Services. "Next week would open on a strong wicket after Friday's strong closing," said Prakash Lala, managing director of Centaur Capital Market. "Investors would accumulate positions in key counters ahead of the results of those companies, especially in the software sector." He said a firm trend in the global market since Thursday was likely to be carried forward next week, also helping sentiment in Indian equities. Lala said retail investors were back with a bang in the market, the key driving factor being the new capital gains tax policy. "Retail investors are expected to be large buyers after the new short-term and long-term capital gains tax policy became effective from Friday," he said. The new policy sees tax on transactions settled within a year dropped to 10 percent against 30 percent charged earlier, and no levy on transactions settled after one year against the previous 10 percent. "This policy makes our equity market very attractive now, which was also one of the significant reasons for Friday's gains," Lala said. The index rose 1.64 percent on Friday. Dealers said Thursday's news of a robust 7.4 percent growth rate of the economy during the June quarter would also keep the sentiment in the market upbeat in the near-term. "A healthy growth rate of the economy had offered the necessary impetus for investors," said Anish Marfatia, vice president at Parag Parekh Advisory Services. He said the positive mood of foreign investors would continue in the near-term on the back of these developments. Foreign investors, the key drivers of the Indian markets since 2003, have invested nearly half-a-billion dollars in September in Indian equities. They had invested over seven billion dollars in 2003, which pushed the market up by 73 percent over 2002. Another dealer said reports that corporate India had lined up projects worth over 100 billion dollars over the next few years also offered a push to investors. The Economic Times Friday said that corporates, especially state-run companies, had planned investments worth over 100 billion dollars, which potentially could transfer the face of the economy. "It is a positive story and the government is giving a clear message that economic growth would not be compromised," the dealer said. In May Indian stock markets p recovery, the momentum of German exports will ease next year," said DIHK's chief economist Axel Nitschke.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Russia's defense minister warned Friday that the military stood on the verge of collapse because people were avoiding the draft and less than 10 percent of those eligible were showing up at enlistment stations. Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said in televised remarks that 176,000 soldiers would be enlisted in the October-December draft season -- less then one in every 10 of the people eligible for the draft. "By comparison I can say that just 10 years ago, in 1994, we called up 30 percent of all of those eligible. Now it is less than 10 percent. "This really is a critical line and we cannot go any lower, otherwise we will simply lose our armed forces," Ivanov said at a military base in the central Russian town of Oryol. Russian men must serve for at least two years in the armed forces some time between the ages of 18 and 27, depending on whether they go to university. But an embedded fear of service in a cash-strapped military, where morale is low and cases of brutal and often deadly hazing are on the rise, have spun a web of ways out of the draft -- from false medical certificates to direct bribes. President Vladimir Putin had put Ivanov -- the country's first civilian defense minister and the Russian leader's close political ally -- in charge of army reforms in 2001, but his efforts have so far seem to have produced few concrete results. Russia plans to boost its defense budget by nearly one third next year.]]></c>

"These are partial and preliminary results but the analysis carried out could have eliminated the possibility that they are Christopher Columbus's bones," Jose Lorente, director of the genetic identification laboratory at Granada University, told a news conference in Madrid. "Well, it does not eliminate it." Lorente is supervising the team that has been carrying out for the last year DNA studies of the remains, said to be those of Columbus, who sailed to the New World in 1492, his brother Hernando and his son Diego. "The trouble is that I have never come across bone fragments in such bad condition." The Dominican Republic in the Caribbean argues that the remains of the great navigator are on its territory at the Columbus lighthouse in Santo Domingo.]]></c>

The ISM index fell to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 percent in August. The decline was in line with expectations, with Wall Street analysts expecting a figure of 58.3. Any number above 50 indicates expansion, and the ISM said September marked the 16th straight month of expansion. Among the various components of the report, new orders fell to 58.1 in September from 61.2 in August. The employment index rose to 58.1 in September from 55.7 in August. "The manufacturing sector continued to grow during September, but at a slightly slower rate," said ISM survey chief Norbert Ore.

		<d><![CDATA[THE HAGUE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) on Friday started collecting blood samples from refugees from the Balkan wars of the 1990s, in order to identify thousands of nameless victims exhumed from mass graves across the former Yugoslavia. Teams from the commission will operate drop-in centres in cities across Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Switzerland until October 10, to allow refugees to give blood samples. Similar operations had already been conducted within the former Yugoslavia, including in Bosnia where the ICMP is headquartered, but it is the first time the commission had taken its work outside the region. The procedure takes just a few seconds -- a few drops collected on a piece of white paper are enough to obtain a DNA identification. Some 25,000 people are still declared as missing following the Balkan wars, including around 20,000 in Bosnia-Hercegovina alone, according to ICMP figures. According to Asta Zinbo, director of the ICMP's civil society initiatives program, refugees from Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo or Serbia can greatly increase their chances of tracking down missing relatives by giving blood. The commission hopes to gather up to 10,000 samples during the operation, which could help to identify between 3,000 and 4,000 bodies. The ICMP is a inter-governmental organisation founded in 1996 to help tackle the issue of missing persons across the war-torn Balkans.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[One of four Britons still held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba claims in a letter released by lawyers Friday that he has been subjected to "vindictive torture" and death threats. Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, in the English Midlands, also claimed in a hand-written letter -- which somehow passed censorship -- that he had witnessed the deaths of two fellow detainees "at the hands of US military personnel". Begg, 36, who has been detained for more than two years, insisted he was a law-abiding British citizen, that he had never met Osama Bin Laden, and was not a member of al-Qaeda or any other paramilitary organisation. His four-page letter, made public in London by his lawyers, marked the first time that any communication from a serving Guantanamo detainee has been made public, the attorneys said. "During several interviews, particularly -- though unexclusively -- in Afghanistan, I was subjected to pernicious threats of torture, actual vindictive torture and death threats - amongst other coercively employed interrogation techniques," Begg wrote. He added: "In this atmosphere of severe antipathy towards detainees was the compounded use of racially and religiously prejudiced taunts," he said. "This culminated, in my opinion, with the deaths of two fellow detainees at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness," he alleged. Begg, who was arrested in Pakistan in February 2002, was among nine Britons known to have been detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, of whom four were released last March, then released upon their arrival home without charge. Three of them have since alleged in a dossier published in July that they had been abused while in US captivity. The remaining four -- Begg; and Feroz Abbasi, 23, Martin Mubanga, 29, and Richard Belmar, 23, all of London -- face trial by military tribunals for alleged involvement in global terrorism.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Palestinian militants fired two makeshift rockets on Sderot in southern Israel Friday without causing any casualties, an army spokeswoman told AFP. "One rocket landed in an open field and the second one inside the town. There are no casualties or damages," she said. The attack, staged from the northern Gaza Strip, occurred despite the massive presence of Israeli armor in that territory with the self-declared objective to stop the firing. The Popular Resistance Committees, a radical Palestinian group mostly made up of former activists with Palestinian leader's mainstream Fatah, claimed the attack. A senior Israeli official said Friday the army was about to take a six-kilometer (four-mile) deep strech of land in the nothern Gaza Strip to serve as a buffer zone and keep militants away from targets in southern Israel. Fourty-five Palestinians have been killed since tanks first rolled into Jabaliya, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanun three days ago. Two soldiers and a settler were killed in Gaza gunbattles and two Israeli toddlers died in a rocket attack on Sderot during the same period.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LE HAVRE, France, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Fishermen angry at skyrocketing oil prices on Friday blocked ports in north and northwest France including Calais, Le Havre and Boulogne-sur-Mer, disrupting cross-Channel ferry traffic for hours. "This is not a true strike today, it's a warning shot," said Christian Dubois, who works out of the Channel port of Calais. Alexis Maheut, president of the Upper Normandy regional fishermen's committee, said high oil prices were making work "impossible" for him and his colleagues. "Diesel oil is one of our primary expenses after social charges, and when we know that the price of diesel oil has gone up 34 percent since the start of the year, it's not hard for us to see that we're in a tough spot," Maheut said. The blockade lasted for about four hours, from 10:00 am (0800 GMT) to 2:00 pm (1200 GMT). Some 100 fishermen who gathered in Boulogne-sur-Mer demanded that the center-right government allocate a 200-million-euro (248-million-dollar) aid package for the industry. "Since February, no one has listened to us. The agriculture minister is a honest guy, but everything goes through Bercy (the finance ministry). We've been taken for a ride," said Pierre-Georges Dachicourt, head of the National Fishermen's Committee (CNP). An interministerial meeting on aid to fishermen to resolve the positions of the agriculture and finance ministries took place Thursday, but sources said the finance ministry had yet to agree to several measures. Agriculture Minister Herve Gaymard was due to meet with representatives of fishermen's organizations on Tuesday. Oil prices hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in out-of-hours deals in New York on Tuesday and 46.80 dollars in London.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[German airline Lufthansa is making good progress with its 1.2-euro-billion (1.5-billion-dollar) cost-cutting programme, but high fuel prices are partly negating the effects, the chairman of the German flag carrier said in a magazine interview released Friday. "Of the 1.2 billion euros we're planning in cost cuts, we will achieve 320 million euros this year," Lufthansa chairman Wolfgang Mayrhuber told the latest edition of the fortnightly specialist travel industry magazine FVW International. "But unfortunately, we're getting some headwind from high fuel prices. Even the best hedging has its limits," Mayrhuber said. Nevertheless, hedging "is acting like a bumper. It's putting us in a relatively better position than our rivals," he added. The high price of kerosene would "separate the wheat from the chaff" in the airline industry, Mayrhuber said. "Some airlines can no longer even afford to hedge against it. Our costs, too, are being driven higher, even if not as fast as with our rivals."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Turkey has made significant reforms to prepare to one day join the European Union, but in many key areas they still fall short, according to an EU report revealed Friday ahead of its publication next week. The report, first published by France's Le Monde newspaper and seen by AFP in Brussels, listed a series of areas where Turkey has shown a "a substantial institutional convergence. towards European standards," These include the abolition of the death penalty, a crackdown on torture, a reduction in the role the powerful military in society and increased tolerance for the Kurdish population, it said. "Following decades of sporadic progress and partly because of a political consolidation after the 2002 elections, there has been a substantial institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards," it said. Nevertheless, its publication next Wednesday will also highlight shortcomings. "Although torture is no longer systematic, numerous cases of torture and in particular ill-treatment still continue to occur and further efforts will be required to eradicate such practice," the report said. Complaints of torture outside of official detention centres considerably increased in the first half of 2003, it said. Army chiefs who in the past stepped in to shape the direction of Turkey continue to exert influence through a series of informal channels, it lamented. In addition new laws are often interpreted restrictively, religious minorities are not accorded the same rights as citizens from the Muslim majority, and human rights activists remain subject to harrassment, it said. Turkey has been seeking EU membership since 1963 but the bid has been controversial, with many existing EU member states questioning whether the largely Muslim nation of some 70 million could fit easily into the bloc.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and his Portuguese counterpart Pedro Santana Lopes opened a summit meeting in this northwestern Spanish city on Friday to cement relations strained by disagreement over Iraq. The political climate has changed in both countries since both countries under former prime ministers Jose Maria Aznar and Jose Manuel Durao Barroso backed the US-led intervention in Iraq last year. Zapatero took offimental problems with both countries having suffered the ravages of summer forest fires. The summiteers were due to fix June 30 next year as the date for the belated launch of a joint electricity market which has been in the offing for three years. A joint Iberian market would likely afford cheaper electricity to 53 million people through the liberalisation of the industry in both countries. Both leaders were also set to confirm a timetable for opening up high-speed rail links between their respective countries with a Madrid to Lisbon link due to come on stream in 2010 a year after the northern cities of Porto and Vigo are linked.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Birdie blitz catapults Els into lead by Erskine McCullough =.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[KILKENNY, Ireland, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A birdie blitz catapulted Ernie Els to the top of the leaderboard at the WGC American Express championship here on Friday. The South African, who had warned before the tournament that he was raring to go after a two week lay-off, opened his second round with four straight birdies to move to seven-under and one ahead of first round leader Todd Hamilton who had just teed off. Els reached the turn in 31 when he birdied the ninth but the gap with Hamilton remained at one as the American birdied his second hole. But then Els moved to nine-under with a birdie at the 10th and the gap widened to two. But with eight holes to play, Els still had plenty of work left to do to keep his place atop the leaderboard. Unlike on Thursday when conditions were ideal, the players were having to compete with driving rain squalls which were interrupted from time to time with a brief glimpse of the sun. The early morning starters saw none of the sun as rain poured down but despite the conditions Fred Couples shot a brilliant five-under 67 to move to four-under for the tournament. Sergio Garcia, who began the day only one back off the lead, got the worst possible start when he dropped his drive on the par three third into the pond guarding the green. The Spaniard ran up a double bogey and was suddenly five behind the charging Els. Tiger Woods, still clearly suffering from the shoulder injury that dogged him on Thursday, continued to fight through the pain. Two birdies after only seven holes took him to six-under and firmly in touch as he chases his third straight win in the championship. Ireland's Padraig Harrington was giving the local fans brave enough to battle the elements something to smile about as he was two-under for his round after 12 holes. It put the world number eight at five-under. Angel Cabrera was on one of his famed hot streaks as he carded three birdies after only eight holes to go to six-under. With the greens softened by the rain, birdies were there to be had but American Chad Campbell, who started his second round at two-under par, found himself racing back down the leaderboard as he collected two double bogeys in his opening three holes. Another at the ninth and suddenly Campbell reached the turn seven-over for his round and four-over for the championship. Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee, struggling in the rain, went out in five-over 41 but a hole-in-one at the 169-yard 11th gave him something to finally smile about. It was his second hole-in-one in Europe this year. Earlier he had holed in one at the PGA Championship at Wentworth.]]></c>

Saddam's still fugitive number two, Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, had two homes on the city's outskirts that were bombed by the US military last year and Samarra has proved a tougher nut for the US-led coalition crack than the two men's hometown of Tikrit further north. Municipal and tribal leaders charge that repeated US-led counter-insurgency operations in the city since last autumn have only strengthened support for the rebels among a population that fared relatively well under Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime.

		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov warned Friday that the Russian armed forces were on the verge of collapse because people were avoiding the draft and less than 10 percent of those eligible were showing up at enlistment stations. Ivanov said in televised remarks that 176,000 soldiers would be enlisted in the October-December draft season -- less than one in every 10 of the people eligible for the draft. "By comparison I can say that just 10 years ago, in 1994, we called up 30 percent of all of those eligible. Now it is less than 10 percent. "This really is a critical line and we cannot go any lower, otherwise we will simply lose our armed forces," Ivanov said at a military base in the central Russian town of Oryol. Russian men must serve for at least two years in the armed forces some time between the ages of 18 and 27, depending on whether they go to university. But an embedded fear of service in a cash-strapped military, where morale is low and cases of brutal and often deadly hazing are on the rise, have spun a web of ways out of the draft -- from false medical certificates to direct bribes. "We are the champions of the world when it comes to duty deferments," Ivanov quipped. One reason Russians fear the draft is Chechnya, where war has been waged nearly without interruption for the past decade, with the last campaign launched five years ago Friday. A band of several thousand guerrillas has been standing up against a Russian contingent of up to 80,000 soldiers, with the war now a deadly stalemate with casualties -- including those civilians -- reported on an almost daily basis. Soldiers' rights committees have complained that Russian teenagers with only a few months training were being thrown into one of the deadliest war zones on earth. Ivanov said Friday that none of the people called up this fall season would be posted in Chechnya, ITAR-TASS reported. Russia had earlier aired plans to have its Chechnya force made up entirely of professional soldiers starting January 1. President Vladimir Putin had put Ivanov -- the country's first civilian defense minister and the Russian leader's close political ally -- in charge of army reforms in 2001, but his efforts have so far seem to have produced few concrete results. Russia plans to boost its defense budget by nearly one third next year, in part due to a wave of terror attacks linked to Chechen militants that killed hundreds in Russia this year.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[THE HAGUE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) on Friday started collecting blood samples from refugees from the Balkan wars of the 1990s, in order to identify thousands of nameless victims exhumed from mass graves across the former Yugoslavia. Teams from the commission will operate drop-in centres in cities across Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Switzerland until October 10, to allow refugees to give blood samples. Similar operations had already been conducted within the former Yugoslavia, including in Bosnia where the ICMP is headquartered, but it is the first time the commission had taken its work outside the region. The procedure takes just a few seconds -- a few drops collected on a piece of white paper are enough to obtain a DNA identification. Suada Pasic, dressed in an elegant green suit, was the first to give blood at the centre in The Hague on Friday. Her sample will be analysed and its DNA compared to that of bodies exhumed from mass graves. "I lost my brother in the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 but his body was never recovered. For the past nine years, I have been trying to find out what happened, I have been living with these questions so I came here to give blood," said Suada, who has lived in the Netherlands for the past 11 years. "I hope that we will be able to find his body and give him a dignified burial," she added. "It is a terrible thing to lose someone, but even worse not to know where they are." More than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were slaughtered when Bosnian Serb forces overran the UN-run enclave of Srebenica in July 1995, and many of the bodies have never been recovered.]]></c>

"Following decades of sporadic progress and partly because of a political consolidation after the 2002 elections, there has been a substantial institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards," it said. The Commission, the EU's executive arm, is widely expected to recommend in its report to be published on October 6 that the EU start membership negotiations with Turkey. The leaked report does not include those all-important recommendations, which will form the basis for a final decision to be made by EU leaders at a mid-December summit on whether to give the green light for talks with Ankara. Turkey's EU hopes were brought back on track at the weekend, when the Turkish parliament passed a reformed penal code demanded by the EU if it is to win a green light from Brussels. EU enlargement commissioner said after those reforms were agreed that there were "no more obstacles on the table" to Turkey's EU hopes. But the report revealed Friday also highlights shortcomings in Turkey's EU preparations. "Although torture is no longer systematic, numerous cases of torture and in particular ill-treatment still continue to occur and further efforts will be required to eradicate such practice," the report said.

Turkey has been seeking EU membership since 1963 but the bid has been controversial, with many existing EU member states questioning whether the largely Muslim nation of some 70 million could fit easily into the bloc. Separately, an "impact study" to be published alongside next Wednesday's report says that Turkey's EU entry should be good news if well managed, although Ankara may have to wait until "well into the next decade" to join. "Accession of Turkey to the Union would be challenging both for the EU and Turkey. If well managed, it would offer important opportunities for both," said the study, leaked on Thursday. "The necessary preparations for accession will last well into the next decade. The EU will evolve over this period and Turkey should change even more radically," it said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Around 4,000 university students protested outside the Russian government headquarters here Friday against legislation they say could end free higher education and curtail social benefits, an AFP reporter saw. "One-third of students will not be able to study any longer if this law goes into effect," said Oleg Denisov, president of the Russian Association of Student Unions which organized the demonstration. The new measures on higher education were contained in legislation reducing many Soviet-era social benefits that was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin on August 22 and that was to take effect in phases over coming months. "According to our calculations, every student will have to pay 2,000 dollars" annually to receive higher education, Denisov said. He said Friday's protest would be followed by a demonstration "50 times as big" if the government did not agree to negotiate with student unions. In addition to free education, university students in Russia have also been entitled to free health coverage and reduced prices for public transportation. Students also protested Friday in several other Russian cities, NTV television reported. Education Minister Andrei Fursenko defended the new legislation, but also said he was willing to discuss it with student leaders.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[First Bush-Kerry debate, a tie: US press (CORRECTION on vote in para four).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Both President George W. Bush and his Democratic rival John Kerry forcefully defended their positions on Iraq, and their first televised debate was enough of a tie to entice voters on to their next encounter, leading US dailies agreed Friday. "If Americans who tuned into last night's presidential debate were waiting for one of the candidates to catch the other in a fatal error, or leave him stammering, the event was obviously a draw," wrote The New York Times. The daily, however, gave Kerry points for looking presidential, keeping Bush on the defensive, arguing that Iraq had nothing to do with the war on terror and that Bush rushed into the war without an exit strategy. "It is the the strongest and most sensible critique of the administration's actions," the Times said, adding that Kerry had also "found an effective answer" to his dubious vote against 87 billion dollars in war appropriations by comparing his mistake to Bush's mistake in going to war. Despite the controlled environment of the debate, the Times concluded, the discussion "seemed like a breath of fresh air" to a campaign starved for real substance. USA Today leaves the verdict on the first presidential debate "up to every viewer," adding that both candidates for the November 2 election had left voters with much to ponder -- "each impressively arguing his case." "In shorthand, the choice is this: A president who will act independently and quickly, even at the risk of alienating allies or making a grievous mistake. Or one who will proceed more deliberately in concert with allies, potentially at the price of missing a crucial opportunity," said the nationally-distributed daily. The Los Angeles Times presented its readers with what it believes is the real conundrum: "Kerry won Thursday night's debate on foreign policy by a comfortable margin, but Americans may yet decide that President Bush is better able to clean up the mess he created in Iraq." Kerry "delivered a powerful indictment of Bush's foreign policy record" but now faces "the inescapable quandary. that it cannot offer a clear alternative for what needs to happen in Iraq going forward." While a majority of Americans feel the Iraq war was not worth fighting, said the daily citing recent polls, "more people trusted Bush over Kerry to develop a plan for succeeding there. "Kerry doesn't have a magic wand to undo Bush's mistakes, and it must be frustrating to him that many voters feel as if they are stuck with the incumbent," added the Los Angeles Times editorial. "Mr Bush stoutly defended his decision to go to war and its results; Mr Kerry forcefully criticized that decision and the war's management. " said The Washington Post. Kerry had "a more complicated position to defend, and it showed at times," said the daily. "He called the war a mistake and a diversion, but later said that American soldiers were not dying for a mistake." Bush, on the other hand, was "skillfull and relentless in underlining these 'mixed messages' and in outlining his goal that success in Iraq and on other fronts is equally vital to US security." However, the Post added, "Bush's clarity in defining goals was not matched with candor about conditions on the ground in Iraq," and Kerry was effective in stressing how the nuclear threat from North Korea and Iran has increased under Bush's watch. "Both performed credibly enough to keep voters tuned in for the next debate," concluded the Post.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Supporters of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic gave a hostile welcome Friday to chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte as she visited Belgrade to attend a conference, witnesses said. Riot police were on hand as a group of around 30 protesters gathered outside a Belgrade hotel where Del Ponte attended the start of a conference on war crimes, amid mounting pressure on Belgrade to hand over fugitive indictees. The protesters waved banners in support of Milosevic, who is on trial at the UN war crimes court at The Hague for his role in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. It is the prosecutor's first visit to Belgrade since October, when she delivered indictments against four Serbian generals charged with war crimes allegedly committed during the 1998-99 Kosovo conflict. She is due to meet Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica during a return visit on Monday, when she is expected to demand the arrest of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic and the four generals. Her trip comes a day after US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Marc Grossman and the US senior envoy for war crimes, Pierre-Richard Prosper, visited Belgrade to step up pressure on Serbia to arrest war crimes suspects. But despite the withholding of badly needed US aid and threats of sanctions, Kostunica has said the stability of the Balkan country is more important than arresting war crimes suspects. He has also maintained that local courts should be able to prosecute war crimes cases which have yet to be heard at The Hague. Del Ponte said cases could be transferred as early as next year but Serbian courts had to prove they were ready to handle them. "Local prosecutors and judges have to be focused more and more on building capacity for domestic war crimes prosecutions," she said, adding such cases would be "a very serious test" for domestic courts and institutions. Grossman told reporters after meeting Serbian leaders that "the deadline was yesterday" for arresting Mladic, and warned Serbia it faced international isolation if it continued to obstruct the UN tribunal at The Hague. Mladic and Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic were charged in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Bosnia's 1992-95 war. A Belgrade court issued warrants for the arrest of the four generals earlier this week but they remain comfortably at large. One of the four, police general Sreten Lukic, responded Thursday to a court summons and formally received the indictment, but he was not arrested, a court spokeswoman told AFP. Spokeswoman Sonja Prostran said the former deputy interior minister was "informed about the charges and a demand on his transfer (to The Hague)." Lukic was the chief of Serbian police forces in Kosovo under the overall command of then-Yugoslav president Milosevic. The other three generals have failed to appear in court.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Italian authorities Friday deported around 90 Libyan illegal immigrants some 24 hours after their arrival on the outlying island of Lampedusa, the ANSA news agency reported. Police escorted the group onto an Alitalia plane bound for the Libyan capital Tripoli, the agency said. An Italian interior ministry spokesman was unavailable for comment. If confirmed, it would be the first time Italy has deported illegal immigrants to Libya, one of the main sources of rampant illegal immigration to Italy. European Union interior ministers were meeting in the Netherlands on Friday to discuss the problem. The Italian coastguard said more than 800 would-be immigrants had arrived on Lampedusa since Wednesday night, inundating the local reception centre designed to house only 200 people. Normally, illegal immigrants are held at the centre where they receive medical aid, food and shelter, before being taken to other reception centres in southern Italy where their applications for refugee status are processed. Earlier this month Italian officials said nearly 10,000 illegal immigrants had arrived in the country during 2004, including a record 650 who arrived in Lampedusa at the start of this month. The island, which is located halfway between Sicily and the north African coast, is a popular landing point for migrants from Africa hoping to enter Europe illegally. To stem the flow, Italy and Libya have reached a deal under which Italian officials will help train and equip Libyan authorities to better control land and sea borders. Rome is also pressing for the creation of holding centres in north Africa for would-be immigrants.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MADRID, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Spain's main conservative opposition Popular Party (PP) gathered Friday for its national congress, six months after it suffered a shock general election defeat in the wake of the Madrid train bombings. The PP hierarchy, which strongly backed the US-led war in Iraq, insisted Basque extremists were responsible for the killing of 191 people last March 11 in Spain's worst ever terrorist attack, even as evidence emerged that Islamic extremists were responsible. Some voters interpreted the government's stance as a deliberate bid to mislead them and instead of the PP celebrating a third straight general election victory as earlier polls had indicated it was the Socialist Party which triumphed. Defeated PP candidate Mariano Rajoy was to pick up the pieces at the party's 15th national congress which will this weekend confirm him as party chairman. But Rajoy, though certain to receive the backing of the majority of the 3,028 delegates, has to prove to a wider audience than the congress itself that he can deliver a new and vibrant party. Jose Maria Aznar, prime minister from 1996 to 2004 and who personally anointed Rajoy as his choice of successor six months before the election, is due to become honorary president this weekend, leading observers to speculate that he will continue to pull strings. Further complicating the task of making a fresh start is the lingering presence of 81-year-old Manuel Fraga, the last heavyweight survivor from the days of General Francisco Franco's military dictatorship. Fraga says he plans to keep on playing a major part in political life from his Galician fiefdom in the northwest, but the Popular Party is divided at regional level over his role. After showing itself under Aznar to be out of step with the public at large over Iraq the PP is now up against a Socialist government which is doggedly pursuing a markedly liberal social agenda, set to include the legalisation of gay marriage. Two-thirds of voters support the Socialists' progressive agenda. At least as damaging is a recent poll by Cadena Ser radio showing that 55.9 percent of Spaniards see Aznar as the power behind Rajoy's throne. Rajoy set the tone Friday as he told the rightwing daily La Razon that "our objective must be to convince, our goal to win the next general election." He reasserted that the PP believed Spain should target full employment and economic modernbisation. Meanwhile the mayor of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, who was to make the opening speech to delegates and is seen as a future potential leader, said the party must recover the centre ground. "Most of the Spanish people are moderates. We will not return to government in 2008 unless we take a decisive step towards the centre," he told ABC daily.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Darleen Druyun, a former Air Force official charged in a deal that allowed her to get a job with Boeing after overseeing a controversial deal on tanker planes, was sentenced Friday to nine months in prison, officials said. Druyun had pleaded guilty earlier this year to a criminal conspiracy charge for her role in the deal that gave her a lucrative job with the aerospace company after she pressed for a lease agreement on refueling aircraft. A spokeswoman for the US Attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia, said Druyun's sentence also calls for seven months community confinement after release from prison, three years probation, 150 hours of community service and a 5,000 dollar fine. Druyun, who was the principal deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition and management, helped negotiate the 2002 deal with the Boeing Company to lease 100 Boeing 767 tanker aircraft for the Air Force for more than 20 billion dollars. She accepted a job with Boeing in January 2003 as vice-president and deputy general manager of the Missile Defense Systems. Prosecutors said Druyun's daughter, herself a Boeing employee, contacted a senior executive of Boeing in September 2002, setting in motion a process in which Druyun worked out a deal to retire from the Air Force and accept a the senior position at Boeing.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LOSAIL, Qatar, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Spain's Carlos Checa took pole position in the Qatar motorcycling grand prix at the brand new circuit here on Friday for this 13th round of the 16-race world championship. The time of 1:58.988, by the Gauloises-Fortuna Yamaha teammate of overall leader Valentina Rossi, was, of course, a circuit record and he finished ahead of Brazilian Alex Barros, Spain's Sete Gibernau, American Nicky Hayden and Japan's Shinya Nakano. Barros, who is in fourth spot overall, got the better of Gibernau, second overall, as he did in the last two races but only by 0.007sec. Gibernau has work to do to catch Rossi however with his 39-point deficit with three races to go in this year's series. Anyone riding aggressively will have to be very careful to avoid any pitfalls because of the narrowness of this circuit in parts. Rossi could only finish in eighth place, 0.508sec behind Checa, and the difficulty in passing on this circuit could hamper his progress, having already ridden off the track several times in free practice and qualifying. Many riders and officials are even fearing a mass fall as happened at the start of the Japanese grand prix two weeks ago involving six riders. Italy's Max Biaggi could only finish 12th and, as he starts away from the front, is more likely to avoid any such danger. In the 250cc section, the Aprilia of Argentina's Sebastian Porto took pole position ahead of overall leader Daniel Pedrosa of Spain, and Spain's Jorge Lorenzo took pole position on his Derbi in the 125cc race.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Serbian Orthodox Church on Friday threw its weight behind calls for ethnic Serbs to boycott elections in the UN-administered southern province of Kosovo next month due to security fears. The Saint Sinod issued a statement backing boycott calls by the ruling coalition government of Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica despite mounting international pressure for Serbs to particpate in the October 23 poll. It said Serbs should not take part until they are given credible security guarantees from international peacekeeping forces in the breakaway, mainly ethnic Albanian province. "Nothing which in the civilised world is called human rights or the rights of citizens exists for the Serbs in Kosovo," the Sinod said according to the Beta news agency. "Consequently, the Saint Sinod calls on political parties in Serbia to not encourage Serbs to participate in the elections as long as they have not obtained guarantees that their engagement in local institutions will ensure the survival of the Serb people in the province and the effective protection of their properties, churches and culture." Anti-Serb riots by separatist ethnic Albanian mobs killed 19 people in March and destroyed hundreds of Serb homes and churches, incuding some which dated back to the Middle Ages. Kostunica has called on Serbs to boycott the parliamentary elections in protest against the UN's refusal to accept his plans for greater autonomy for Serb communities in Kosovo. The southern province is the traditional seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church and remains technically part of Serbia, although it has been under UN administration since the end of the 1998-99 war between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Demonstrators in the southwest of the Caucasus republic of Georgia staged protests Friday against the building of an oil pipeline through their district, a local television station reported. Inhabitants of Akhaltsikhe blocked a dozen trucks carrying pipes belonging the oil company British Petroleum (BP). BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey on the Mediterranean. The townspeople complain that convoys of trucks carrying material for the project have wrecked roads in the area and are demanding compensation, the Imedi television station said. Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They pointed out that their homes are in an area with a high earthquake risk and call for the pipeline to be banned. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks. They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291 dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline. BP has not so far reacted to the demands. In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest by environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline, which is due to come into service next year. The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to Turkey.]]></c>

"This is a major step forward for our company, its employees, customers and all other stakeholders," said Bruce Lakefield, US Airways president and chief executive officer, after the deal with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), representing some 3,200 US Airways pilots. "Ratification by ALPA's members is essential to our transformation and would demonstrate their continuing commitment to making our airline stronger and more competitive."

		<t><![CDATA[Bush, Kerry hit the campaign trail running after debate.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TAMPA, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Each claiming victory in their first debate, President George W. Bush and Democratic White House hopeful John Kerry on Friday courted voters in key up-for-grabs states 32 days before the election. The challenger, who told Bush in their face-to-face exchange on Thursday that his Iraq war was "a colossal error in judgment," campaigned in hotly contested Florida, which decided the disputed 2000 election. The Republican president, who accused his rival of alienating allies and emboldening enemies with "mixed messages" about whether the March 2003 invasion was worth the cost, was to woo supporters in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Kerry hoped to capitalize on solid reviews of his performance in the first of three debates to erode Bush's steady edge in national polls as well as in the handful of battleground states that will decide the November 2 vote. A Gallup poll for CNN gave Kerry a 46 percent to 37 percent win over the president but the survey said Bush still had the support of 51 percent of voters against 47 percent for Kerry. "What the American people saw last night is what I have known all along, which is John Kerry has strength, he has conviction. He's completely prepared to be commander in chief," Democratic vice presidential hopeful John Edwards told NBC. "How can you expect a leader to prevail in Iraq, in a mission they don't believe in." White House communications director Dan Bartlett told Fox News Channel. Experts warned that early post-debate polls tend to have high error margins, and that it will take days to get an accurate assessment of the exchange's impact on what is one of the hardest fought campaigns in recent US history. But many also agreed that the close-fought debate raised the stakes for the second presidential face-off, set for October 8. A third is scheduled for October 13. As tens of millions of Americans watched, Kerry made some of his toughest charges yet against Bush, saying his upbeat rhetoric on Iraq did not match the brutal realities on the ground, and branding the invasion to topple Saddam Hussein a monumental mistake that has left US alliances "in shatters" National security was the agreed-upon theme, but Iraq dominated as the two candidates battled over how to stabilize that war-torn country, where more than 1,000 US soldiers have died amid deadly chaos that shows no sign of ebbing. The two also clashed on approaches to the North Korean nuclear crisis -- Bush warning against Kerry's call for bilateral talks -- and to Iran's nuclear program and how to prevent Tehran from acquiring atomic weapons. But both agreed that the most serious threat to US national security was the possibility that terrorists like Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network might get their hands on nuclear materials. Leading US 000 Republican party presidential hopeful Senator John McCain said he thought it was a good debate. "I thought that John Kerry did a good job style-wise. I think that the president was very convincing in his conviction that what he has done is right, what he will do is correct," McCain said on CNN. Former Democratic Texas Governor Ann Richards, bested by Bush in debates a decade ago, said Kerry appeared to be someone ready to assume the mantle of commander in chief. "I was really pleased. we were all really nervous going into this debate and I thought that John Kerry knocked it out of the ballpark," Richards said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Days before the European Union publishes a report about the progress of reforms in Turkey, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denied that torture takes place in his country. Turkey did not carry out torture and human rights groups who claimed otherwise were "blinded by ideology", Erdogan told the German newspaper Der Tagesspiel in an advance extract of its Saturday edition. The EU report, which is due to be published next Wednesday but has been seen by France's Le Monde newspaper and AFP, is crucial to Turkey's hopes of joining the European Union. It says "although torture is no longer systematic, numerous cases of torture and in particular ill-treatment still continue to occur and further efforts will be required to eradicate such practice". Although the German newspaper had not seen the EU report before it interviewed Erdogan, he was asked about reports from human rights groups that torture still took place in Turkey. "There is no torture in my country," Erdogan said. "In all these reports about torture, what is missing is proof. There is no systematic torture. That is also what the (EU) investigations showed, which Commissioner (Guenter) Verheugen ordered after his visit to the PKK area." The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), now known as KONGRA-GEL, has been fighting rule from Ankara for 20 years. Asked if reform would continue even if the EU decided against inviting Turkey to membership talks, Erdogan told the paper: "I don't even want to think about that possibility. That would be a tough blow for me personally and for my people." Erdogan will receive a prestigious prize in Berlin on Sunday for showing courage and vision in the reform process.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Republican and Democratic leaders on Friday each declared victory after the first head-to-head sparring match between President George W. Bush and Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry. White House communications director Dan Bartlett suggested Bush delivered a knock-out blow when he "again renewed his pledge to the American people about doing everything he could in his power to protect them." Bartlett told ABC television that Bush "felt he clearly articulated to the American people clearly that he has the strategy, the plan and the resolve, as commander in chief, to continue to fight this war on terror and protect the American people." Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards, told NBC television, "I think what the American people saw last night is what I have known all along: which is John Kerry has strength, he has conviction, he's completely prepared to be commander in chief. The problem is the president. "The president, even in the debate last night, still does not acknowledge what the American people see on their television screen everyday. "He never said what he is going to do to change what's happening now" in Iraq, Edwards said, referring to the string of hostage takings, beheadings and clashes between US troops and insurgents in the war-torn country. He said Bush "had a difficult time explaining why Iraq is such a mess or what he was going to do about it last night, and why Iran and North Korea have moved forward with their nuclear weapons program." "We are in this place, as John Kerry said last night, because of this president, because he didn't have a plan for this period of time, because he didn't do the work to build a coalition. "And he's given us no idea about what he's going to do to be successful there, which is why John laid out very clearly his plan last night to achieve success in Iraq." Setting his sights on Kerry, Bartlett repeated Republican charges that the Democratic senator "flip-flops" on Iraq. "You can't say on one hand that it was right to remove Saddam Hussein, to authorize the use of force, and then turn around and say it was the 'wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time,'" Bartlett told NBC. "How can you win in Iraq if you don't believe in the mission." But Edwards said: "John and I believe that with a new president and a fresh start, and particularly with the plan that he laid out last night, that we can be successful in Iraq. "In order to change what's happening there, they have to see this, number one, as an effort to free them and allow them to govern themselves, and number two, as an international effort, not an American occupation." Civil rights leader and activist Jesse Jackson echoed that message in a statement late Thursday, emphasizing the need for international involvement in rebuilding Iraq. "President Bush, the former owner of the Texas Rangers (baseball team), continues to conduct our foreign policy as if he is the Lone Ranger," Jackson lamented. "John Kerry -- who says the president misused the power that Congress gave him -- if elected, would be given the opportunity for a fresh start in Iraq," said Jackson, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988. He said Kerry "has a better chance than George Bush to chart a new course by bringing the international community into the entire situation -- for security and reconstruction, for burden sharing and economic opportunity." More presidential debates are to be held on October 8 and October 13.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[One of four Britons still held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba claims in a letter released by lawyers Friday that he has been subjected to "vindictive torture" and death threats. Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham in the English Midlands, also claimed in a hand-written letter -- which somehow passed censorship -- that he had witnessed the deaths of two fellow detainees "at the hands of US military personnel". Begg, 36, who has been detained for more than two years, insisted he was a law-abiding British citizen, that he had never met Osama Bin Laden, and was not a member of al-Qaeda or any other paramilitary organisation. His four-page letter, made public in London by his lawyers, marked the first time that any communication from a serving Guantanamo detainee has been made public, the attorneys said. "During several interviews, particularly -- though unexclusively -- in Afghanistan, I was subjected to pernicious threats of torture, actual vindictive torturessed "to whom it may concern" at the US Forces Administration at Guantanamo Bay. It was signed with his name and his prisoner number, 00558. He requested at the end of the letter that copies be sent to the Home Secretary, the US Supreme Court, the European Court of Human Rights, Amnesty International, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Begg's US counsel Clive Stafford Smith said he would file a legal demand next Monday to end his client's "inhumane treatment" immediately, and for the US government to publish detailed evidence of Begg's alleged torture. Civil liberties lawyer Gareth Pierce meanwhile called upon the British government to take Begg's letter to the United Nations as evidence of torture, with the demand that the United States be held responsible. "But most importantly in the case of Mr Begg that he is repatriated immediately," she said. "What do we do when Mr Begg's captors are in fact a state, a rogue state, acting wholly illegally."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ANTANANARIVO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Efforts to increase the use of condoms in Madagascar to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS have failed dramatically, largely because of the opposition of church leaders. Just two percent of women and four percent of men questioned by the Indian Ocean island's National Institute of Statistics said they had used a condom during their most recent sexual activity. The survey was carried out between last November and March and involved 7,000 sexually active respondents who knew about the existence of HIV and AIDS. "I am firmly opposed to the use of the condom as a means of fighting AIDS, because it promotes promiscuity," Armand Razafimahefa, until August the head of the country's protestant church, told AFP. "Why not spend this money to find a vaccine for AIDS, instead of promoting condoms. There's lots of money involved," he said. "I agree with the cardinal on this," he added. Cardinal Gaetan Armand Razafindratandra, the bishop of Madagascar, has on several occasions spoken out against the use of condoms. Madagascar's churches -- Roman Catholics, Protestants, Lutherians and Anglicans -- boast between eight to 10 million followers out of a total population of 17 million. At the forefront of condom promotion is a US non-governmental organisation, Population Services International (PSI), which is funded by the US government. PSI has distributed condoms across the island at the subsidised price of 500 francs (four euro cents) a piece. "We sold 11 million in 2003 and believe we have 80 percent of the country covered," PSI Director of Operations in Madagascar Lalah Rambeloson told AFP. "But some outlets refuse (to accept the condoms) or throw them away because of religion," he added. This week, the National Committee for the Fight Against Aids, christened the condom "Fimailo," a word in the Madagascan language meaning "it's good but be careful." "We want to counter the demonisation attempts and make it something people use a lot," explained the committee's executive secretary, Fenosoa Ratsimanetrimanana. The campaign has brought in best-selling pop musicians to spread the word on specially recorded cassettes. Last December, President Marc Ravalomanana declared the fight against AIDS a "national cause." Last year, the government spent 300 million dollars in the campaign against the disease. According to a neonatal survey released in July 2003, the HIV prevalance rate in Madagascar is 1.1 percent. The study, which looked at relatively young pregnant women living in rural areas in Madagascar, found that the rate of HIV-infection among married women -- just over 1.2 percent -- was higher than among their single counterparts. "If married women have AIDS, their husbands do too. And the husband often 'brought it home' after seeing other women who are infected, and so on and so forth," conditions despite the wealth around them. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and OPEC's sixth biggest oil exporter, accounting for some 2.3 million barrels per day. The bulk of it comes from the delta region, where multinationals have their bases in Port Harcourt. As the west African country marked the 44th independence anniversary, people told AFP there was nothing to celebrate, since the vast majority still live in abject poverty. "Much of our oil wealth is stolen by government officials and their cronies. Nothing in terms of development can be felt or seen by the people," said Kingsley Ihua, a 40-year-old rights activist from Ogbakiri, near Port Harcourt. "The situation is more pathetic in the delta. The people in Lagos and Abuja take our oil, develop their areas and live us in abject poverty," he said. "The discovery of oil has been a curse rather than a blessing. The government and oil firms will come, extract oil from our soil and pollute our envirompromise the majority interest. Officials say Nigeria has earned over 360 billion dollars (290 billion euros) since oil was discovered at Oloibiri in southern Rivers State by Anglo-Dutch giant Shell in 1957, but today the country's external debts stand at a staggering 32 billion dollars. Despite the billions earned from oil, Nigeria is listed among 25 poorest countries in the world and placed 146th out of 162 on the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) index of social indicators. On the World Health Organisation index the west African country occupies 186th position out of 192 member countries for the state of its health infrastructures. At independence in 1960, poverty affected only about 15 percent of the Nigerian population, according to official figures. By 1980, it has grown to 28 percent and further rose to 46 percent in 1985 and 66 percent in 1996 when the population was some 110 million people. The poverty level in 2003 was about 80 percent of theernment officials admitted that only 13 died. To stem the fighting, government sent troops to the region on September 4 to disloge the militant gangs causing troubles and stealing crude oil from pipelines to fund their armed struggle.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[EU report welcomes Turkish reforms, laments gaps.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Turkey has made significant reforms to prepare to one day join the European Union, but in many key areas they still fall short, according to an EU report revealed Friday ahead of its publication next week. The findings emerged as two new clouds appeared on the horizon for Turkey, as it crosses its fingers for a positive report from the European Commission on its bid to start EU membership talks. The EU report, first published by France's Le Monde newspaper and seen by AFP in Brussels, listed a series of areas where Turkey has shown "a substantial institutional convergence. towards European standards." These include the abolition of the death penalty, a crackdown on torture, a reduction in the role the powerful military in society and increased tolerance for the Kurdish population, it said. "Following decades of sporadic progress and partly because of a political consolidation after the 2002 elections, there has been a substantial institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards," it said. But the Commission report revealed Friday also highlights shortcomings in Turkey's EU preparations. "Although torture is no longer systematic, numerous cases of torture and in particular ill-treatment still continue to occur and further efforts will be required to eradicate such practice," the report said. Complaints of torture outside of official detentiony and Tuesdayu. Meanwhile French President Jacques Chirac said he favours changing France's constitution in order to require a national referendum on Turkey's EU bid. A clear majority of French people are opposed, according to recent polls. Turkey has been seeking EU membership since 1963 but the bid has been controversial, with many existing EU member states questioning whether the largely Muslim nation of some 70 million could fit easily into the bloc. The Commission, the EU's executive arm, is widely expected to recommend in its report to be published on October 6 that the EU start membership negotiations with Turkey. The leaked report does not include those all-important recommendations, which will form the basis for a final decision to be made by EU leaders at a mid-December summit on whether to give the green light for talks with Ankara. Turkey's EU hopes wobbled last week over plans to criminalize adultery, but were brought back on track when the Turkish parliament Sunday passed a reformed penal code demanded by the EU if it is to win a green light from Brussels. EU enlargement commissioner said after those reforms were agreed that there were "no more obstacles on the table" to Turkey's EU hopes. Separately, an "impact study" to be published alongside next Wednesday's report says that Turkey's EU entry should be good news if well managed, although Ankara may have to wait until "well into the next decade" to join. "Accession of Turkey to the Union would be challenging both for the EU and Turkey. If well managed, it would offer important opportunities for both," said the study, leaked on Thursday. "The necessary preparations for accession will last well into the next decade. The EU will evolve over this period and Turkey should change even more radically," it said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Italian sports doctor Michele Ferrari, who has worked with several top cyclists including six-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence for malpractice by a court here, legal sources said on Friday. However Ferrari, the former doctor of several cycling teams - most notably Gewiss in the mid 1990s - was acquitted of distributing doping products which could endanger health. Later in the day, Armstrong said in a statement that he and the US Postal team had suspended links with Ferrari while they waited for court proceedings to run their course. Just 10 days ago, Italian prosecutor Lorenzo Gestri had recommended a 14-month prison sentence for Ferrari for administering performance-enhancing substances to cyclists. On leaving the court, Ferrari, who used to work under notorious Italian sports doctor Francesco Conconi, said: "I certainly did not expect this sentence because I am innocent of this whole affair." Ferrari's lawyer Dario Bolognesi said they would appeal, and emphasised that his client had been acquitted of the most serious charge of distributing doping products. "We will appeal. The most serious accusation has gone and the whole trial is linked to the interpretation of standards in doping and sporting fraud, and to the comments of rider Filippo Simeoni," Bolognesi said. Armstrong said in a statement: "I was disappointed to learn of the Italian court's judgment against Dr. Michele Ferrari. "Dr. Ferrari has been a longtime friend and trusted adviser to me and the USPS team, during which time he never suggested, prescribed or provided me with any performance-enhancing drugs. "I was pleased to hear that Dr. Ferrari was acquitted of the charge of providing illegal drugs to athletes. I am not surprised by that verdict. "However, I have always said that I have zero tolerance for anyone convicted of using or facilitating the use of performance-enhancing drugs. "As a result of today's developments, the USPS team and I have suspended our professional affiliation with Dr. Ferrari as we await the release of the full verdict, which will contain Judge Maurizio Passerini's reasoning. "In the meantime, I personally wish the very best for Dr. Ferrari and his family during this difficult time." Italian rider Simeoni, one of Ferrari's main accusers and currently in Verona for the world road race championships, said the court's judgement had vindicated his decision to speak out. "From a human point of view, I regret Ferrari's sentence but it shows my statements were justified and that there is justice in this world. You just have to be patient," said the Domina Vacanze rider. "Everyone knew what was going on but no one said anything. But I spoke out and I am happy that my comments finally bore fruit, espe After Ferrari later revealed the secret of his team's success he was sacked, but he continued having contact with several top athletes over the years, including history-making Armstrong.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Days before the European Union publishes a report about the progress of reforms in Turkey, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denied that torture takes place in his country. Turkey did not carry out torture and human rights groups who claimed otherwise were "blinded by ideology", Erdogan told the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel in an advance extract of its Saturday edition. The EU report, which is due to be published next Wednesday but has been seen by France's Le Monde newspaper and AFP, is crucial to Turkey's hopes of joining the European Union. It says "although torture is no longer systematic, numerous cases of torture and in particular ill-treatment still continue to occur and further efforts will be required to eradicate such practice". Although the German newspaper had not seen the EU report before it interviewed Erdogan, he was asked about reports from human rights groups that torture still took place in Turkey. "There is no torture in my country," Erdogan said. "In all these reports about torture, what is missing is proof. There is no systematic torture. That is also what the (EU) investigations showed, which Commissioner (Guenter) Verheugen ordered after his visit to the PKK area." The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), now known as KONGRA-GEL, has been fighting rule from Ankara for 20 years. Asked if reform would continue even if the EU decided against inviting Turkey to membership talks, Erdogan told the paper: "I don't even want to think about that possibility. That would be a tough blow for me personally and for my people." Erdogan will receive a prestigious prize in Berlin on Sunday for showing courage and vision in the reform process.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Belarussian Kanstantsin Siutsou staked his claim for a place in the professional peloton when he stylishly won the men's under-23 road race crown at the world cycling championships here on Friday. Siutsou, 22, rode alone over the line of the 177km race, held over 12 laps of a 14.75km circuit around Verona, in a time of 4hr 33min 33sec. Dutchman Thomas Dekker, of the Rabobank team, came second to take the silver medal ahead of Mads But despite efforts by Dekker and numerous other riders to close the gap, there was a lack of cohesion in the chase. The chasers were disadvantaged by the presence of the two Italians who were doing little to help close the gap. With two laps to go their deficit on the front two riders stood at just over a minute and had hardly reduced by the time the bell sounded to signal the start of the last lap. However hopes of an Italian gold medal faded when Siutsou attacked Pozzovivo on the way up the three-kilometre long Torricelle climb. Pozzovivo had trouble giving chase, and by the time he had got his legs back Dekker and Christensen had overtaken him. The little Italian engineering student managed to keep up, but he had nothing left in the final straight when the Dutchman overtook the Dane yards before the finish line.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISTANBUL, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Beleaguered Spanish coach Vincente Del Bosque won a respite at struggling Turkish giants Besiktas Friday after the team advanced to the next stage in the UEFA Cup. Del Bosque's future at Besiktas has been in doubt since last weekend when the Istanbul outfit lost 3-2 to underdogs Ankaraspor, in their latest humiliation since the beginning of the domestic league. Besiktas fans, who were last week calling for Del Bosque's resignation, shouted chants in favor of the Spaniard after their team beat Norway's Bodo Glimt 1-0 in Istanbul Thursday to qualify for the group stage of the UEFA Cup. "We expect the same results in the (domestic) league," the club's deputy president Kivanc Oktay told Anatolia news agency Friday, pointing at a match with league co-leaders Trabzonspor on Sunday. "A victory in this game will have very different rammifications." Oktay insisted that the management had made no decision to sack Del Bosque, although several coaches, including Frenchman Raynald Denoueix, had confirmed they had been approached to replace the former Real Madrid trainer. "We never said that we are sacking our trainer. We stand by him. We are not supposed to review this decision after each and every match," Oktay told Anatolia. "Del Bosque is a coach who has proven himself. We may have been unsuccessful so far, but I believe we will win the victories we expect from now on," he said. Besiktas managers had signalled that the outcome of the Bodo Glimt game would decide the Spaniard's fate. Del Bosque thanked Besiktas fans for their support after the match. "I am working not for the sake of my post, but for the team," he said. "Some people think that my mind is still with Real Madrid, but this is not true. I am working for Besiktas' success." Del Bosque, who was sacked from Real Madrid last year despite winning two Spanish and two European titles in three years, has been in trouble since the start of the Turkish season, with his side so far failing to win a single game. Besiktas are currently 13th in the 18-team league.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair's operation Friday for an irregular heartbeat has gone "very successfully" and he should be home in the evening, his finance minister Gordon Brown told BBC television. "I know that he's now out of his operation and it's gone very successfully and I know too he's able to return to Downing Street this evening," the chancellor of the exchequer said. "I think today our thoughts are with Mr Blair, and his family, for the recovery that I think everybody hopes he will have from this operation," added Brown, who was interviewed in Washington. Blair, 51, announced in TV interviews Thursday that he would undergo a routine heart procedure Friday. He also said he planned to serve "a full third term" if his Labour party wins re-election. Brown, the prime minister's main rival within Labour, was in the US capital for meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Earlier Friday, Sky News television, quoting unofficial statements said Blair's operated had been completed and that he was "doing well".

		<d><![CDATA[ABUJA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said Friday that his government will not tolerate "undue militancy" in the oil-rich Niger Delta or action that would compromise the majority interest, in a speech marking 44 years of independence from Britain. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," he said in a broadcast on television and radio. "Government will not tolerate in any way or form any act that would mortgage or compromise the interest of the majority." He confirmed that government officials were meeting with the head of the Niger Delta rebels who threatened early this week to go to war if their demands for a bigger slice of Nigeria's oil wealth, greater autonomy for their Ijaw people, and a national debate on Nigeria's problems are not met. "We are talking to those I describe as rascally elements from the Niger Delta in an effort to open lines of dialogue and peace, as they feel aggrieved by their state authorities," he said of the group led by Mujahid Dokubo Asari. Asari began talks Wednesday with officials in Obasanjo's government ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to quit the Niger Delta. A statement issued Monday by Asari advised oil majors to leave the delta region, which pumps the bulk of Nigeria's daily output of 2.3 million barrels, and warned that his Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF) would declare "all-out war" against the government if the demands were not met. "The obvious assessment so far is that not much impact has been made on the lives and living standards of most ordinary people of the Niger Delta," Obasanjo said in his speech. He urged regional officials "to endeavour to be seen to be more alive to their responsibilities and the plight of the people they are elected to govern." Obasanjo also warned delta residents that acts of vandalism only serve to damage Nigeria's image and undermine economic growth. "I want to appeal to all Nigerians that rascality and vandalism, which are rapidly becoming the hallmark of the Niger Delta, have implications for the production, distribution and pricing of crude oil, for our global economic rating, for investor confidence in our economy," he said. Crude oil exports account for 95 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income and about 65 percent of budgetary revenues. The west African country is Africa's largest and OPEC's sixth biggest oil exporter. Unrest on Tuesday forced oil futures prices through the 50 dollar per barrel barrier. Oil prices eased slightly Friday, with traders heartened by Obasanjo's tough talk against the rebels and his assurance that a "rapprocheory", he said. On a recent fuel price hike, he said there has been "some unease about the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil industry". The nation's four refineries produce only one-third of the country's fuel needs, making it necessary for oil-rich Nigeria to import refined petroleum products. The judiciary last week lifted a cap on fuel prices, and retail prices for petrol, diesel and kerosene climbed around 25 percent. That sparked outrage and threats of a national strike. Many Nigerians live on less than one dollar a day.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Some 100,000 leaflets from the family of British hostage Ken Bigley were handed out at Sunni mosques across Baghdad on Friday, the Muslim day of rest, appealing for his release, the British embassy said. A personal message from the 62-year-old's mother, brothers, wife and son was coupled with various comments from Muslim leaders and groups denouncing kidnapping and the execution of hostages. "We appeal to Ken's captors to hear the plea of their Muslim brothers," the family said in the leaflet, which was translated into Arabic and distributed to 26 mosques in the Iraqi capital. "We appeal to Ken's captors to return Ken home to us safely. We love him and we need him," they said, in the second such leafleting campaign since the engineer was seized on September 16 from his Baghdad home. Bigley was taken along with two US colleagues by the Unity and Holy War group of suspected Al-Qaeda operative Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, who have already beheaded the Americans. "Verily. Allah commands you to do justice and be kind," the leaflet said. "No soul can bear the burden of another's sin." Comments collected over the past few days from Muslim organisations and figures in Britain and across the region added weight to the appeal. "The practice of taking hostages, and still more of killing them, whether they are Muslim or non-Muslim and whatever their nationality, is rejected with all clarity and determination in our teaching," said the Al-Azhar Committee in Egypt, Sunni Islam's highest authority, said. Yasser al-Serri, of the London-based Islamic Observatory, called on the kidnappers to set Bigley free. "We appeal to them to act in accordance with the teachings of our religion," he said in the leaflet. The message followed an appeal from Bigley's Thai wife on Thursday begging his captors for mercy after she watched him on television shackled in a cage and imploring British Prime Minister Tony Blair to save his life. A spokeswoman at the British embassy said the leaflet drop mainly targeted Sunni mosques in the capital, including two in the Haifa Street district -- a stronghold of Sunni Arab insurgents.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Norway's reigning world champion Petter Solberg, driving a Subaru Impreza, took the overnight lead in the Rally of Italy, the 13th round of the 16-race world championship, here in Sardinia on Friday. Solberg, the 2003 Rally of Italy champion, won three of the days six special stages to take a 30.3sec advantage on Finland's Marcus Gronholm with overall championship leader Sebastien Loeb third at 34.8sec. Fresh from his win in Wales, Solberg won the opening two stages, and held his lead by winning the final stage of the day. Loeb, who was beaten by Solberg on the last day of the Rally of Great Britain two weeks ago, had a slow start finishing just ninth in the first special, but the Citroen driver was third fastest in the second special. The Frenchman, who can wrap up his first world title this weekend, won the third special and with Peugeot driver Gronholm taking the following two, Loeb was just 0.5sec behind Solberg in the final special of the day. "Not perfect, but not bad times," Solberg said. "On the second and third stages, the engine was running very warm, so it dropped to three cylinders and cut off the anti-lag from time to time." "It's going to be interesting to see what the stages are like when they're used for a second time."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ANKARA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A row with Brussels on the status of Turkish Cypriots forced Turkey on Friday to scrap talks it was to host between the European Union and Muslim nations, in another tense episode ahead of a crucial decision on the country's bid to join the EU. Officials in Ankara were quick to dismiss fears that the spat would have an adverse impact on a December 17 verdict by EU leaders on whether to start accession talks with Turkey. "The cancellation of the gathering has no bearing on the decision to be taken regarding Turkey -- there is no link whatsoever between the two issues," a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. The row came hot on the heels of a crisis between Turkey and the EU that was resolved last week when Ankara backed down on plans to criminalize adultery. On Wednesday, the European Commission is set to release a key report, widely expected to be a favorable, on Turkey's progress towards EU membership. The informal meeting between foreign ministers from the EU and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), set for Monday and Tuesday in Istanbul, collapsed after the EU's Dutch presidency called on fellow members to boycott the talks amid a dispute on how the Turkish Cypriots would take part. Ankara had insisted on calling the breakaway Turkish Cypriot enclave a "state" even though EU nations -- like the entire international community, save Turkey -- recognize the Greek Cypriot government of the divided island. The gathering was intended to promote better ties and understanding between Europe and Muslim countries. The first such talks between the two blocs were held in Istanbul in February 2002, in the wake of the September 11 attacks in the United States the previous year. "We regret the fact that an important initiative, aimed at contributing to world peace by promoting dialogue between civilizations and cultures, has been prevented due to such an unessential reason," the Turkish foreign ministry said. EU officials also had some harsh words for Ankara. "I'm surprised that Turkey is risking a new row with Europe in the middle of an important phase of its EU candidacy," a European diplomat told AFP. He described Turkey's attitude as "a remarkable example of amateurism ahead of the historical December 17 decision." At the heart of the row was a decision by the OIC in June to refer to the Turkish Cypriot community, which has an observer status in the pan-Islamic group, as "the Cypriot Turkish state," without formally recognizing it. The decision was a gesture to the Turkish Cypriots following the strong support they gave in an April referendum to a UN plan to end the 30-year division of Cyprus. The peace effort failed when the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot south of the island rejected the plan, ensuring that they alone joined the EU on May 1. The Greek Cypriots, backed by EU member Greece, are categorically opposed to any move that could imply recognition of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot statelet in the north, called the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). "The meeting (in Istanbul) was sabotaged because of provocations by the Greek Cypriots," a Turkish diplomat charged. Turkey had assured EU countries that their participation at the gathering alongside the Turkish Cypriots would not amount to recognition of the TRNC. Various formulae the two sides proposed to resolve the dispute were mutually rejected. Hostilities between Turkey and Greek Cyprus, some observers say, may impede Turkey's efforts to join the EU, where the Greek Cyprus is now a full member.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Wall Street shares forged higher Friday as sentiment got a boost from mostly upbeat economic news and lower oil prices, with a shakeup at PeopleSoft boosting expectations for a high-profile tech sector merger. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lifted 106.78 points (1.06 percent) to 10,187.05 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rallied 39.34 points (2.07 percent) to 1,936.18 at 1545 GMT. The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index advanced 15.58 points (1.40 percent) to 1,130.16. Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak said Wall Street opened on an upbeat note, lifted by overseas markets after a strong reading of the closely-followed Tankan business sentiment survey in Japan. There is also "optimism that now that we are actually going to get third quarter earnings as opposed to just pre-announcements, that maybe it won't be as bad as the pre-announcements implied," said Boockvar. Also helping, said the analyst, was a fresh dip in oil prices and JP Morgan's upgrade of semiconductor equipment makers, Novellus Systems and Teradyne. PeopleSoft was leading the tech sector after the board dumped chief executive Craig Conway, possibly clearing the way for a takeover by Oracle, and further consolidation. Analyst Art Hogan of Jefferies and Co. said it was too early to say for sure that the ouster of Conway clears the way for a merger with Oracle, but Wall Street appears to be seeing it that way. "The obvious interpretation is that this makes the deal more doable," Hogan said. Hogan expected to see strength in the software sector on anticipation of more merger activity. "If this deal happens, its starts the daisy chain of a whole lot more merger and acquisition activity," he said. On the economic front, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in slightly below expectations at 94.2 from 95.8 earlier in the month. But construction spending rose by a better-than-expected 0.8 percent in August. And the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, while falling to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 percent in August, still showed strong growth. "You can't have a strong manufacturing sector without decent underlying economic fundamentals," said Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors. "The demand may be coming more from businesses and foreign customers than consumers, but that doesn't matter." PeopleSoft shares rallied 1.62 or 8.16 percent to 21.47 as investors bet on a merger; Oracle climbed 55 cents or 4.88 percent to 11.83. Northwest Airlines added 29 cents to 8.50 after naming Douglas Steenland as chief executive officer to replace the departing Richard Anderson. Merck, which suffered a 27 percent meltdown after its global withdrawal of the blockbuster drug Vioxx a day earlier, staged a modest rebound, gaining 89 cents to 33.89. Boeing meanwhile climbed 24 cents to 51.86 after announced it had delivered 67 commercial planes for the third quarter and 218 for the first nine months of the year. Bonds fell on the movement into equities. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 4.187 percent from 4.119 percent Wednesday and that on the 30-year bond to 4.944 percent from 4.891 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Spain legalises gay marriages, sparks Church anger.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MADRID, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same-sex marriages -- but the move sparked fury within a still influential Roman Catholic Church. The plan, which will also give gay couples the right to adopt, "recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner but also to adopt a child," cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega said. Spain "is in the forefront of Europe and of the world in the struggle against centuries of discrimination," de la Vega said, adding that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants, or 10 percent were homosexual. To date, gay marriages are only legal in Europe in Belgium and the Netherlands -- though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt. Similar unions are legal in six Canadian provinces and the US state of Massachusetts. The plan, which is to come into force next year once it obtains parliamentary approval, has been fiercely opposed by Spain's Roman Catholic Church, whose influence remains high if declining. A statement issued by Church sources following the announcement decried the move and said "society cannot remain indifferent to this attack" on its traditional values. An association of Christian fringe groups and the archbishopric of Barcelona also pledged to campaign against the move. "It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life," Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference, insisted in midweek. But de la Vega rejected the criticism. "There are thousands of children already living in Spain with homosexual parents and more than 50 studies show there are no differences between children who grow up with homosexual parents and others. "Most Spanish people think what is important in adoption is the well-being of the child quite apart from the sexual orientation of the parents," she said. Recent opinion polls point to an electorate in step with the government with a July poll indicating 66.2 percent support for same-sex marriages, though the figure fell to 48.2 percent for adoptions by gay couples. Some 14 articles of the civil code will be altered so that the words "man and woman" and "father and mother" are replaced by "partners" or "parents". According to Justice Minister Juan Fernando Lopez de Aguilar, "this initiative has not been taken against anything or anyone." He told the news conference that the government "is cooperating with the (Roman Catholic) Church and considers that an open conflict with it is not good." "This law is part of the Socialist programme which has been voted for by the Spanish," said Beatriz Gimeno, president of the country's Gay, Lesbian and Transexuals Federation. "The Church has nothing to say about it. This interventionist tendency by the Church is the virus and must be eradicated." Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, whose crusade to liberalise social policy includes facilitating divorce, said earlier this week: "I deeply respect the opinions of the Catholic Church even if they are very critical of the government. I ask them to show the same respect." Spain's main opposition Popular Party plans to propose an alternative law allowing homosexuals to form a "civil union" that would give them the same rights as unmarried heterosexual couples, save for the right to adopt. Gay rights groups in Madrid said they would hold a celebration in the capital's 'gay quarter' Chueca to mark a "historic" day.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Italian driver Jarno Trulli, who has signed to drive for Toyota next season, will now be driving for the Japanese constructor in the final two races of this season, Toyota said on Friday. The Italian is one of only four drivers to have won a Grand Prix in 2004, having dominated the Monaco GP to take his maiden race victory for Renault. Trulli, who was dropped by Renault last month, will now race for Toyota at the Japanese Grand Prix on October 10, alongside France's Olivier Panis, and with Brazilian Ricardo Zonta in Brazil on October 24. "It will be nice for me to be back in Japan because I have a lot of Japanese supporters and I'm sure they will give me a huge welcome," said Trulli. "I am thankful to Olivier and Ricardo for making this possible. The Japanese Grand Prix weekend will help me put together a general impression of how things work at Toyota. Overall the experience will give me a head start with some input to the way I have to work over the winter." Panis, who will be the team's third driver next season when Ralf Schumacher joins to partner Trulli, said he understood the need to allow the Italian as much track time as possible. "I understand how important it is for the team to start working with Jarno as soon as possible," said the French veteran.

In consideration of the positive work achieved with Toyota over the last two years, I am willing to give my team mate Ricardo this opportunity.

		<c><![CDATA[A Zimbabwe court on Friday ordered the release without charge of 46 women who were arrested earlier this week for staging a protest march between the second city of Bulawayo and Harare, a lawyer said. But seven others, including prominent activist Jenni Williams, who were arrested on Wednesday in Harare had yet to make a court appearance. "They have been released. The magistrate ruled that there was no basis for them to answer those charges," lawyer Chipo Hama said by phone from Chegutu, the small town where the women were arrested on Tuesday. The women staged a march of more than 400 kilometres (250 miles) to protest a proposed law on banning foreign human rights group and cutting off funding to groups promoting rights and democracy. Police arrested the 46 women on Tuesday in Chegutu, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of the capital, for violating the tough security laws, notably "disturbing the peace, security or order of the public". Their colleagues, who pressed on to the capital, were arrested on arrival. Police said the protesters had failed to obtain permission for the protest march as required under the country's security laws.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[CAIRO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Egypt needs to invest 20 billion pounds (five billion dollars) a year more to achieve the government's target growth rate of six percent, Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif was reported as saying Friday. The premier told government newspaper Al-Ahram that his country needed to invest a total of 100 billion pounds (16.2 billion dollars) a year to achieve the growth target. "Current annual investments amount to 70 billion pounds (11.3 billion dollars)", Nazif said, adding "this figure is not enough to attain the required growth rate." Planning Minister Osman Mohammed Osman said Monday the government projected actual growth of 5.5 percent for the fiscal year 2004/2005, which began July 1, compared to a growth rate of 4.1 in 2003/2004. Nazif said that "direct subsidies" on basic commodities cost state coffers 12.5 billion pounds (two billion dollars) each year, including eight billion just for bread. Nazif insisted the government had no desire to remove bread subsidies, but was studying the possibility of lifting subsidies on other commodities and offering financial compensation to around 10 million holders of commodity supply cards. He noted that "a national consensus was necessary in order to implement this idea" due to the importance of the issues involved. A previous attempt to lift bread subsidies led to riots across the country in 1977 that threatened to undermine the government itself. Officials charge that many cardholders resell the commodities they buy at subsidized prices for a profit.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[China vows to move toward flexible exchange rate ahead of G7 meeting.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[China pledged to move toward a flexible exchange rate, the US Treasury Department said Friday, hours ahead of a key meeting of the world's top finance chiefs who are expected to press Beijing to ease its currency policies. A Treasury statement said the commitment came during a meeting here Thursday of Chinese and US officials preparing for a gathering later Friday of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank presidents. The Chinese delegation, led by Finance Minister Jin Renqing, "reaffirmed China's commitment to further advance reform and to push ahead firmly and steadily to a market-based flexible exchange rate, and described the steps the Chinese government has taken to create conditions to establish a more flexible exchange rate," the statement said. It also noted that the US delegation "expressed support for continued efforts by the Chinese government to bring about this goal as rapidly as possible." Renqing and the head of the Chinese central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, are to join counterparts at a dinner following a meeting of the Group of Seven countries, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. It will be the first appearance at a G7 gathering of senior Chinese officials and is seen as belated recognition by the major industrialized powers of China's stature in the world economy. The United States and its G7 partners have made no secret of their displeasure with the Chinese currency's dollar peg, which they say artificially weakens the cost of Chinese exports -- making them more competitive -- while increasing the cost of imported goods in China. A newly formed US labor, industry and farm alliance, the China Currency Coalition, maintains that Chinese imports in the United States are undervalued by 40 percent and US exports to China overvalued by the same figure. US Treasury Secretary John Snow earlier this week said bluntly that he and his G7 colleagues would step up the pressure on China to let its currency float freely. Whether or not the Chinese statement of intent Thursday will be sufficient to satisfy the G7 has yet to be determined. Prior to the US Treasury Department statement, analysts at Commerzbank predicted in a research note that the United States would indeed announce that China was moving toward flexibility. They said the "the notion that China is moving in the desired direction and willing to be seen on the same page" could lead to some weakening in the US dollar "before reality sets in (that) there is no actual change from where we are now." Western officials and analysts also contend that China's present currency stance contributes to imbalances in global economic momentum. A more flexible exchange rate, according to this argument, would for example boost US exports to China and thereby help reduce "China needs that. So does a China-centric Asia. And so does the rest of an increasingly integrated, yet woefully unbalanced, global economy."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Spanish government Friday approved plans for homosexual marriage, including the right of gay couples to adopt, making the the country the most liberal in Europe, with Belgium and the Netherlands, in the field of gay rights. A country-by-country review of current legislation: - BELGIUM: Marriage between homosexuals became legal on June 1, 2003: since February it also covers foreigners. For the union to be valid one of the partners needs to be Belgian or to live in Belgium. Gay couples have the same rights as heterosexual couples, in particular insofar as inheritance and succession rights are concerned, but do not have the right to adopt. - NETHERLANDS: The Dutch Senate adopted in December 2000 legislation authorising civil homosexual marriage and the adoption by two same-sex parents of children provided the children have Dutch nationality. - NORTHERN EUROPE: Denmark was the first country in the world to authorise (on October 1, 1989) a "registered partnership" between gays. Homosexual couples have the same rights as heterosexual partners, except in the areas of insemination and adoption. Norway (1993), Sweden (1994), Iceland (1996) and Finland (2001) followed suit. In all these countries the law gives gay couples the same legal and social rights as married heterosexual couples. Sweden is the only one to authorise adoption (since February 2003). In January Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen backed a religious ceremony for gay couples. - FRANCE: In October 1999 the Civil Pact of Solidarity (PACS) giving legal status to non-married couples, in UNITED NATIONS, Oct 1 (AFP) - Lebanon and Syria have not met the demands in last month's UN Security Council resolution calling for the respect of Lebanese sovereignty, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a new report on Friday.

		<c><![CDATA[Pakistan Friday said it would continue to cooperate with the United Nations global nuclear watchdog but that it would not allow it to interview the disgraced architect of the country's nuclear programme. "Pakistan had extended cooperation to the IAEA and would continue to do so. However, access to a Pakistani scientist was not possible," a spokesman for Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement. Pakistan, which is not a signatory to the global nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), would still cooperate with international efforts against the nuclear blackmarket, he said. "Pakistan has full confidence in its own investigative system," the official added. Pakistan has refused to let the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) interview disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, ringleader of a smuggling network, agency chief Mohamed ElBaradei told the BBC Thursday. ElBaradei said Khan's network had "more than 30 companies and 30 countries all over the globe involved in this fantastic sophisticated illicit trafficking." Pakistan was rocked earlier this year when Khan publicly confessed to leaking nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea. Khan was given a conditional pardon by President Pervez Musharraf, who insisted the proliferation was carried out by a handful of scientists without government involvement. Pakistan's federal parliament last month approved legislation tightening export controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[EU report welcomes Turkish reforms, laments gaps.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Turkey has made significant reforms to prepare to one day join the European Union, but in many key areas they still fall short, according to an EU report revealed Friday ahead of its publication next week. The findings emerged as two new clouds appeared on the horizon for Turkey, as it crosses its fingers for a positive report from the European Commission on its bid to start EU membership talks. The EU report, first published by France's Le Monde newspaper and seen by AFP in Brussels, listed a series of areas where Turkey has shown "a substantial institutional convergence. towards European standards." These include the abolition of the death penalty, a crackdown on torture, a reduction in the role the powerful military in society and increased tolerance for the Kurdish population, it said. "Following decades of sporadic progress and partly because of a political consolidation after the 2002 elections, there has been a substantial institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards," it said. But the Commission report revealed Friday also highlights shortcomings in Turkey's EU preparations. "Although torture is no longer systematic, numerous cases of torture and in particular ill-treatment still continue to occur and further efforts will be required to eradicate such practice," the report said. Complaints of torture outside of official detention centres considerably increased in the first half of 2003, it said. But Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel in an advance extract of its Saturday edition that his country did not carry out torture and human rights groups who claimed otherwise were "blinded by ideology". Although the German newspaper had not seen the EU report before it interviewed Erdogan, he was asked about reports from human rights groups that torture still took place in Turkey. "There is no torture in my country," Erdogan said. "In all these reports about torture, what is missing is proof." Another two other clouds loomed Friday: firstly the EU confirmed it is boycotting a meeting in Istanbul next weekend because Turkey is insisting on calling the breakaway Turkish Cypriot enclave a "state" at the gathering. Turkey has been forced to cancel the talks between the EU and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Officials in Ankara were quick to dismiss fears that the spat would have an adverse impact on a December 17 verdict by EU leaders on whether to start accession talks with Turkey. "The cancellation of the gathering has no bearing on the decision to be taken regarding Turkey -- there is no link whatsoever between the two issues," a senior Turkish government official said on conded by the EU if it is to win a green light from Brussels. EU enlargement commissioner said after those reforms were agreed that there were "no more obstacles on the table" to Turkey's EU hopes. Separately, an "impact study" to be published alongside next Wednesday's report says that Turkey's EU entry should be good news if well managed, although Ankara may have to wait until "well into the next decade" to join. "Accession of Turkey to the Union would be challenging both for the EU and Turkey. If well managed, it would offer important opportunities for both," said the study, leaked on Thursday. "The necessary preparations for accession will last well into the next decade. The EU will evolve over this period and Turkey should change even more radically," it said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Darleen Druyun, a former Air Force official charged in a deal that allowed her to get a job with Boeing after overseeing a controversial deal on tanker planes, was sentenced Friday to nine months in prison, officials said. Druyun had pleaded guilty earlier this year to a criminal conspiracy charge for her role in the deal that gave her a lucrative job with the aerospace company after she pressed for a lease agreement on refueling aircraft. A spokeswoman for the US Attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia said Druyun's sentence also calls for seven months' community confinement after her release from prison, three years' probation, 150 hours of community service and a 5,000-dollar fine. Druyun, who was the principal deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition and management, helped negotiate the 2002 deal with the Boeing Company to lease 100 Boeing 767 tanker aircraft for the Air Force for more than 20 billion dollars. She accepted a job with Boeing in January 2003 as vice president and deputy general manager of missile defense systems. Prosecutors said Druyun's daughter, herself a Boeing employee, contacted a senior executive of Boeing in September 2002, setting in motion a process in which Druyun worked out a deal to retire from the Air Force and accept the senior position at Boeing. The scandal forced a high-level shakeup at Boeing and prompted fresh reviews of the lease plan, which some lawmakers criticized as a sweetheart deal for Boeing. Championed by the Air Force as a way to begin replacing its aging KC-135 fleet more quickly, the contract was fiercely opposed by Senator John McCain and others, who said it would be more economical to purchase aircraft. In May, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put the plan on hold until further studies are completed in November. A Pentagon advisory board recently concluded there is no compelling material or financial reason to replace the Air Force's refueling jets. Some critics of the deal said the program should be reopened to allow Europe's Airbus, which lost out for the contract, to submit another bid.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said Friday that the UN court in The Hague had transferred a case to a domestic court in Serbia for the first time. De Ponte announced the move to reporters after what she described as a "very fruitful" meeting with Vladimir Vukcevic, the chief prosecutor of Serbia's special court for war crimes and organised crime. "I must confirm that we had very fruitful conversations and he received a very important case because we are in the completion strategy. I have decided that a case would be transferred to Belgrade," she said. She gave no details on which of the war crimes suspects indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) based at The Hague would be tried in the Serbian court. "We have many other cases to transfer in the near future. I am impressed with the structures here at the tribunal and I am sure they will be able to do it -- I am sure they will be able to conduct a trial," she said. Del Ponte arrived in Belgrade earlier Friday to attend a conference on war crimes and was booed by a small group of supporters of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, the top war crimes suspect on trial at The Hague. She is due to return to Belgrade on Monday for meetings with Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica amid mounting international pressure for Serbia to hand over one of the top suspects still at large, former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. Some 20 indictees, including four Serbian generals, are still at large in Serbia but Kostunica has said national stability is more important than their arrest and transfer to The Hague. "I have no problem with the judicial authorities and I would be happy if I had no problems when I meet political authorities on Monday," Del Ponte said. Mladic and Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic were charged in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Bosnia's 1992-95 war, notably the massacre of some 7,000 Muslims in the eastern town of Srebrenica. The four Serbian generals were indicted last year for their roles in the 1998-99 Kosovo conflict between Belgrade forces and separatist ethnic Albanians. A Serbian court issued warrants for their arrests only this week but so far they remain comfortably at large. Del Ponte insisted the generals must be tried at The Hague. A spokesman for the Serbian war crimes court, Bruno Vekaric, said no other former Yugoslav republic had been permitted to try a war crimes suspect indicted by the ICTY. "This is the first case in the whole of ex-Yugoslavia that The Hague tribunal is transferring to a local jurisdiction," he said. Del Ponte said before her talks with Vukcevic that Serbian courts had to prove they were ready to handle complicated and politically sensde "numbers or timetables" for any future withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a new report on Friday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GENEVA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The UN refugee chief Ruud Lubbers on Friday called on European Union interior ministers meeting in the Netherlands to reaffirm their commitment to protecting refugees "both within the EU and beyond". Speaking by video link from his office in Geneva, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Lubbers told the ministers that asylum seekers who reached Europe should have their claims heard in Europe, the UNHCR said in a statement. However, tacitly referring to the mass arrival of boatloads of asylum seekers in Italy, the UNHCR added: "There have to be credible alternatives to a dangerous sea crossing and information about these alternatives needs to be available". Germany and Italy recently outlined their proposal to set up asylum camps on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in North Africa. Britain made similar proposals last year for camps overseas, hinting that some asylum seekers who had already reached Europe could be transferred there until their claims were processed. But other countries, led by the Scandinavians, raised objections on human rights grounds. The issue was expected to come up in the EU meeting in the Dutch resort of Scheveningen. In a document sent to the EU outlining its recommendations for asylum and refugee protection, the UNHCR did not expressly rule out "transit zones", provided they do not harm opportunities or protection for asylum seekers. The document recommended that "greater emphasis" should be placed on ensuring that people seeking international protection in the European Union "are able to acorth Africa and the Middle East, UNHCR said.]]></c>

"The requirements on the various parties set out in resolution 1559 have not been met," said the report, obtained by AFP.

		<d><![CDATA[SIALKOT, Pakistan, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A suspected suicide bomb blast ripped through a Shiite Muslim mosque during Friday prayers in the eastern Pakistani city of Sialkot, killing at least 30 people and leaving dozens injured, police said. Hundreds of worshippers were packed into the Mistri Abdullah Imambargah mosque in the city center when the huge explosion tore through the building, police spokesman Mohammad Ihsanullah told AFP. "Thirty people have died so far and toll may rise as some of the injured are in critical condition," police officer Syed Ishtiaq Hussain Shah told AFP near the site of blast. Body parts and blood were seen splattered across the interior of the mosque. The explosion left a large crater and caused extensive damage to the building. "We believe the bomber carried the explosive into the mosque in a briefcase which he detonated while sitting amongst the worshippers and also blew himself up," an intelligence official, who would not be identified, told AFP. "It is an act of terrorism. ," police chief Nisar Ahmed told AFP. "We believe a suicide bomber carried out the dastardly attack at a time when hundreds of worshippers were present inside the mosque for Friday's prayers." One of the wounded, Hamid Naqvi, said he and other worshippers had been listening to a sermon when "suddenly there was a big bang." "There was panic and there was blood and screams all around," he said. Naqvi, who was hit by shrapnel, was speaking from the city's Allama Iqbal hospital where doctors said at least 34 wounded people had been taken. "Some of the bodies have serious burn wounds," doctor Mohammad Ali told AFP. Several hundred angry protesters poured onto the streets outside the mosque after the blast and clashed with police, the police chief said. Private television channels reported that the army was called in to quell the unrest. People were shown crying and beating their chests. Some clashed with police and several police vehicles were burnt. Paramilitary rangers surrounded the mosque and allowed only reporters and photographers inside as a crowd gathered outside. A witness said police later found and defused another bomb, weighing about seven kilograms (15 pounds), outside the mosque. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz condemned the attack. The incident "clearly shows that terrorists have no religion and are enemies of mankind", a state-run Associated Press of Pakistan report quoted Musharraf as saying in a statement. Aziz said killing people at a place of worship was a "highly condemnable" act." "Islam is a religion of peace and abhors terrorism," he said. The attack came five days after Pakistani security forces killed the country's most wanted Sunni Muslim extremist, Al-Qaenned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was blamed for two bomb attacks on Shiite mosques in the southern port of Karachi in May and June which left 45 people dead. The latest bombing also comes as the Pakistani security forces are locked in a fierce battle against Al-Qaeda which has seen a number of important arrests since July. The most notable were Pakistani computer expert Naeem Noor Khan and Tanzanian Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, who has been indicted by a US court for his role in the twin bombing of American embassies in East Africa in 1998.]]></c>

"The governments of both Lebanon and Syria have told me that the Syrian forces present in Lebanon. are there at the invitation of Lebanon and that their presence is therefore by mutual agreement," the report said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NIAMEY, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An "elite force" of 150 Niger soldiers has been trained by the United States military as part of an anti-terrorism campaign that aims to quell cross-border banditry in west Africa, the US embassy said Friday. The soldiers, who are commandoes, paratroopers or snipers, spent two months in desert combat training with US Marines near Samari, some 60 kilometers (35 miles) from the capital Niamey. Their training was envisioned under the US-funded Pan-Sahel initiative, which was launched in 2002 to bolster regional cooperation in tracking the movement of people and goods across the borders of Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad. Kitted out with US-supplied vehicles, logistical and communications equipment, the soldiers were learning how to detect "any eventual infiltration by al-Qaeda" or the Salafist Brigade for Combat and Call, an Islamic fundamentalist militia with purported links to the terror network of Osama bin Laden, a Niger military source told AFP. Clashes between the Salafists and the poorly outfitted Niger army have erupted with increasing frequency in the landlocked desert nation's north since early this year, as US assistance to Mali and Algeria in the battle against the Salafists have sent their insurgents fleeing into Niger and Chad. Sparsely populated and poorly patrolled, the Niger desert has in the last several years become a hotbed of nefarious activity including arms and drug trafficking as well as the smuggling of contraband such as stolen vehicles and cigarettes. Camel-mounted bandits sow havoc among the mostly rural population with an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of weapons and communication devices. Security ministers from several African nations including Niger met Thursday in Benin to agree a joint strategy to tackle cross-border crime and the scourge of arms trafficking in the region. The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, based in Togo, has estimated that about 10 million illegal firearms are circulating in west Africa and are enriching criminal networks.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Palestinian death toll mounts in Israeli incursion into Gaza Strip by Adel Zaanoun ATTENTION - UPDATES toll, ADDS quotes, background /// JABALIYA, Gaza Strip, Oct 1 (AFP) Seven Palestinians were killed in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip Friday, a day after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the army to step up a massive raid to stop militant rocket attacks on southern Israel. The latest campaign, codenamed "Days of Penitence", intensified after two Israeli toddlers were killed in Sderot, less than a kilometre (a mere half mile) across the Gaza Border. "The activity in Gaza has one clear overriding aim -- to prevent the firing of Qassam rockets at Sderot and the firing of mortar shells at Jewish settlements in Gaza," Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said while meeting troops about to be deployed in the northern Gaza Strip Friday afternoon. "This activity will take time -- it's not easy, it's complex," he warned. Forty-five Palestinians have been killed over the past three days along with two soldiers and a woman settler in one of the bloodiest battles since the Palestinian uprising started four years ago. Troops were preparing to take control of a six-kilometer (four-mile) deep buffer zone in the northern Gaza Strip to keep militants out of rocket range of southern Israel, a close aide to Sharon told AFP. The aide said the army could "be more aggressive" if militant rocket attacks continued. Two rockets did hit Sderot Friday, but without causing any casualties, the army said. The Islamic militant group Hamas generally claims most strikes on southern Israel but it was the Popular Resistance Committees -- a small faction mostly made up of former activists of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement -- which said it was behind Friday's attack. Thirty-five tanks were seen entering the town of Beit Hanun at dawn Friday, while another 30 were seen pushing into Beit Lahiya and 30 more spotted moving into the eastern sector of the Jabaliya refugee camp, residents said. Five of Friday's seven Palestinian victims died in two air raids on Jabaliya, sources on both sides said. Two were Hamas militants. An army spokeswoman said they were about to fire a Qassam rocket. Palestinian witnesses said an unmanned plane had fired on the Hamas men. Medics said at least 14 people had been wounded in the two air strikes and that a third one, also on Jabaliya, had wounded another person. Two more Palestinians were killed as they attempted to storm the Erez border crossing between the northern Gaza Strip and Israel. They were part of an eight-strong commando that was "armed and carrying a 30-kilogramme (66-pound) explosive charge," Israeli military sources said. The others were nabbed by the army. The botched attack was jointly claimed by Hamas and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a militant group affiliated to Fatah. The latest deaths brought the overall toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising to 4,400, includingons," UNRWA spokesman Matthias Burchard said in Geneva. "UNRWA strongly protests the totally unacceptable misuse of clearly marked UN installations and calls on the Israeli military to respect the neutrality of these places." Israel's security cabinet Thursday approved a broadening of the Gaza raid, which it said was open-ended but would not be "a permanent occupation". There have been mounting calls from ministers for a new "Defensive Shield-style" operation in the Gaza Strip, public radio said. Launched in March 2002, that operation saw the army reoccupy most of the West Bank in a bid to detain Palestinian militants and end a spate of suicide bombings.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Military officers from 15 west African countries and France on Friday completed preparations for a new round of training exercises in joint peacekeeping, due to start in Benin at the end of next month. A meeting in Benin's economic capital Cotonou has since Monday gathered dozens of officers from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), France and several other countries to prepare for the fourth training exercises of their kind. The two generals in charge of Recamp IV -- an acronym for Strengthening African Peace-Keeping Capabilities, France's commander of joint chiefs of staff Bruno Neveux and Benin's Fernand Amoussou, chief of general staff, on Friday formally signed the plan. "This is an exercise which shows the need and importance of a global approach to crisis management in Africa," General Neveux told AFP. The Recamp IV exercise will last from November 29 to December 10. Military officers from several countries in Europe, Asia and the United States also went to Cotonou for the preparations, the French military officer in charge of planning, Colonel Eric Guillemin, said earlier in the week. Previous joint exercises have been held, at France's initiative, in 1997, 2000 and 2003. The concept of cooperation between French and west African troops has been applied in a real conflict in Ivory Coast, a country divided since September 2002 by civil war. French and west African soldiers were deployed to patrol ceasefire lines in Ivory Coast between the south, which is in the hands of government forces, and the north, which is controlled by rebels. A peace pact signed in 2003 to end the war and bring rebels into the Ivorian government has not been fully implemented. The west African side of the peacekeeping operation has since passed into the hands of the United Nations. ECOWAS members are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A majority of Germans are against Turkey joining the European Union, according to a poll released Friday, days before a European Commission report is released on the state of Ankara's democratic reforms. A total of 57 percent of Germans oppose Turkish membership of the EU while 35 percent are against it, found the forsa institute poll for N24 television. Germany is home to more than two million Turks, making it the largest Turkish immigrant community in Europe. The German constitution contains no mechanism that would allow a referendum on Ankara's EU membership. The forsa group questioned 1,002 people on September 29. Its margin for error is three percent. The EU report, to be officially released on Wednesday but already seen by AFP, says that Turkey has made significant reforms to prepare to one day join the EU, but that it still falls short in many key areas.

A 700-kilometer (435-mile) stretch of the border with Afghanistan will be patrolled by Tajik border guards under Tajik officers, a high-ranking Tajik officer told AFP on condition of anonymity following talks between Tajik and Russian military experts. Under a 1993 agreement which lapsed last year, Russia sent troops and took over command of patrolling Tajikistan's 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Afghanistan, which is the world's top producer of opium, from which heroin is made. Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to begin a three-day visit to Tajikistan on Monday to discuss military cooperation and sign a new agreement on assistance patrolling the border, a favored route for smugglers to traffic heroin to western Europe. Russian soldiers currently total 3,000 out of the 11,000 patrolling the border, but are due to leave by the end of 2006. The United States has also offered Tajikistan assistance to improve its capability to patrol the border as Russian troops are withdrawn.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KILKENNY, Ireland, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[World number three Ernie Els went on a birdie blitz here on Friday to snatch the second round lead of the seven million dollar WGC American Express Championship. The 34-year-old shot a blistering eight-under 64 to take a two shot lead over first round leader Todd Hamilton, who still had five holes left to play. The South African, who had warned before the tournament that he was raring to go after a two week lay-off, opened with four straight birdies. Another at the ninth saw him go out in 31 - an impressive five-under. Els continued his birdie spree, collecting four more on the way home. He finished in perfect style on the 18th when he sank a 12 footer for par and keeping him at 11-under for the championship. "Got off to a perfect start. All of a sudden I had four birdies and I was off and running," said Els. "That was one of my better rounds of the year." Unlike on Thursday when conditions were ideal, the players were having to compete with driving rail squalls which were interrupted from time to time with a glimpse of the sun. The early morning starters saw none of the sun as rain poured down but despite the conditions Fred Couples shot a brilliant five-under 67 to move to four-under for the tournament. "It was cold, windy and wet. I didn't really want to be out there," said Couples. "I didn't expect to shoot that in this weather." Sergio Garcia, who began the day only one back of the lead, got the worst possible start when he dropped his tee shot on the par three third into the pond guarding the green. The Spaniard ran up a double bogey and was suddenly back to only three-under for the tournament. A birdie at 10 brought him back to four-under but Garcia had been hoping for something better after his first round five-under 67. Tiger Woods, still clearly suffering from the shoulder injury that dogged him on Thursday, continued to fight through the pain. The 28-year-old shot a second round two-under 70 to be only five back of Els. Ireland's Padraig Harrington gave the local fans who braved the elements something to smile about by carding a three-under 69. It left him only five behind Els with 36 holes still to play. American Brad Faxon was also at six-under for the tournament when he added a four-under 68 to his opening round of two-under 70. With the green softened by the rain, birdies were there to be had but American Chad Campbell, who started his second round at two-under par, found himself racing back down the leaderboard as he collected two double bogeys in his opening three holes. Another at the ninth and suddenly Campbell reached the turn seven-over for his round and four-over for the championship. Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee, struggling in the rain, went out in five-over 41 but a hole-in-one at the 169-yard 11th gave him something to finally smile about. It was his second hole-in-one in Europe this year. Earlier he had holed in one at the PGA Championship at Wentworth.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Rhetorical fireworks over Iraq but few solutions by Peter Mackler.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Central front in the anti-terror war or diversion, democratic success or cauldron of chaos: the US presidential candidates offered starkly different visions of Iraq but neither had any convincing exit strategy. Iraq dominated the 90-minute televised debate Thursday between President George W. Bush and his Democratic rival for the White House, Senator John Kerry. But if their exchanges were sharp, their solution to the deepening crisis stayed murky. Michael O'Hanlon, an analyst with the Brookings Institution, summed up the frustration of many Iraq watchers. "I'm afraid we are in such a difficult position that I don't have confidenraq, and the president insisted that "Iraq is a central part of the war on terror" which must be won to keep the United States safe. Holding himself up as the more steadfast of the two in times of adversity, Bush acknowledged that rebuilding Iraq "is tough, it's hard work, it's incredibly hard. And if we lose our will, we lose." He defended his decision to oust Saddam Hussein, even if his alleged weapons of mass destruction were never found nor ties to Al-Qaeda established. Bush pledged to stay the course, training Iraqi security forces and proceeding with elections still scheduled for January despite the worsening violence. "The Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom," he said. The Republican also ridiculed the notion that Kerry could persuade other countries to contribute troops to Iraq after dismissing it as peripheral to the war on terrorism. "So what's the message going to be. Please join us in Iraq for a grand diversion. Join us for a war tha't know how many American are prepared to sit down and listen to. 'Here's what the Kurd's think, here's what the Shiites think, here's what the Sunnis think. Here's what we got to worry about in Baghdad, Tikrit and Kirkuk," she said. But O'Hanlon said: "I think it's a better strategy to get the United States out as fast as is realistically possible because our presence is stoking the insurgency."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Thailand's Paradorn Srichaphan Friday lined up a semi-final clash with world number one Roger Federer as he handed out a 6-2, 7-5 defeat to Dutchman Dennis van Scheppingen at the 550,000-dollar Thailand Open. Paradorn, the world number 20, had a shaky conclusion to his quarterfinal, being broken while serving for victory. But the fourth seed buckled down, getting through two games later to earn his first career meeting against the world number one from Switzerland. "Nothing was easy, I had to work hard," said Paradorn, holder of five career trophies and standing 39-14 in 2004. "I felt more confident on court tonight. It was an exciting second set, I was glad to pull it out." Paradorn will have pride on the line against the Swiss. "I'll be giving 110 percent against him. The Thai people are very fair, but I know they want me to win. "I'm the number one in Thailand playing the number one in the world, this is the dream of every player. I'll be very relaxed because I have nothing to lose against him." Top seed Federer moved nearer to a 10th title of the season at the expense of Swede Robin Soderling with 7-6 (7/3), 6-4. "I had only one chance to get up an early lead, that was in the first game of the match and I didn't take it," said Federer, winner at three of the four Grand Slams this season. "He was playing really well, making me work quite hard. "It's always good to win in straight sets. This was my toughest match so far here, it was difficult all the way to the end." The Swiss struck 14 aces in the one-hour, 22-minute victory. American second seed Andy Roddick laid on a 21-ace performance to crush Thomas Johansson 6-3, 6-4, moving past jet-lag and into the semis. Roddick, 22, admitted that he appeared to have no chance at setting another serving speed record, after achieving the feat last weekend in the Davis Cup semi-final against Belarus. "I don't think it will happen here," said the American. "I played aggressive, I played the big points well and took my opportunities when they came up. "He didn't give me that many chances to get into his service games," he said of the effort from Johansson, the 2002 Australian Open champion. Roddick took just 51 minutes for his victory against the Swede, back after knee surgery which kept him away in 2003. Johansson scored only 10 aces and lost his serve twice. Roddick never faced a break point. The result improved Roddick to 69-13 this season. He now faces third seed Marat Safin, who knocked out Flavio Saretta 6-2, 6-1 leaving the top four seeds all in title contention.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices eased on Friday as Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that his government would not tolerate any "undue militancy" in the oil-rich Niger Delta. The price of light sweet crude for November delivery fell 22 cents to 49.45 dollars a barrel in late morning deals on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November lost 23 cents to 46.15 dollars in late trading. Oil prices hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in out-of-hours deals in New York on Tuesday and 46.80 dollars in London on Tuesday amid unrest in Nigeria. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," Obasanjo said in a televised speech to mark 44 years of Nigerian independence from Britain. Obasanjo said his government was continuing to hold talks with rebel leaders from the Niger Delta and assured that a "rapprochement" was taking place. "It is possible that the president's speech in Nigeria, being hopeful of a solution, eased some concerns" about supply disruptions, Investec analyst Bruce Evers said. "But it is an uneasy truce, a very fragile one. The situation can blow up again very quickly. Neither side trusts the other. If these rebels do not get what they want, there is going to be violence. "If the violence escalates, oil prices will go straight back above 50 dollars again," Evers cautioned. Rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari began talks with officials in Obasanjo's government on Wednesday ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to pull out of Niger Delta. Crude oil exports account for 95 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income and about 65 percent of budgetary revenues. "Nigerian oil is seen as crucial (by markets) because it is light, sweet oil, favoured by refineries and currently in short supply while there is a glut of sour crude," analysts at the Sucden brokerage firm said. Oil prices have endured a roller-coaster week, rising sharply at the start before falling Wednesday and creeping back up a day later. Prices fell mid-week as peace talks began in Nigeria and US crude oil inventories showed a surprise increase a week after tumbling to their lowest levels since February. The US Department of Energy said crude oil reserves rose 3.4 million barrels in the week to September 24 to 272.9 million barrels, a week after a spectacular drop of 9.1 million barrels due to Hurricane Ivan.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SCHEVENINGEN, The Netherlands, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[EU officials agreed on Friday to help fund a scheme by the UN's refugee agency to help five north African countries cope with a flow of refugees towards Europe, but remained divided over a contested proposal to set up transit camps for asylum seekers. The European Commission and the Netherlands proposed to fund the scheme to help Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya develop their asylum laws and train staff to process asylum requests in cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the commission said. The commission, the European Union's executive arm, will fund 80 percent and the Dutch 20 percent of the one million-euro (1.25-million-dollar) project, according to EU justice and home affairs commissioner Antonio Vitorino. The UNHCR, which already operates similar projects in several African and central European countries, stressed the scheme was distinct from a controversial proposal made by several European governments to set up camps in north Africa for people seeking asylum in Europe. Speaking after an informal meeting of EU interior and justice ministers here, Vitorino said the scheme could involve centres to house would-be immigrants intercepted in international waters in the Mediterranean. Without giving full details, he said the centres would not treat asylum demands for EU countries, although migrants would be offered the chance to apply for asylum in one of the five North African states concerned, he said. If they refused, they would be repatriated towards their country of origin, he said. Migrants stopped in EU territorial waters would continue to be dealt with within the EU countries. One of the conditions of the scheme is that participating countries have to sign the Geneva convention regulating the treatment of refugees -- which would oblige Libya to become a signatory of the convention. EU ministers remained divided however on an idea floated by Germany and Italy to set up an EU body outside the 25-member bloc to examine asylum applications, although none explicitly vetoed the idea. Britain had made a similar proposal last year, but other countries, led by the Scandinavians, have raised objections on human rights grounds. Vitorino said the commission was keeping an open mind but that a number of key conditions still had to be met before the EU could consider such a system. These included stronger cooperation with third party countries, clarity on how judicial reviews would be handled, plans for resettling failed asylum seekers and on sharing out successful applicants between EU states. From Geneva, meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Lubbers called on the EU ministers to reaffirm their commitment to protecting refugees "both within the EU and beyond". Speak that a mere 10 percent of people seeking asylum in the EU were granted refugee status, with the others classed as economic migrants. However he called for urgent efforts to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean, where hundreds of illegal immigrants risk their lives by trying to reach the European mainland by boat. "There is agreement that we should be proactive in dealing with the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean. to prevent (it) from turning into a graveyard," he said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices traded just below record highs Friday towards the end of a roller-coaster week that saw New York crude futures pierce the psychological 50-dollar level for the first time as unrest in Nigeria stoked supply worries. Crude oil prices smashed the 50-dollar barrier on Monday for the first time in the 21-year history of oil futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The surge came after a separatist movement in Nigeria threatened to wage war in the troubled Niger Delta region, warning oil majors and foreign nationals to leave by October 1. The delta pumps all of Nigeria's 2.3 million barrels per day of light, sweet low-sulphur crude which is most suitable for refining into petrol. Traders were already fretting over a host of supply worries, including low commercial oil inventories, unrest in Saudi Arabia, recent hurricanes, violence in Iraq and the financial woes of Russian energy giant Yukos. Oil prices eased slightly Friday after Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said his government was continuing to hold talks with rebel leaders from the Niger Delta and assured that a "rapprochement" was taking place. The price of li do little to ease supply strains since refineries are thirsty for light sweet crude, as produced by Nigeria, rather than Saudi Arabia's sour crude.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair was recovering Friday from surgery to correct an irregular heartbeat, a day after revealing that he intends to serve a full third term if re-elected. With his wife Cherie at his side, Blair checked into Hammersmith Hospital in west London for a relatively routine operation to restore his heart rhythm, requiring only local anesthetic and a couple of hours on the operating table. Several hours later, he was back at Downing Street, his official residence, smiling and looking relaxed. He was to rest for the weekend before embarking on an official visit to Ethiopia next week. "I'm absolutely fine, thanks," he said. "The hospital staff, the nurses, the doctors were brilliant." In a statement, Hammersmith Hospital said Blair was treated for "an irregular heartbeat due to atrial flutter (using) a planned procedure called radio frequency catheter ablation". "The procedure was successful in eliminating the atrial flutter. We consider the risk of recurrence of the problem to be very low," it said, adding that Blair should make a "rapid and complete recovery". Blair -- who was treated for the same problem a year ago -- himself announced the operation on Thursday, explaining: "It's not particularly alarming, but it's something that you should get fixed." One of Britain's leading cardiologists, Andrew Grace, said the delicate procedure which Blair underwent -- which involves two thin wires being inserted into the right atrium via a vein in the leg -- has a high success rate. "It is very safe, effective and well tolerated procedure to cure these sorts of issues," he told BBC radio. Blair also dropped a political bombshell Thursday by declaring that he intends to serve "a full third term", but no more, if his Labour Party wins the next general election. If the election comes next year, as many expect, that means Blair -- who led Labour to power in 1997 and 2001, and who has never been so unequivocal about his long-term plans -- could be prime minister until as late as 2010. "The decision as to who is the prime minister of the country is the decision of the British people. They're the boss," he told BBC television. "But if I am elected, I would serve a full third term," he said. "I do not want to serve a fourth term. I don't think the British people would want a prime minister to go on that long, but I think it's sensible to make plain my intention now." Blair's announcement Thursday was carefully timed. It came just hours after the close of Labour's annual conference, where Blair sought to heal lingering splits over the Iraq war, and immediately after polls closed in a parliamentary by-election in northeast England. Labour held on to the Hartlepool constituency, formerly held by Peter Mandelson, the new European Union trade commissioner, but only by a reduced margin over the Liberal Democrats. In making his long-term intentions so plain Thursday, Blair seemed to be making a fresh attempt at calming recurrent talk of a bitter feud with his finance minister Gordon Brown, his most likely successor, who has been waiting in the wings to take over Labour for a decade. He was also apparently seeking to defuse speculation about his own future before news leaked out Friday that he had bought himself a large private house in Connaught Square, an exclusive corner of west London. The Georgian terrace house, a stone's throw from Hyde Park and Edgware Road, the heart of London's Arab community, reportedly cost 3.6 million pounds (5.25 million euros, 6.51 million dollars).]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush charged Friday that Democratic White House hopeful John Kerry would let France decide when Washington could use force to defend itself. "The president's job is not to take an international poll. The president's job is to defend America," Bush said a day after his first debate with Kerry. Many US voters stites, even though he said he would not flinch from acting alone if needed. "No president, though all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America," said the Democratic senator from Massachusetts. "But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Oil prices soar beyond record 50 dollars, metals shine by Perrine Faye.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices broke above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time in volatile trading this week as unrest in major producer Nigeria fuelled concerns about supplies ahead of winter in the northern hemisphere. Metals hit fresh highs, boosted by heavy buying from speculators. The Commodities Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose to 283.22 points on Friday from 280.11 a week earlier. It spiked at 285.37 points on Thursday, the highest level for 23 years. GOLD: Gold prices rose to the highest level for more than five months helped by heavy buying from speculative funds as the dollar tumbled against the euro and oil prices rocketed to record summits. Gold climbed to 418.15 dollars an ounce at Friday's morning fixing, the highest level since mid-April. "Pressure on the dollar has seen gold edge over the 415-dollar level," said James Moore, analyst at TheBullionDesk.com specialist website. "Fund buying on the back of the (rising) euro has been the main culprit." Moore added: "The market seems generally happy to test higher with the combination of dollar weakness, geopolitical tensions and high oil prices all indicating a test to 425 dollars and potentially the year's high of 432 dollars." The euro reached 10-week high points against the dollar on Thursday, breaking beyond 1.24 dollars amid caution ahead of the weekend's Group of Seven meeting and as oil prices remained high. A weaker dollar makes gold, which is priced in the US currency on world markets, more attractive to buyers using other currencies. By Friday afternoon, gold prices stood at 418.10 dollars per ounce on the London Bullion Market against 407.85 a week earlier. SILVER: Silver prices mirrored the performance of gold, jumping to the highest level for more than five months. Silver prices broke through 6.90 dollars an ounce on Thursday for the first time since April 20. "Silver is busy rallying again as base metals are back up at levels seen in the first quarter of 2004," UBS analyst John Reade said. "Speculators have added to their already-long position in silver, but probably have the capacity to lift the white metal back above seven dollars per ounce, perhaps to 7.50 dollars if they are determined," he added. Silver prices rose to 6.840 dollars per ounce on Friday against 6.420 a week earlier. PLATINUM AND PALLADIUM: Platinum and palladium prices advanced strongly as strikes broke out in several mines across leading producer South Africa. Platinum prices climbed to 875 dollars an ounce on Tuesday, the highest point since mid-August, while palladium spiked to 224 dollars an ounce for the first time since July 22. South Africa's Anglo Platinum company, the world's leading producer of platinum, said Friday that two of its mines were hit by a miners' strike but insisted the work stoppage had not affected production. Workers at Anglo Platinum, which operates six mines in South Africa, joined about 17,000 fellow unionists who launched a strike on Wednesday at a separate mining group, Impala Platinum. But Anglo Platinum said the strike only affected two mines and that fewer than 10,000 of its 30,000 employees were taking part. "The uncertainty around the possibility of material interruptions to South African production has continued to drive the platinum market," Reade said. By Friday, platinum prices stood at 862 dollars per ounce on the London Platinum and Palladium Market, against 855 dollars a week earlier. Palladium prices traded at 222 dollars per ounce against 221 the previous week. BASE METALS: Base metals prices bounced higher, in particular aluminium which soared to the highest level for nine years on buying from speculative funds. Aluminium rose to as high as 1,849 dollars per tonne, while nickel climbed to 16,000 dollars per tonne -- the highest peak since Januar Energy said crude oil reserves rose by 3.4 million barrels in the week to September 24 to 272.9 million barrels, a week after a spectacular drop of 9.1 million barrels due to Hurricane Ivan. But inventories of distillates, including heating oil, are in short supply, analysts warned, sparking worries ahead of winter. "In the same way that gasoline shortages did earlier this year, tight winter heating fuel markets look likely to exert strong upward pressure on crude oil prices over the coming months," Barclays Capital analyst Kevin Norrish said. With markets uncertain of a peaceful outcome in Nigeria, prices threatened to climb above 50 dollars once more before falling on Friday as Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned that his government would not tolerate any "undue militancy" in the oil-rich Niger Delta. New York's light sweet crude for delivery in November climbed to 49.32 dollars per barrel on Friday against 48.35 a week earlier. In London, Brent Norf unfavourable weather in Ivory Coast on next year's crop began to recede. "Arguably, the bias is lower based on the weather concerns having run their course and traders having discounted prognostications that the Ghana and Ivory Coast crops might be smaller than last season's (2003/04) bumper levels," said Refco analyst Ann Prendergast. "Seasonally, cocoa prices have a tendency to fade at this time of year." On LIFFE, London's futures exchange, the price of cocoa for December delivery fell to 838 pounds per tonne from 858 a week earlier. On the CSCE, the New York futures market, the December contract dropped to 1,458 dollars per tonne from 1,493 the previous week. COFFEE: Coffee prices scaled new four-month summits in New York amid worries about the impact of the US hurricane season on stocks in Florida as well as a lack of rain in Brazil. But prices ended the week lower as traders locked in profits. Coffee futures hit 86.40 cents a pound in New York on Monday, the highest point since May 28. In London they rose to 710 dollars per tonne on Tuesday, the highest levels since mid-August, before paring gains. "Coffee futures are receding from their (Hurricane) Ivan-influenced highs at the start of the week," Refco's Prendergast noted on Friday. "Lack of rain in Brazil and concerns over smaller crop are fundamentally supportive," she added. On LIFFE, Robusta quality for November declined to 640 dollars per tonne on Friday from 675 a week earlier. On New York's CSCE market, Arabica for December delivery dipped to 79.95 cents per pound from 82.60. COTTON: Cotton futures started the week on a positive note but fell sharply on Thursday despite some positive fundamental factors, including a rise in US export sales. The US Department of Agriculture reported a jump of 57 percent in weekly cotton export sales to 219,500 bales in the week to September 23. New York's December contract stood at 46.50 cts per bushel from 533. October-dated soyabean meal -- used in animal feed -- retreated to 156.50 dollars per tonne from 158.50. Soyabean prices have fallen by 50 percent over the past six months to two-month lows. SUGAR: Sugar futures climbed on a flurry of speculative buying, notably in New York where prices reached a one-and-a-half-year high, against a background of strong demand and a production deficit. By Friday on LIFFE, the price of a tonne of white sugar for December delivery stood at 240 dollars from 238.80 a week earlier. On the CSCE in New York, a pound of unrefined sugar for March delivery rose to 8.91 cents from 8.63 the previous week. WOOL: Wool prices fell by 2.7 percent in number one producer Australia as an appreciation of the Australian dollar against its US counterpart deterred buying. Wool prices "struggled all week under pressure from further strengthening of the US exchange rate, the comparison with the better-styled fine wools selling in Newcastle last week and a lack of widespread demand," the Australian Wool Industries Secretariat said. "The buying pattern was very much dominated by purchases for China." The Australian Eastern index fell to 7.44 Australian dollars per kilo from 7.67 a week earlier. The British Wooltops index dropped to 402 pence from 418 a week earlier.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's top Tamil Tiger rebel group on Friday began a week-long meeting in Switzerland which is meant to prepare for the next round of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government, the Swiss foreign ministry said. Swiss officials met the chief negotiator of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Anton Balasingham and other rebel officials on the sidelines of the meeting of the LTTE's Consitutional Affairs Committee in Geneva, which is due to end on October 7. The Swiss foreign ministry said in a statement that it "welcomes the LTTE's continuing willingness to negotiate, and calls for peace talks to be resumed as soon as possible". The LTTE has blamed the government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga for the delay in reviving negotiations which the rebels themselves suspended in April last year. But Kumaratunga said last month that the Tigers were holding up talks aimed at ending a conflict that has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972. The Tamil Tigers were reportedly undertaking a three-week tour of Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland and Sri Lanka's peace broker Norway to persuade donors to use aid as a tool to pressure the government to resume peace talks based on rebel self-rule proposals. The Swiss foreign ministry said "a possible interim administration of the north east of Sri Lanka as decided in the peace talks should be based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka" and backed Norway's role as facilitator. Switzerland has a large community of Sri Lankan Tamil emigrants, and the country's decentralised federal political system has been cited as a potential model for the Indian Ocean island.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush, Kerry lock swords over who would be best commander in chief.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The question of who is best qualified to lead the US war on terror and douse the flames of insurgency in Iraq has taken over the presidential debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry. "I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who's the person who could be a commander in chief, who can get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace," Kerry said Thursday, during the first nationally televised debate between the candidates. The event at the University of Miami saw the two rivals slug it out as they vied to convince viewers over who has the better character to lead the nation and head off a repeat of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. "You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signal to our allies," the incumbent Republican president charged. "He changes positions on the war in Iraq," Bush said of Kerry. The Republicans have spent millions of dollars on campaign ads in recent months portraying Kerry as indecisive. Bush has criticised what he says are Kerry's multiple "nuances" on Iraq. Central to Bush's position is the argument the veteran Massachusetts senator cast a vote in Congress in 2002 authorising the president to go to war against Iraq and Saddam Hussein, but has since lambasted the war. Kerry, for his part, has slammed Bush for being too stubborn and out of touch on key issues. "What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground. He's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem cell research or of global warming and other issues. And certainty sometimes (this) can get you in trouble," Kerry countered. Democrats say Bush's stubborn desire to topple former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein has diverted vital US resources from what they say is the real war on terror: Al-Qaeda and the hunt for its leader, Osama bin Laden. They say Bush's decision to invade Iraq has reaped chaos, cost American lives and money, and that Bush's pre-invasion justifications for the war, weapons of mass destruction, have never been proved. Each man claims to have a better character than his opponent. "I've never wavered in my life. I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq and my position has been consistent," Kerry, a decorated Vietnam war veteran, said. "I defended this country as a young man in war and I will defend it as president of the United States," he stressed. Bush said he was an instinctive leader who sticks to his guns. "Of course, we change tactics when need to but we never change our beliefs," Bush said. Both camps claimed their candidate would be the better commander in chief after the first debate of three ended. White House communications director Dan Bartlett said: "I think he (Bush) spoke from the heart and spoke with strength about the necessity for our country to fight the terrorists over there so we don't have to face them here at home." Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards, countered that "People saw the next commander in chief." "This man (Kerry) is so ready to keep this country safe and to lead America, and the American people saw that last night." American voters will have the ultimate say when they cast their ballots on November 2.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LAGOS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Talks between Nigerian government officials and Niger Delta rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari entered a third day under the shadow of a rebel deadline for foreign oil workers to quit the area where the industry is based. President Olusegun Obasanjo said Friday in a speech that he was discussing with rebels in Niger delta and that a "rapprochement is taking place" and he assured that "peace, stability and harmony will return" to the region. A member of Asari's entourage told AFP Friday by telephone that he has gone to the presidency to continue the talks and that some state governors from the region and other stakeholders were participating in the meeting. Receptionists in Asari's Abuja hotel said at 4.15 pm (1515 GMT) that the rebel leader was not in his room but confirmed that he has not checked out yet. On Monday, Asari, leader of the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), issued a statement saying that the group wants more rights and greater autonomy for the region's native Ijaw people and ordered multinationals and foreigners out of the delta, hub of Nigeria's lucrative oil industry. He said his rebel group would declare all-out war on the government on October 1 if the rebels' demands were not met. In an inte oil exporter, derives more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange earnings from oil. The unrest and war rumblings in the delta region have sent oil prices on an upward spiral which saw them burst through the 50-dollar-a-barrel barrier on Tuesday, but drop back below the crucial mark when the peace talks began. Troops deployed to to the region intensified their search for arms illegally acquired by rebels and militia groups, the captain of the military operation, Yakubu Agwom, told AFP. Obasano, a former military head of state, has vowed to be firm against the rebels who threatened oil production and export, Nigeria's economic jugular. Nigeria, Africa's largest producer and OPEC sixth exporter, produces 2.5 billion barrels daily. Obasanjo, in his broadcast, recognised, for the first time, that the government had little impact in the impoverished region and accused state authorities of shirking their responsibilities to the people. "The obvious assessment so far is that not much impact has been made on the lives and living standards of most ordinary people of the Niger Delta," he said. Some officials told AFP that Obasanjo was particularly irked by the action of certain state governors in the region who mismanage, according to him, resources allocated by the central federal government to the states.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A Lebanese minister who resigned in a dispute over Syria's domination of the country was wounded in a Beirut car bombing Friday, as a UN report blasted Syria for failing to meet demands for the respect of Lebanon's sovereignty. The bombing, described by many as an attack on Lebanon's democracy, came as Uthe nation, the Democratic Gathering and the PSP." It vowed that "the civil war sought by some parties will not come via the PSP, which is conscious of such cheap attempts." Lebanese President Emile Lahoud ordered "police and judicial authorities to uncover the (truth) behind this act. which aimed at creating national discord," a statement said. Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, who has close ties with Hamadeh, also ordered "security officials. to promptly uncover those behind this odious crime that targets all honorable men". British ambassador James Watts, one of a number of people to visit Hamadeh in hospital, said "this is a very serious incident. Angry shouts emanated from the crowd at the entrance of the hospital as Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam declared that "the Syrian leadership, headed by President Bashar al-Assad, was in great shock went it learned of the attempt on the life against brother and friend Marwan Hamadeh." "Hamadeh is one of the political personalities that exerted great efforts for the national accord in Lebanon and for the consolidation and coordination of Lebanese-Syrian relations," he told reporters. US Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman and his French counterpart, Phillipe Le Courtier, as well as Patrick Renaud, chief of the European Union commission in Lebanon also visited the hospital. Hamadeh, whose mother in French, is one of four ministers who quit on September 6 to protest a controversial Syrian-inspired constitutional amendment that kept Lahoud, a Damascus protege, as head of state for another three years. That move came only a day after Resolution 1559 was adopted September 2. On Wednesday, Syria wrapped up a limited troop pullout of about 3,000 soldiers, leaving about 15,000 troops on Lebanese soil, down from a peak of between 35,000 and 40,000 during the Lebanese civil war.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAMAKO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Malian police arrested three people Friday for child trafficking, busting an intercontinental ring that has for four years been sending infants and young girls from Mali to Europe by way of Morocco. Charges of using and diffusing fake passports were also brought against two nationals of the Democratic Republic of Congo and a Malian national, retired soldier Cheick Oumar Fofana, a judicial source told AFP. If convicted they face up to 20 years in prison. The children were sold to families under the pretense of adoption, while the girls were forced into prostitution to repay the mules who got them out of Africa and into Europe. Many of them remained prostitutes once their debts were paid, according to the Malian police. Fofana told police in his preliminary interviews that the ring had been operating for at least four years and said "many, many" children and girls had been sent to Europe. Police seized false diplomatic passports in the bust and also recovered six children, one of whom was four years old. Mali has signed three agreements with its neighbors to fight child trafficking in a bid to ensure a secure environment for all exploited children sent across African borders. The UN children's agency UNICEF has said trafficking in human beings occurs in 89 percent of African nations, with sexual and economic exploitation the most important factors fuelling the trade. Child welfare activists say that while no numbers are accurate, it is estimated that some 200,000 children are trafficked around the world's poorest continent.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[London stocks, which closed at a two-year high Friday, could break higher again next week despite high oil prices, with a Bank of England interest rate decision unlikely to spoil the party, analysts said. The FTSE 100 index of leading London shares closed at 4,659.6 points on Friday, up 81.5 points, or 1.78 percent, over the week. "UK equities are outperforming most other major equity markets after adjusting for exchange rate gains or losses," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities. London's FTSE 100 can "expect a big move" in the short term, Morgan Stanley analyst Teun Draaisma said. "We think the next big move has at least a two-thirds chance to be up, and at most a third chance to be down." British stocks, like their European counterparts, largely shook off the fact that crude oil prices broke the 50-dollar mark this week for the first time in the 21-year history of oil futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. "The oil price rise impedes growth to a degree, but even at 50 dollars per barrel there still exists only a modest effect on the global economy," said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at stockbrokers Charles Stanley. The Bank of England's nine-member monetary policy committee convenes next Wednesday for a two-day meeting to decide its latest move over the cost of British borrowing, with most economists expecting interest rates to remain at 4.75 percent after five quarter-point hikes since November. "The Bank of England meeting looks a forgone conclusion, with no change," HSBC economists said. On the British corporate calendar, BP is due to deliver a trading update on Monday while AstraZeneca is due to unveil a strategy update on Wednesday.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush's smirk and Kerry's smile send the wrong message, say experts =.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[George W. Bush needs to get rid of the grimaces and smirks, John Kerry is still struggling to put on a natural smile, experts said Friday after the first presidential debate between the two rivals. While Kerry was given the best marks in some polls after Thursday night's debate, communications experts said both contenders must work on their body language ahead of the two remaining presidential debates and the November 2 election. According to Patti Wood, an Atlanta-based body language consultant, Bush had an assured first 30 minutes at the crucial first debate. "But he seemed to run out of planned stuff to say and I think he became emotional," added Wood, who has advised the US military and top firms on communications and body language. "He repeated himself so much. When you repan executives, said the US president had been effective in reaching his core Christian right voter base. Bush took control at the start of the debate by marching over to Kerry's side of the stage to shake his hand, said Bonner. But he also highlighted Bush's grimaces while Kerry was attacking his record on Iraq. "The reactions showed Bush looking perplexed or flummoxed," said Bonner. But the faces are not all bad for the president. "Although it is not the kind of facial expressions I would counsel, I think it was authentic. Bush breaks a lot of rules but at least he is seen as authentic." Bonner said that Kerry swayed too much, "a bit like a horse", and this made him look ineffective sometimes. "Swaying below the waist can make him look shifty. I was surprised by his body movement." Bonner and other experts say that 50-70 percent of the impact made by speakers can come from their non-verbal body actions. The Republican and Democratic campaigns set out 32 p villages and creeks. Our efforts have paid off," naval Lieutenant Commander Yakubu Agwom told AFP by telephone from his base in Buguma, west of Port Harcourt, the hub of Nigeria's vast oil resources. Buguma is the home town of rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari, who is fighting for a share of Nigeria's oil wealth and who arrived in the capital Abuja Wednesday for peace talks with government officials. Agwon said security men raided a village near Buguma early this week and found some weapons. "A cache of arms and ammunitions such as AK-47 rifles were found in the village. Although the villagers claimed the weapons were for self-defence against attack by armed gangs terrorising them, they cooperated with security agents by surrendering them," he said. He said ethnic militia and cult gangs such as Dey Gbam, Greenlanders, Egbesu Boys, Bush Boys, Icelanders, Elegamface and Okrika Boys were stockpiling arms to fight for supremacy in the region. The spokesman of the special military Joint Task Force (JTF) deployed to the troubled areas, Captain Onyema Kanu, said that current operation coded "Operation Flush Out 3", will continue after ongoing talks between President Olusegun Obasanjo and rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari. "The JTF has a clear and broad mandate to rid the region of armed gang violence and bunkering. The operation will continue in spite of the talks unless we are otherwise directed," he told reporters in Port Harcourt. The armed struggle is financed by illegal bunkering -- stealing of crude oil from tapped pipelines before selling it to unscrupulous local and foreign buyers. Officials say Nigeria loses some 50,000 barrels of oil daily to smugglers and sea pirates operating in the hundreds of creeks and swamps dotting the Niger delta. Some 500 people have died in gang violence in the past month in Port Harcourt and its surrounding creeks, according to Amnesty International, but the government said only 13 were kollars. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo warned Friday that his government would not tolerate any act of "undue militancy" in the Niger Delta. "Government is taking appropriate steps to stem the tide of undue militancy and we are confident that reason and the law will prevail," he said in a broadcast to mark the anniversary of independence from Britain. "Government will not tolerate in any way or form any act that would mortgage or compromise the interest of the majority." On Friday, the presence of troops was very visible in Port Harcourt but there was little or no celebration for the independence anniversary.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Brazil may have tapped into Pakistani nuclear smuggling network - US expert by Michael Adler.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[VIENNA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Brazil may have acquired key nuclear technology it is trying to keep UN atomic inspectors from seeing from a nuclear smuggling network that also supplied Iran, Libya and North Korea, a US non-proliferation expert said Friday. "Look at the performance (data) of these centrifuges (in Brazil). They look very similar to the P2," sold by disgraced Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan's network, Henry Sokolski, a former Pentagon official who now runs the Non-Proliferation Policy Education Center think tank in Washington, told AFP by telephone. But International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said "there is no indication so far that any other country shopped from the Khan network" beyond Iran, Libya and North Korea. The Vienna-based IAEA is investigating Iran on US charges that Tehran is secretly developing nuclear weapons. It is also trying to trace the operations of the Khan network, which has been exposed after Khan, the father of Pakistan's atomic bomb, was arrested earlier this year. Centrifuges are used to enrich uranium, a process that makes what can be fuel for civilian reactors but also the explosive core of atomic bombs. Brazil has since February blocked IAEA inspectors from coming to inspect its uranium enrichment facilities. Sokolski said the Brazilians "do not want anyone to see the shapes of the casings and rotors" of their centrifuges. IAEA inspectors are due to arrive in Brazil on October 15 to try to resolve the dispute. The Brazilian science and technology ministry has stressed that IAEA inspectors "will only have access to parts indispensable to the application of guarantees, without revealing the cores of the centrifuges." "After a five-month suspension, negotiations on the inspection of the plant have resumed," Science and Technology spokeswoman Vera Canfran told AFP. Brazil, which has one of the world's largest uranium reserves, denied IAEA inspectors access in February and March to a uranium-enriching facility in Resende, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, saying it wanted to protect industry trade secrets. IAEA director general Mohamed ElBaradei has said Brazil, which is widely believed to have a peaceful nuclear program, should not be an exception to IAEA norms. IAEA spokeswoman Fleming said talk about Brazil as a possible Khan client "does not seem to fit what the IAEA knows about Brazil's nuclear program nor does it correspond to our talks with them so far." Sokolski said "people say Brazil worked on its latest technology in the late 1990's," a reference to the period when the Khan network was especially active. He said Brazil might have turned to the Khan network in order to make financial and technological shortcuts in developing centrifuges. But experts close to the IAEA told AFP they did not trona, in a time of 4hr 33min 33sec. Dutchman Thomas Dekker came second to take the silver medal ahead of Mads Christensen of Denmark. Both riders arrived around a minute later. In an exciting race involving some of the peloton's future stars Siutsou's win came after a stylish breakaway in the final lap which ultimately left his longtime breakaway companion Domenico Pozzovivo out of the medals. Pozzovivo had been with the Belarussian for the latter part of the race but the 22-year-old Italian ended up finishing fourth as Dekker and Christensen bore down on him. "We didn't realise we had such a big gap on the chasing group," explained Siutsou. "And we only started believing we had the chance of a medal near the end." Siutsou however didn't hang around to sprint with the Italian at the finish line. Instead, he attacked Pozzovivo on the way up the three-kilometre Torricelle climb a few kilometres from the finish. Pozzovivo had trouble giving chase, and bynext season. Dekker missed out on the time trial gold a few days ago, but admitted: "I'm not so disappointed. Two silvers from two races is not so bad."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Pakistan has killed 100 Al-Qaeda members in tribal areas: Musharraf.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ISLAMABAD, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[One hundred Al-Qaeda operatives hiding in Pakistan's rugged tribal district bordering Afghanistan have been killed by the military, President President Pervez Musharraf said Friday. ". we have so far eliminated 100 Al-Qaeda operatives, who were hiding in Waziristan," state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Musharraf as telling reporters on board his aircraft. Musharraf did not specify the time period during which the militants were killed. The Pakistani military has conducted several operations this year against Al-Qaeda hideouts and training camps in Waziristan and officials have said more than 150 foreign Al-Qaeda-linked militants have been killed in the past 12 months. South Waziristan hugs Afghanistan's insurgency-hit southeast province of Paktika, where Taliban remnants and other militants have been killing aid agency staff, troops and civil workers for more than a year. Musharraf said Pakistan is taking military and political action to flush out Al-Qaeda terrorists from the mountainous tribal areas. "We target only foreign elements after confirmation of their presence through intelligence sources -- our operations have been precise. ," Musharraf said on his way back home from visits to the United States, the Netherlands and Italy. "The collateral damage has been minimum in operations against terrorists." Pakistan's military operations have triggered strong protests from radical Islamic parties as well the secular opposition, who demand that a political solution be found to the problem of hundreds of foreigners in the tribal belt. Officials suspect some 600 to 700 mainly Uzbek and Chechen fighters allied to Al-Qaeda are still hiding in the area. Hundreds of militants are believed to have fled to the region from Afghanistan in late 2001 when the Taliban were toppled after a US-led military offensive. Pakistani forces have recently further stepped up vigilance in the frontier belt to prevent cross border activity by militants intent on disrupting landmark October 9 presidential elections in Afghanistan. Pakistan has also intensified its battle against Al-Qaeda militants hiding in other cities and provinces this month. Amjad Farooqi, Pakistan's most wanted militant, was shot dead during a two-hour gunbattle at his rural hideout north of Karachi on (last) Sunday. Farooqi, 30, helped hide the alleged chief plotter of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and was closely associated with Al-Qaeda's new operations chief, Libyan Abu Faraj Farj, according to investigators. He was also one of four men who reportedly kidnapped US reporter Daniel Pearl in Karachi in January 2002 and recruited the trio arrested with him to slit Pearl's throat. He had been indicted over Pearl's murder. In addition, Farooqi has been named the mastermind of attempts to kill Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf last December. The militant had evaded a massive nationwide manhunt for nine months. Pakistani security agencies have arrested another 11 Islamic militants since killing Farooqi, officials have said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[UNITED NATIONS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Syria has not complied with a UN Security Council demand to pull its troops out of Lebanon and said it cannot give a timetable for doing so, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan reported on Friday. After studying progress on a council resolution last month calling for all foreign troops to get out of the country, Annan said Lebanon and Syria had both indicated that the soldiers were there at Beirut's request. "The government of Syria has informed me that it cannot provide me with numbers and timetables for any future withdrawal," Annan said in the report, released to the press. "The requirements on the various parties set out in resolution 1559 have not been met," he said. "The governments of both Lebanon and Syria have told me that the Syrian forces present in Lebanon. are there at the invitation of Lebanon and that their presence is therefore by mutual agreement," Annan said. The report was issued just hours after an apparent assassination attempt in Beirut on Lebanon's outgoing Economy and Trade Minister Marwan Hamadeh, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the Syrian presence. The minister's bodyguard was killed and his driver was injured in the bomb attack. The United States and France pressed hard for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution last month after a constitutional amendment allowed President Emile Lahoud, a Syrian protege, to stay for an extra term in office. The resolution, which was adopted by the bare minimum of nine votes in favour with six abstentions, made no specific reeatedly declined any interference by Damascus in its neighbour's internal affairs. "The government of Lebanon has stated to me that its ultimate goal is the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory," he said. He said Beirut also said it "intends that all irregular armed groups ultimately be disarmed and disbanded," in a clear reference to the militant group Hezbollah, whose guerrilla war helped end the Israeli occupation. There had been no change in the status of the organisation, a powerful force in the south since the Israelis left, since the resolution was passed, Annan said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Justice Department said Friday it would not appeal a court decision allowing Oracle to pursue takeover bid for rival business software maker PeopleSoft. US antitrust regulators had sought to block the bid, claiming it would hinder competition, but US District Judge Vaughn Walker rejected the government's arguments on September 9. "While we disagree with the district court's disappointing decision, we respect the role of the courts in the United States merger review process," said R. Hewitt Pate, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "Similarly, while we disagree with some of the legal observations in the district court's opinion, the ultimate outcome rested on detailed factual findings that would appropriately receive great deference in the appellate process." The Justice Department had argued that Oracle, PeopleSoft and Germany's SAP are the only companies that develop and sell the high-end integrated human resource and financial management software used by big companies and government agencies. Oracle bucked convention and court odds in defending itself against the suit. Typically corporations give up on takeover efforts if Justice Department lawyers deem they would be anti-competitive. The decision came the same day that PeopleSoft's board of directors fired cheif executive Craig Conway, who had led the resistance to the Oracle offer.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Jose Mourinho has promised sidelined midfielder Scott Parker that he has a future at Chelsea. The England midfielder is reported to be considering his future after making just one appearance this season, as a late substitute during the Premiership opener against Manchester United. Since then the 23-year-old has not figured and he appears to be behind Alexei Smertin, Frank Lampard, Geremi, Claude Makelele, Joe Cole and Tiago in the battle for places in the Chelsea midfield. But Mourinho urged him to be patient. "I have a lot of midfield players and none of them are injured - they are all fit and ready to play. But I can only use two or three of them and then put one more on the bench," the Portuguese manager said. "Someone has to miss out and at the moment Scott Parker has not been involved in the line-up or as sub. I can understand that and in fact I'm happy that Scott is not pleased with the situation. "If he is not being used many times and is happy with that then it means he has no motivation or ambition. But he is professional, working fantastically well every day and his chance will arrive. "When I read in the press about his unrest I just concentrate on the fact we are in September. Imagine if he is playing regularly in October or November - he won't want to leave Chelsea then."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bruce Springsteen gets political by Giles Hewitt.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rock star Bruce Springsteen will wear his political heart on his sleeve for the first time in concert Friday, when he adds his high-octane voice to the "Vote for Change" tour against President George W. Bush. With a loyal following on both sides of the bitter Democrat-Republican divide, the singer admits he is not entirely comfortable with his move into partisan campaigning. "There's some reluctance, certainly, to be coming out and doing what we're doing now," Springsteen told Knight Ridder newspapers in an interview ahead of a Friday night concert in Philadelphia. The show will be followed by a series of nationwide concerts in which he will appear with the likes of REM, Pearl Jam, the Dave Matthews Band, Bonnie Raitt, the Dixie Chicks and Sheryl Crow. Despite the social relevance of much of his work, Springsteen has until now kept a step away from direct involvement in politics, although he notably objected to the use of "Born in the USA" by Ronald Reagan during the 1984 presidential election. There have been complaints from fans and the 55-year-old acknowledges that some will be alienated by the concerts for the Americans Coming Together group that is trying to build support for Bush's Democratic challenger John Kerry. But he believes the stakes in the November 2 election are higher than any other he has known. "This election is about a set of ideals, and truthfulness, and creating the country you want your kids to grow up in," said Springsteen. "No other election I can remember has had that kind of significance to me." He said he agreed to join the tour after talking with other musicians who were also looking for "some way to have a collective impact." "I realized that this is the time. I can't sit this one out if I meant the things I've been writing about these 30 years." The tour concentrates on 12 battleground states that are expected to play a key role in deciding the next president. While the events are political, Springsteen said there will be no hard sell speeches. "There will be no intense speechifying from the stage, as far as I know," he said. But he believes the artistic impact of his songs will be different. "The same words are going to be. changed by the moment and the event. I actually think it will add clarity to some of my music, recast some of the things I've been saying in a clearer and more powerful light." He also believes that not everyone in the sell out crowd in Philadelphia will be a Kerry supporter. "We're going to find the Republicans in the crowd, and there will be a laying on of hands. We're going to convert people." he said, adding that a lot of people he meets have not made up their mind who to vote for. But the singer they call "The Boss" insists he sees no option but to sack Bush for the president's conduct over the Iraq war. "If you mg to the economy, to labour, the cost of health care and almost every issue that working class and middle class people care about, this administration has failed," she said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Economic data Friday showed strong factory activity in the United States as well as a surge in construction spending, although consumer sentiment was slightly weaker. The Institute for Supply Management reported its national index of manufacturing activity fell to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 percent in August. The decline was in line with expectations, with Wall Street analysts expecting a figure of 58.3. Any number above 50 indicates expansion, and the ISM said September marked the 16th straight month of expansion. "The manufacturing sector continued to grow during September, but at a slightly slower r "However the decline in new orders is less positive suggesting a slowdown over the coming months." Merrill Lynch's Sheryl King said the ISM report showed price pressures and slipping new orders, adding that "this suggests that firms continue to face cost pressures, adding to the squeeze they are feeling on profit margin." As a result of the positive ISM and strong construction report, King said, "It now looks like third quarter GDP (gross domestic product) will record a four percent annualized increase. However, the forward looking indicators in the ISM suggest that growth should moderate in the coming months." Wachovia economist Gina Martin said the construction report was especially good, more than double the Wall Street expectation. "If there is still a soft patch in the economy, it is certainly not in construction markets," she said.]]></c>

The winger had been expected to arrive in Cardiff on Monday but United have exercised their right not to release the player until four days before an international, meaning he will not now join up with his team-mates until late on Tuesday. Wales play England at Old Trafford on Saturday October 9 in a match that could be decisive for their chances of qualifying for Germany 2006. A United spokesman said the club was simply acting to ensure Giggs was properly rested after the Premiership match against Middlesbrough on Sunday and manager Sir Alex Ferguson justified the decision by saying: "We are doing nothing that is not exactly what the rule states." Football Association of Wales spokesman Ceri Stennett admitted there was nothing the Welsh could do about the situation. "United are well within their rights to invoke the four-day ruling, but I think it's fair to say we are all a bit surprised by this. "It will be interesting to see when the Manchester United players in the England squad are released, but we would expect Ryan to be in Cardiff by midnight on Tuesday." England will be preparing for the match at United's Carrington training ground and are due to have their first workout there on Tuesday afternoon.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SIALKOT, Pakistan, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A suspected suicide bomb blast ripped through a Shiite Muslim mosque during Friday prayers in the eastern Pakistani city of Sialkot, killing at least 30 people and leaving dozens injured, police said. Hundreds of worshippers were packed into the Mistri Abdullah Imambargah mosque in the city center when the huge explosion tore through the building, police spokesman Mohammad Ihsanullah told AFP. "Thirty people have died so far and toll may rise as some of the injured are in critical condition," police officer Syed Ishtiaq Hussain Shah told AFP near the site of blast. Body parts and blood were seen splattered across the interior of the mosque. The explosion left a large crater and caused extensive damage to the building. "We believe the bomber carried the explosive into the mosque in a briefcase which he detonated while sitting amongst the worshippers and also blew himself up," an intelligence official, who would not be identified, told AFP. "It is an act of terrorism. ," police chief Nisar Ahmed told AFP. "We believe a suicide bomber carried out the dastardly attack at a time when hundreds of worshippers were present inside the mosque for Friday's prayers." One of the wounded, Hamid Naqvi, said he and other worshippers had been listening to a sermon when "suddenly there was a big bang." "There was panic and there was blood and screams all around," he said. Naqvi, who was hit by shrapnel, was speaking from the city's Allama Iqbal hospital where doctors said at least 34 wounded people had been taken. "Some of the bodies have serious burn wounds," doctor Mohammad Ali told AFP. Several hundred angry protesters poured onto the streets outside the mosque after the blast and clashed with police, the police chief said. Private television channels reported that the army was called in to quell the unrest. People were shown crying and beating their chests. Some clashed with police and several police vehicles were burnt. Paramilitary rangers surrounded the mosque and allowed only reporters and photographers inside as a crowd gathered outside. A witness said police later found and defused another bomb, weighing about seven kilograms (15 pounds), outside the mosque. A bomb disposal squad official said that the unexploded device contained five kilograms of high explosives and two kilograms of other materials, including shrapnel, and would have been able to cause devastation within a 60-foot radius. "The bomb which exploded inside the mosque ressembled it," in terms of make-up, disposal squad chief Muhammad Anwar Waraich told AFP. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz condemned the attack. The incident "clearly shows that terrorists have no religion and are enemies of mankind", a state-run Associated Press of Pakother since the 1980s. The conflict has so far cost more than 4,000 lives. Pakistani officials say Osama bin Laden's Sunni fundamentalist Al-Qaeda network has been increasingly linking up with local Pakistani groups to launch terrorist attacks and fuel the sectarian conflict with the Shiite community. The hardline and banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was blamed for two bomb attacks on Shiite mosques in the southern port of Karachi in May and June which left 45 people dead. The latest bombing also comes as the Pakistani security forces are locked in a fierce battle against Al-Qaeda which has seen a number of important arrests since July. The most notable were Pakistani computer expert Naeem Noor Khan and Tanzanian Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, who has been indicted by a US court for his role in the twin bombing of American embassies in East Africa in 1998.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Four school children were killed and one seriously wounded near the Afghan border Friday when a landmine believed to have been planted by militants to target Pakistani troops exploded, residents and officials said. Five children, aged between 10 and 14, were walking to school in the northwestern tribal region when they triggered the landmine hidden on the road at Sarvakai, 60 kilometers (38 miles) east of Wana, the main town in the restive South Waziristan region, resident Saifur Rehman told reporters. "The children were going to school when they picked up a landmine which was planted by militants for sabotage activity to target security forces," military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told AFP. Two of the children were initially killed by the blast and two later died in hospital, Sultan said. He said security forces were later involved in a shootout with militants during which one man was killed and another wounded and arrested. "Both the foreign terrorists were planting an explosive device on a road when security forces surrounded them. (and) opened fire," he said. Three previous explosions in the rugged region have left eight soldiers dead and more than a dozen injured. Militants allegedly linked to Al-Qaeda and Taliban fugitives have stepped up attacks on the Pakistani army, which has been engaged in operations to flush out suspected militants and their local allies in the region. The military has said around 150 foreign militants have been killed in the region over the past 12 months during which the security forces have destroyed a number of militant hideouts including several training camps. Hundreds of suspected Al-Qaeda and Taliban elements are believed to be at large in the mountainous tribal belt which borders Afghanistan's insurgency hit south and southeastern provinces.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[THE HAGUE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Defence lawyers called on Friday for a Bosnian Serb officer accused of crimes against humanity over his role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre to be acquitted by the UN war crimes court here. "Dragan Jokic was not in a position of command. He is not responsible for giving orders to bury bodies. He did not know about what was taking place," his lawyer Miodrag Stojanovic argued before the tribunal in The Hague. More than 7,000 Muslim men and boys were slaughtered when Bosnian Serb forces overran the UN-protected enclave of Srebenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, considered the worst single atrocity on European soil since World War II. Jokic, who was the chief of engineers in the Zvornik brigade of the Bosnian Serb army which participated in the massacre, faces charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes. According to the prosecution, Jokic played a major role in trying to conceal the massacre by digging up mass graves and reburying victims at smaller hidden grave sites. Jokic has pleaded not guilty to the charges. "In the context of the genocide his work played a fundamental role in the events," the prosecution said on Wednesday, calling for a 15-20 year sentence. Jokic's lawyer emphasised that his client was the only Bosnian Serb officer to have turned himself in voluntarily to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and that he had "refused to take part" in planning the assault on Srebenica. Prosecutors have also requested a 32-year sentence for another officer indicted over the massacre, Vidoje Blagojevic, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of complicity in genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The verdict in the two men's trial is due in several months time. Three former officers and a soldier have so far been convicted by the UN court over their roles in the Srebenica massacre. Bosnian Serb general Radislav Krstic, the only man found guilty of aiding and abetting genocide by the UN court here so far, was sentenced to 35 years in prison last April. Momir Nikolic and Dragan Obrenovic, two former Bosnian Serb officers were sentenced to 27 and 17 years respectively after pleading guilty to charges of crimes against humanity. Another soldier, Drazen Erdemovic, has been handed a five-year sentence.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[VIENNA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei leaves Vienna Saturday for a trip to South Korea and Japan, that comes as his agency is investigating Seoul for hidden atomic activities and as the agency's head is being tipped as a possible Nobel Peace Prize winner. ElBaradei's trip to South Korea, where he is due to address a conference in Seoul, was scheduled before news broke of South Korea's activities, according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) spokeswoman Melissa Fleming. "He's also using the opportunity to take up a longstanding invitation by South Korea to make a bilateral state visit. There are a number of topics he wishes to discuss and of course he understands that the recent revelation about nuclear experiments will come up in the discussions," Fleming said. IAEA inspectors were last week in South Korea to investigate Seoul's past secret experiments involving potential ingredients for nuclear bombs. Yonhap news agency said inspectors had taken about 20 samples of nuclear material and waste back to the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna. Seoul revealed in September that its scientists secretly enriched a tiny amount of plutonium in 1982 and uranium in 2000. South Korea says the laboratory experiments were not linked to nuclear weapons programs. ElBaradei, however, has expressed "serious concern" about the activities. ElBaradei travels Wednesday to Japan, where he will be on Friday when the Nobel Peace Prize is to be announced in Oslo. Observers have said they expect the Nobel committee this year to hail efforts to halt nuclear arms proliferation, tapping as likely winners the IAEA and its chief ElBaradei. After playing a vital role in the inspections of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's weapons arsenal and the search for his suspected nuclear program, the IAEA is currently struggling to get Iran to halt controversial uranium enrichment-related activities and to get to the bottom of North Korea's secretive nuclear program.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[New twists boost Oracle in Silicon Valley battle for PeopleSoft.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Silicon Valley battle between Oracle and PeopleSoft took a new turn Friday as PeopleSoft dumped the chief executive leading its takeover defense, and US regulators dropped their antitrust case. PeopleSoft said it was terminating president and chief executive Craig Conway, who has led the fight against a 7.7 billion dollar hostile takeover effort from rival Oracle. The company said its board voted to appoint Dave Duffield, the company founder and chairman, as CEO, and announced the appointment of two co-presidents. "These appointments followed the board's decision to terminate Craig Conway as president and CEO of the company, effective immediately," the PeopleSoft statement said. "The board said its decision resulted from a loss of confidence in Mr. Conway's ability to continue to lead the company." Meanwhile the Justice Department's top antitrust official said the government would not appeal a court decision allowing Oracle to pursue its takeover bid. US antitrust regulators had sought to block the bid, claiming it would hinder competition, but US District Judge Vaughn Walker rejected the government's arguments on September 9. "While we disagree with the district court's disappointing decision, we respect the role of the courts in the United States merger review process," said R. Hewitt Pate, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "Similarly, while we disagree with some of the legal observations in the district court's opinion, the ultimate outcome rested on detailed factual findings that would appropriately receive great deference in the appellate process." The Justice Department had argued that Oracle, PeopleSoft and Germany's SAP are the only companies that develop and sell the high-end integrated human resource and financial management software used by big companies and government agencies. Oracle bucked convention and court odds in defending itself against the suit. Typically corporations give up on takeover efforts if Justice Department lawyers deem they would be anti-competitive. PeopleSoft's shares rose sharply after the PeopleSoft shakeup as Wall Street bet on a takeover, and possibly more consolidation in the sector. The shares climbed further after the Justice Department announcement. Analyst Art Hogan of Jefferies and Co. said it was too early to say for sure that the ouster of Conway clears the way for a merger with Oracle, but Wall Street appears to be seeing it that way. "The obvious interpretation is that this makes the deal more doable," Hogan said. Hogan expected to see strength in the software sector on anticipation of more merger activity. "If this deal happens, its starts the daisy chain of a whole lot more merger and acquisition activity," he said. Hugh Johnson of First Albany said he was unsure if the Conway ouster clears the way for the Oracle bid, but he added "that certainly would be my knee-jerk reaction." PeopleSoft provided few clues as to its course of action in the face of the Oracle bid: "Commenting on Oracle's tender offer, (independent director) Skip Battle noted that all decisions with respect to Oracle's tender offer have been made on the unanimous recommendation of the Transaction Committee of the Board."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Formule One supremo Bernie Ecclestone insisted on Friday that the British Grand Prix has no chance whatsoever of making it back on to the 2005 calendar. Ecclestone believes that his decision to drop Silverstone from the provisional schedule will be comfortably endorsed when it goes before the FIA's world council on October 13. "They can't ratify anything. I put the calendar together and that's it," Ecclestone told BBC rad "The problem is that it's a club, not a commercial operation, so they look at things a little bit differently to maybe how a commercial person would look at it." Despite the controversy, Ecclestone believes Silverstone can reclaim its place in the world championship. "If they want to take a couple of years off and rebuild the circuit and if they can make it work we're happy to come back again. I didn't want to leave," he said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Dollar little changed in cautious market after in-line ISM data (RECASTS with late trade).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The dollar was little changed against major currencies Friday after key US ISM data on manufacturing was in line with expectations, as the market remained cautious on the prospects for the US economy. The single European currency fell to 1.2398 dollars in late trade from 1.2435 late Thursday in New York. The dollar rose to 110.39 yen from 110.02 Thursday. The Institute for Supply Management reported that US factory activity had eased just slightly, with its headline index falling to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 in August, suggesting that the US economic recovery was gaining some traction. "This report was not as strong as the Chicago PMI report for September. Nevertheless, the level of this index is consistent with continued very solid growth in manufacturing activity," Bear Stearns analysts said in a statement. The solid report caused only a very limited rise in the dollar, however, with the market still remaining cautious on the outlook for the US economy amid fears over the impact of higher oil prices. "We continue to view levels of US yields as low relative to our own expectations for growth, inflation and Fed (Federal Reserve) policy in the coming months, and are thus cautious about the prospects for the dollar to break out of its broad consolidation range and resume its structural downtrend at this time," said Daniel Katzive, currency analyst at UBS. Investors are also unwilling to adjust positions ahead of the Group of Seven meeting this weekend, analysts said. The yen meanwhile remained stable at lower levels against the dollar, experiencing a touch of consolidation after rising on the back of the morning's strong Tankan survey. Elsewhere, the pound recovered slightly but remained weak after falling sharply on the back of a survey showing British manufacturing activity weakened in September. The pound fell to an eight-month low against the euro earlier in the day, taking the single European currency above the psychologically important 0.69-pound barrier. Analysts said markets were now far less certain that the Bank of England would put up interest rates again in November as previously expected. The central bank has raised rates by a quarter point five times since November last year, taking the key repo rate to 4.75 percent, with expectations of further hikes previously providing the reason for the pound's outperformance. News that Prime Minister Tony Blair had undergone what was said to be a minor procedure to correct a heart problem also added to the pound's woes. The euro was changing hands at 1.2398 dollars against 1.2435 late on Thursday in New York, 136.91 yen (136.79), 0.6897 pounds (0.6861) and 1.5494 Swiss francs (1.5492). The dollar stood at 110.39 yen (110.02) and 1.2496 Swiss francs (1.2455). The pound was at 1.7976 dollars (1.8117), 198.49 yen (199.27) and 2.2465 Swiss francs (2.2565). On the London Bullion Market, the price of an ounce of gold stood at 418.10 dollars against 415.65 late on Thursday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PORT OF SPAIN, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Grenada's Prime Minister Keith Mitchell said here Friday he did not believe anyone would try to overthrow his administration while he is away from the hurricane-ravaged Caribbean state, making an appeal for international aid. "While I believe there are elements who may still wish they might be able to take over government by force and survive, I think they are living in a fool's paradise. They don't have a ghost of a chance of succeeding," Mitchell told reporters. "We don't wish to have any upheaval in Grenada, and we hope and pray no one will try anything," he added. In 1979, a rebellion against the government of Sir Eric Gairy resulted in Maurice Bishop becoming prime minister. But Bishop himself was killed in a palace coup in 1983 that sparked a US-led invasion. Mitchell was due to fly to Washington Friday to seek international aid for his island, devastated by Hurricane Ivan early last month. Late Thursday, he met with Trinidad and Tobago opposition leader Basdeo Panday, who promised that his United National Congress party will send food to the devastated Caricom state. Meanwhile, Len Ishmael, director general of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, is urging political parties on the island to put aside their differences and focus on rebuilding the country. Ishmael, who recently led a team to assess damages, said unity was needed at this crucial time in Grenada. His mission produced a comprehensive report which outlines a long recovery and rehabilitation process for the island. It put overall damages at over 850 million dollars, which represents the gross domestic product for two years. The report will form the basis on which regional officials will appeal for funding to rebuild Grenada at an international donor conference in Washington on Monday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JABALIYA, Gaza Strip, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[When children told Um Fadi that her son was wounded in an Israeli air strike Friday on the embattled Jabaliya refugee camp, she rushed to the hospital, only to find out he had fallen as a "martyr". "Why did they kill him. He was unarmed and hadn't even hurled stones," wailed the mother outside the morgue where laid the lifeless body of her 28-year-old son Nidal Mattar. "May God take revenge on Israel and (Israeli Prime Minister Ariel) Sharon," cried Um Fadi, a mother of six wearing a traditional embroidered Palestinian dress and a loosely tied white veil over her head. Mattar, a captain in the Palestinian security forces, died with another two civilians Friday morning when an Israeli helicopter fired a missle on the Al-Sikka neighborhood of the Jabaliya refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip. The impoverished camp, home to 100,000 Palestinian refugees, has been the scene of fierce fighting between gunmen and Israeli troops since heavy armour rolled into the northern Gaza Strip three days ago to prevent militant rocket attacks on southern Israel. Forty-five Palestinians and five Israelis have died since. Mattar had spent 10 years in an Israeli jail before being released a few months before the start of the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, four years ago. "I would have preferred he stayed in prison where I could visit him. He's gone now and I'll never see him again," sighed Um Ali whose family originally hails from a village now in Israel. Mohammed Abu Layla, 17, said he witnessed the deadly air raid. "I was in the area. I did not recognize Nidal the martyr when I saw him because his head was half gone," he said. The slain security man and nine other Palestinians from Jabaliya, who died in the last 24 hours, were laid to rest in the Martyrs' Cemetery after Friday's noon prayers. Around 30,000 angry mourners followed the funeral procession as they cried for vengeance against Israel. Israeli choppers were flying overhead and fired at armed militants in the crowd who rushed to take cover and shoot back from nearby alleys. Forty houses were destroyed in Jabaliya where the water, telephone and electricity networks were also badly damaged. Sharon ordered the army to step up the operation codenamed "Days of Penitence" Thursday night, a day after two Israeli toddlers were killed in rocket attack on Sderot, just across the Gaza border.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BEIRUT, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A car bombing Friday that targeted a Lebanese minister who resigned in protest at Syria's domination of the country has put Damascus and its allies in Beirut in a delicate position amid continued international pressure for a Syrian troop withdrawal from Lebanon. The bombing, which some described as a "police state" attack on Lebanon's democracy, came as UN chief Kofi Annan accused Syria and its ruling allies in neighboring Lebanon of having failed to abide by Security Council Resolution 1559 that demands the pullout of Syrian troops in Lebanon. The crucial Annan report, requested by the resolution, also said that Damascus and Beirut failed to provide a timetable for any future Syrian pullout. Outgoing Economy and Trade Minister Marwan Hamadeh, a close advisor to prominent Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, was lightly wounded, his bodyguard killed and his driver slightly wounded in the Beirut morning attack. Although Jumblatt preferred to await results of an investigation into the blast, a statement by his party, the leftist mainly Druze Progressive Socialist Party, blamed the "police state" for the attack. "The police state. has proven its efficiency in targeting one of the symbols of the nation, the Democratic Gathering and the Progressive Socialist Party," it said in a statement. The party said the attack fell within "the aggressive campaign targeting (Jumblatt) and which recently started with random arrests. to deter him from pursuing the struggle for a state of law and democracy." It even vowed that "the civil war sought by some parties will not come via the PSP, which is conscious of such cheap attempts." Political analyst Joseph Bahout told AFP that the parties behind the attack showed "that they were. losing control of the management of the Lebanese crisis." "The message of the authors of this attempt is to tell the Lebanese opposition: It is us or chaos. But the resort to such acts is rather short-sighted because it is a logic of blackmail with obsolete means." The attempt on Hamadeh's life came about 10 hours before Annan presented his report on compliance with Resolution 1559, which was co-sponsored by the United States and France last month. Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri travelled to Paris late Thursday for talks with French President Jacques Chirac. The leading An-Nahar newspaper said France was pondering "two options" in light of the Annan report: an international monitoring group or a smaller follow-up committee for the implementation of Resolution 1559. US Secretary of State Colin Powell told AFP on Wednesday that Washington wanted Annan to present a "tough" report. The next day, Chirac "repeated France's desire to see Resolution 1559 implemented". Pressure on Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon where it maintains 15,000 troops, is even more painful since the country is under US-imposed unilateral sanctions on charges of harboring terrorists and interfering in Lebanese affairs. Hamadeh was one of four ministers who quit on September 6 to protest a controversial Syrian-inspired constitutional amendment that kept Lahoud, a Damascus protege, as head of state for another three years. His mentor, Jumblatt, has long been calling for more balanced relations between Damascus and Beirut, and for an end to Syrian and Lebanese security services' involvement in Lebanese political life. The Christian opposition had recently rallied to back Jumblatt who had become the target of verbal attacks by pro-Syrian Lebanese figures. "Continuing the current policy. would put Lebanon outside international legality," warned a statement by the Christian opposition group, Qornet Shehwan.]]></c>

Company director Francois Migraine, who almost withdrew sponsorship when the team was embroiled in a recent doping controversy, said he had decided to place his trust in cycling's new ProTour series. "If we're going to take part in the ProTour, it's not just to be in it for a year," Migraine told AFP by telephone when contacted from the world cycling road race championships here in Verona. "The only thing that will force us out (of the ProTour) would be revelaill be thouroughly tested," added Migraine. Riders in the team will undergo regular tests on hair and their blood to detect banned or illegal substances. In Italy, meanwhile, Italian teams Saeco and Lampre are to merge ahead of the introduction of the new ProTour, which is scheduled for January 2005. The team will be led by Italians Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni, currently with Saeco, and Lampre's reigning world road race champion Igor Astarloa. The new team will be managed by Claudio Corti and Giuseppe Saronni, who are currently the respective managers of the two teams. The UCI ProTour, the full details of which have still to be resolved by the International Cycling Union, race organisers and teams, will be introduced in a bid to unify the sport and secure finances.]]></c>

The political climate has changed in both countries since both countries under former prime ministers Jose Maria Aznar and Jose Manuel Durao Barroso backed the US-led intervention in Iraq last year. Zapatero took office in April and swiftly fulfilled a pledge to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq while Santana Lopes was sworn in July, replacing centre-right Jose Manuel Durao Barroso but maintaining a broadly pro-US stance on the issue. Giving priority to bilateral issues, the pair agreed to fix June 30 next year as the date for the belated launch of a joint Iberian electricity market (MIBEL) which has been in the offing for three years.

		<d><![CDATA[KILKENNY, Ireland, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A revitalised Ernie Els went on a birdie blitz here on Friday to snatch the second round lead of the seven million dollar WGC American Express Championship. The 34-year-old shot a blistering eight-under 64 to go 11-under and take a two shot lead over first round leader Todd Hamilton of the United States and Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez. Hamilton carded a three-under 69 and Jimenez a four-under 68 to be nine-under for the tournament. Three back lay Justin Leonard and four off the pace were a host of players including Retief Goosen, Lee Westwood, Thomas Bjorn and Steve Flesch. Els was playing after a two week break to get away from the sport and forget about the disappointments of failing to clinch another Major this season - including his dramatic playoff loss to Hamilton at the British Open. "Right after the last Major it took me a couple of weeks to really get my thought process settled down. I was very disappointed. I came so close to winning four Majors this year. In three of the four I was there right till the death," explained Els. "I've had two weeks off and had time to reflect. I've got to feel encouraged about what happened. I definitly did something right. Now I'm raring to go. I've just got to dedicate myself and get back into the swing of things," he added. And get back into the swing he did. The South African opened with four straight birdies. Another at the ninth saw him go out in 31 - an impressive five-under. Els continued his birdie spree, collecting four more on the way home. He finished in perfect style on the 18th when he sank a 12 footer for par and keeping him at 11ven-over for his round and four-over for the championship. Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee, struggling in the rain, went out in five-over 41 but a hole-in-one at the 169-yard 11th gave him something to finally smile about. It was his second hole-in-one in Europe this year. Earlier he had holed in one at the PGA Championship at Wentworth.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SIALKOT, Pakistan, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A suspected suicide bomb blast ripped through a Shiite Muslim mosque during Friday prayers in the eastern Pakistani city of Sialkot, killing at least 30 people and leaving dozens injured, police said. Hundreds of worshippers were packed into the Mistri Abdullah Imambargah mosque in the city center when the huge explosion tore through the building, police spokesman Mohammad Ihsanullah told AFP. "Thirty people have died so far and toll may rise as some of the injured are in critical condition," police officer Syed Ishtiaq Hussain Shah told AFP near the site of blast. Body parts and blood were seen splattered across the interior of the mosque. The explosion left a large crater and caused extensive damage to the building. "We believe the bomber carried the explosive into the mosque in a briefcase which he detonated while sitting amongst the worshippers and also blew himself up," an intelligence official, who would not be identified, told AFP. "It is an act of terrorism. ," police chief Nisar Ahmed told AFP. "We believe a suicide bomber carried out the dastardly attack at a time when hundreds of worshippers were present inside the mosque for Friday's prayers." One of the wounded, Hamid Naqvi, said he and other worshippers had been listening to a sermon when "suddenly there was a big bang." "There was panic and there was blood and screams all around," he said. "Some of the bodies have serious burn wounds," doctor Mohammad Ali told AFP. Several hundred angry protesters poured onto the streets outside the mosque after the blast and clashed with police, the police chief said. Private television channels showed people crying and beating their chests. Some clashed with police and several police vehicles were burnt. Paramilitary rangers surrounded the mosque and allowed only reporters and photographers inside as a crowd gathered outside. A witness said police later found and defused another bomb, weighing about seven kilograms (15 pounds), outside the mosque. A bomb disposal squad official said that the unexploded device contained five kilograms of high explosives and two kilograms of other materials, including shrapnel, and would have been able to cause devastation within a 60-foot radius. "The bomb which exploded inside the mosque resembled it," in terms of make-up, disposal squad chief Muhammad Anwar Waraich told AFP. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz condemned the attack. The incident "clearly shows that terrorists have no religion and are enemies of mankind", a state-run Associated Press of Pakistan report quoted Musharraf as saying in a statement. Aziz said killing people at a place of worship was a "highly condemnable" act." "Islam is a religion of peace and abhors terrorism,nflict has so far cost more than 4,000 lives. The hardline and banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was blamed for two bomb attacks on Shiite mosques in the southern port of Karachi in May and June which left 45 people dead. The latest bombing also comes as the Pakistani security forces are locked in a fierce battle against Al-Qaeda which has seen a number of important arrests since July. The most notable were Pakistani computer expert Naeem Noor Khan and Tanzanian Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, who has been indicted by a US court for his role in the twin bombing of American embassies in East Africa in 1998.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SINJE, Liberia, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Dozens of Liberians were ferried back across the border from Sierra Leone Friday as part of a three-year UN effort to return some 340,000 people home from around west Africa after 14 years of war. Gospel chants and clapping carried the convoy from Tobanda and Gondoma refugee camps in eastern Sierra Leone along its three-day journey to Zimmi, where the group of 77 people, mostly women and children, crossed the Mano River bridge into Liberia. "We are very happy to come back home," said Kamara Wah, who with his wife and two children were among the refugees taken to Sinje transit center, 60 kilometers (36 miles) from the border. "There is no place like home." The effort begun Friday is the third for Liberia by the UN High Commissioner on Refugees in the last 15 years, following a rebellion launched by warlord Charles Taylor that vaulted him to power and the presidency he claimed in 1997. A second civil war erupted in 1999 and was brought to an end in August of last year. Twice-weekly convoys carrying the 67,000 Liberians in Sierra Leone are expected to ford the Bo Waterside crossing that has become a symbol for the war-ravaged neighbors -- first of despair and now of hope that peace will finally prevail after years of conflict. Another 100,000 are in other countries, such as Ghana and Nigeria, both of which have committed to assist the voluntary repatriation effort. A flight carrying 97 refugees from Accra arrived mid-afternoon at Liberia's international airport, UNHCR spokeswoman Francesca Fontanini told AFP. The repatriation effort for northern neighbor Guinea is set to begin in November, and UN and humanitarian officials hope it will quell tensions building in the forested border region where most of the 150,000 Liberian refugees live in camps. Observers on both sides of the border have noted an intense recruitment drive among the refugees, some of them former combatants, to encourage them to bear arms to oust ailing Guinean President Lansana Conte. No date has been set for the return of 75,000 Liberians in Ivory Coast, many of whom were targeted during a rash of xenophobic violence that flared in that country's west during a civil war that broke out in September 2002 and still simmers two years later. Tens of thousands of Liberians have flooded back into the country on their own since peace was declared in August last year, arriving to find their homes burned to the ground and their communities stripped bare.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[China calls on World Bank to help small cotton producers hit by trade deal.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[GENEVA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[China on Friday called on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help small textile and clothing exporting countries that are threatened by the end of import quotas at the end of the year. But the Asian giant insisted at a meeting at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva that caps on imports from individual countries imposed by the United States and European countries must end as scheduled on January 1, 2005. Chinese and Indian producers stand to make huge gains in their share of exports to major markets once the phase-out agreed in WTO's Agreement on Textiles and Clothing more than nine years ago is completed on January 1, squeezing out smaller exporters, according to studies. "Why should the multilateral trading system seek to turn back the hands of time." China's ambassador to the WTO Sun Zhenyu remarked. Sun said the 40-year-old reliance on quotas had disrupted the production and trade of textiles in developing countries which have a comparative advantage in the sector. The IMF and the World Bank had shown they were ready to help poor countries "make adjustments so as to support trade liberalisation efforts in the WTO," he added. "We call on those two institutions to significantly enhance their assistance programmes in order to better respond to the needs of the members," China's ambassador said. About 20 small or poor textile producing nations, including Mexico, Mauritius and Tunisia, have urged the rest of the WTO's members to temper the impact of the binding agreement, which they fear will lead to massive job losses. Mauritius ambassador Servan Singh told Friday's meeting of the WTO's council for trade in goods: "Some studies have suggested that the elimination of quotas and the further liberalisation of the sector may be beneficial to developing countries as a whole." "But they also clearly indicate that there will be more losers along with the winners in the process," he added. The United States and the European Union reiterated during the meeting that the quotas capping imports would be lifted as agreed from January, trade sources said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[UNITED NATIONS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Syria has not complied with a UN Security Council demand to pull its troops out of Lebanon and said it cannot give a timetable for doing so, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan reported on Friday. After studying progress on a council resolution last month calling for all foreign troops to get out of the country, Annan said Lebanon and Syria had both indicated that the soldiers were there at Beirut's request. "The government of Syria has informed me that it cannot provide me with numbers and timetables for any future withdrawal," Annan said in the report released to the press. "The requirements on the various parties set out in resolution 1559 have not been met," he said. A senior UN official told journalists: "Neither the government of Syria nor the government of Lebanon has provided us with any plans. the government of Syria indicated to us that there was no willingness to give us any." Annan said that both Beirut and Damascus had indicated that the Syrian troops were on the ground "at the invitation of Lebanon and that their presence is therefore by mutual agreement." The report was issued just hours after an apparent assassination attempt in Beirut on Lebanon's outgoing Economy and Trade Minister Marwan Hamadeh, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the Syrian presence. The minister's bodyguard was killed and his driver was injured in the bomb attack. The Unitas stated to me that its ultimate goal is the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory," he said. He said Beirut also said it "intends that all irregular armed groups ultimately be disarmed and disbanded," in a clear reference to the militant group Hezbollah, whose guerrilla war helped end the Israeli occupation.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MADRID, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A senior member of Spain's main conservative opposition Popular Party (PP) said the time was ripe for a reality check as the party opened its national congress Friday, six months after a general election defeat in the wake of the Madrid train bombings. The party had been widely predicted to win the March 14 election until Islamic extremists killed 191 commuters in Spain's worst ever terrorist attack on March 11 and its insistence that Basque extremists were responsible alienated some voters to aid a Socialist victory. Madrid Mayor, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, who made the opening speech to delegates and is seen as a future potential leader, said the party had to indulge in much soul-searching as it plots a return to government in 2008 and should not believe its loss at the polls was purely due to to March 11. "We have to admit we must have dome something wrong," said Gallardon, seen as a potential future leader and on the party's liberal wing. He added that "some misunderstandings have appeared in the past few years" between the party and the public at large which had helped to swing the pendulum towards the Socialists and added that the congress had to be seen as "an exercise in realism." Stressing the PP's commitment "to social realities" in the face of a government which is pursuing a radically liberal social agenda having Friday approved a plan to introduce gay marriages, Gallardon insisted that the party was centrist, progressive and backed a "tolerant and open society." Opinion polls repeatedly show two-thirds of voters support the Socialist government's progressive agenda. Mariano Rajoy, who led the PP to defeat after former prime minister Jose Maria Aznar stood down following two terms in office, will Sunday ask the party's 3,028 delegates to confirm him as party chairman -- but also show a wider audience that he can deliver a new and vibrant party. Jose Maria Aznar, prime minister from 1996 to 2004 and who personally anointed Rajoy as his successor six months before the election, is due to become honorary president this weekend, leading observers to speculate that he will continue to pull strings. Further complicating the task of making a fresh start is the lingering presence of 81-year-old Manuel Fraga, the last heavyweight survivor from the days of General Francisco Franco's military dictatorship. Fraga says he plans to keep on playing a major part in political life from his Galician fiefdom in the northwest, but the Popular Party is divided at regional level over his role.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said Friday that the UN court investigating atrocities in the former Yugoslavia had transferred a case to Serbian prosecutors for the first time. De Ponte announced the move after what she described as a "very fruitful" meeting with Vladimir Vukcevic, the chief prosecutor of Serbia's special court for war crimes and organised crime. "I must confirm that we had very fruitful conversations and he received a very important case because we are in the completion strategy. I have decided that a case would be transferred to Belgrade," she said. She gave no details on which case involving a suspect might be given to the Serbian prosecutors for investigation, which could then lead to a trial. "We have many other cases to transfer in the near future. I am impressed with the structures here at the tribunal and I am sure they will be able to do it -- I am sure they will be able to conduct a trial," she said. A spokeswoman for Del Ponte later clarified that she was not handing over the running for a trial to Serbia, but merely responsibility for an ongoing UN investigation into a war crimes suspect. Del Ponte, who works at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, arrived in Belgrade earlier Friday to attend a conference on war crimes. She was booed by a small group of supporters of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, the top war crimes suspect on trial at The Hague. Del Ponte is due to return to Belgrade on Monday for meetings with Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica amid mounting international pressure for Serbia to hand over one of the top suspects still at large, former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. Some 20 indictees, including four Serbian generals, are still at large in Serbia but Kostunica has said national stability is more important than their arrest and transfer to The Hague. "I have no problem with the judicial authorities and I would be happy if I had no problems when I meet political authorities on Monday," Del Ponte said. Mladic and Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic were charged in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Bosnia's 1992-95 war, notably the massacre of some 7,000 Muslims in the eastern town of Srebrenica. The four Serbian generals were indicted last year for their roles in the 1998-99 Kosovo conflict between Belgrade forces and separatist ethnic Albanians. A Serbian court issued warrants for their arrests only this week but so far they remain comfortably at large. Del Ponte insisted the generals must be tried at The Hague. A spokesman for the Serbian war crimes court, Bruno Vekaric, said no other fonternational isolation if it continued to obstruct the UN tribunal at The Hague.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LUXEMBOURG, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US software giant Microsoft said Friday that it was confident that it would succeed in an appeal against a European Union (EU) ruling that it had abused its market dominance. "We go forward with all the confidence that we had when we arrived and we go foward with the conviction that we brought with us that there must be a better way to address these issues," Brad Smith, Microsoft's chief lawyer, told reporters at the end of the two-day appeal hearing. The European Commision, the EU's executive arm, ruled in March that the company had to offer a version of its operating system Windows without its Media Player software, which offers access to audio and video content. The Brussels commission also required Microsoft to provide competitors with the information they needed to enable their products to communicate with Windows. Brussels also fined Microsoft nearly half a billion euros (dollars). The money has been paid into an escrow account, meaning it is held in trust and neither Microsoft nor the commission has access while the appeal is pending. The company insisted Friday that nobody would want to buy its Windows operating system without Media Player, the software titan claiming that users did not want a stripped-down version of its all-conquering system. Microsoft is appealing against both the judgement and, in this case, against the steps it has been ordered by the commission to take, until a decision is reached on the basic ruling. Smith said the measures would mean "billions of euros of costs on European consumers and software developers."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan will meet boxing promoter Frank Warren with one topic on the agenda - his future. The British boxing prodigy insisted after the Athens Games that he wanted to retain his amateur status with a vew to winning a gold medal, just like his hero Muhammed Ali, at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. But Warren will try to convince the 17-year-old lightweight that his best option is to turn professional in the near future to exploit the financial rewards awaiting his prodigious talent. The boxer from Bolton was due to be a guest of Warren's at Friday's IBF light welterweight fight between Ricky Hatton - another fighter in his stable - and the Delaware boxer Mike Stewart in Manchester. Warren told BBC Radio ahead of the meeting: "My offer is not dependent on him turning professional straight away. I'd like him to, but it's whenever he feels comfortable with it. "He'd be a great addition to the professional ranks. "I'm not going to try to persuade him. I'll make him an offer and it's up to him. "By the time the Beijing Games come around he could be world champion and make his financial future secure." Warren wants to give Khan the chance to cash in following his performance in Athens in a similar way to teenage football star Wayne Rooney who this summer moved from Everton to Manchester United for a fee of 30 million pounds. "By the time the Beijing Games come around he could be world champion and make his financial future secure. "If he does get to the Olympics then gets the flu he won't be able to participate," Warren said. In an attempt to delay Khan turning professional the British Amateur Boxing Association revealed last week it was ready to offer him a package worth 70,000 pounds (126,000 dollars) a year.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The world's first private manned spacecraft will make its second space flight in five days Monday in the final stage of its attempt to win a 10 million dollar prize, organisers said. SpaceShipOne is scheduled to take off at around 7:00 am (1400 GMT) and blast out of the earth's atmosphere just over an hour later in its quest for the Ansari X Prize purse, aimed at spurring a new era of commercial space travel. Organisers of the so-far unique venture also confirmed Friday that the groundbreaking rocketship's pilot Mike Melvill successfully took the craft to 337,500 feet, or 103 kilometers (64 miles), on Wednesday's first flight. In order to win the prize, funded by a private organisation and aimed at mimicking the 1920s-era Orteig prize that aviator Charles Lindberg won when he crossed the Atlantic in 1927 and which kickstarted the age of commercial air travel, the craft had to break through the 328,000 foot barrier. In addition, space vehicles vying for the prize must send a manned, reusable spacecraft into space twice within two weeks, carrying the pilot and the equivalent weight of two passengers. There are 26 vehicles in contention for the Ansari prize, but SpaceShipOne, designed by pioneer aviator Burt Rutan, is far ahead of the others and is by far the favourite to win the prize. Designer Rutan said after Wednesday's dramatic flight that he and his team would examine flight data carefully to establish what caused the craft to corkscrew through the air dozens of times before it entered space to make sure there was no problem with the ship. Veteran South African test pilot Melvill conceded that the hair-raising incident might have been his fault and that he "must have stamped on something" he should not have as the rocket plane was flying at speeds of around 3,000 kilometers an hour. Like the last two SpaceShipOne sub-orbital flights, Monday's attempt to snatch the X Prize will take place at Mojave airport in the middle of the California desert. The name of the pilot for the next flight has not yet been announced, but Melvill, who in June became the world's first commercial astronaut when he took the craft into space for the first time, said it would not be him.]]></c>

"The US will continue to abide by all its ATC commitments," US delegate William Tigliani said. The end of the 40-year-old quota regime, which limited imports into industrialised countries, was designed primarily to boost trade by poor countries that built up their industry around textiles. China joined the agreement when it became a member of the WTO in 2002. But the world's most populous nation and industrial powerhouse was not a part of the deal when it was negotiated in the 1990s. Many of the countries that wanted quotas abolished are among those now protesting about the agreement's likely impact.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Tens of thousands of demonstrators are expected to converge on Amsterdam Saturday to protest austerity measures and reforms planned by the centre-right government. The national day of action is being organised by trade unions which are hoping that 100,000 people will take part, a huge number for the Netherlands where there is less of a tradition of street protest than in France or Germany. Discontent with government policies has been mounting for some weeks and has been manifested in a series of strikes and demonstrations. On September 20 Rotterdam, the world's busiest port, was brought to a standstill for a day and almost 50,000 demonstrators staged a march. On Monday public transport in Amsterdam was hit by a 24 hour strike. Trade unions have been angered by plans to make it harder to take earlier retirement and make the criteria for invalidity and unemployment benefit more rigorous. They are also protesting proposed reforms of health insurance and the influence of the government on collective bargaining agreements. An opinion poll for a radio station carried out in mid September found 60 percent of those replying were opposed to the reforms. The unions have said they will be calling on their members to bombard some ministers in the ruling coalition with text messages.]]></c>

A total of 57 percent of Germans oppose Turkish membership of the EU while 35 percent are for it, found the forsa institute poll for N24 television.

The EU report, to be officially released on Wednesday but already seen by AFP, says that Turkey has made significant reforms to prepare to one day join the EU, but that it still falls short in many key areas.

		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Friday called on Israel to use only "proportional force" in its ongoing military operations in Gaza and urged the Jewish state to avoid civilian Palestinian casualties which it said complicated Middle East peace efforts. As the White House did earlier, the State Department declined to condemn the massive raids and stressed that Israel had a right to defend itself but "noted with regret reports of civilian casualties" sustained in the operation. "We urge the government of Israel to take every measure to ensure that only proportional force is used to counter the threat that it faces," deputy spokesman Adam Ereli told reporters. "We urge Israel to avoid civilian casualties and minimize humanitarian consequences. "These kinds of casualties can only make all of our efforts to achieve a durable peace more difficult," Ereli said. At least 45 Palestinians have been killed over the past three days along with two Israeli soldiers and a Jewish woman settler in one of the bloodiest battles since the Palestinian uprising started four years ago. On Friday alone, a day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the army to step up a massive raid in Gaza to stop militant rocket attacks on Israel, seven Palestinians were killed. The large-scale offensive has sparked international concern with Russia calling on Israel to refrain from using "indiscriminate" force while urging the Palestinians not to resort to "terrorist acts against Israel." France said it was "deeply concerned" by the flare-up and that "recourse to violence is not a solution" for either sides. Shortly before Ereli spoke for the State Department, White House spokesman Scott McClellan cautioned Israel to "keep in mind the impact" of its Gaza operations on the peace process. "We've always said Israel has the right to defend itself, but it's also important to keep in mind the impact of those decisions," he told reporters. McClellan also called for a return to the internationally drawn "roadmap" to peace in the region and praised Sharon's call for dismantling all Israeli settlements in Gaza and some in the West Bank. The latest deaths brought the overall toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising to 4,400, including 3,376 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TAMPA, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democratic challenger John Kerry roared back onto the campaign trail Friday, mocking President George W. Bush's showing in their first debate as he shot for a comeback in the race for the White House. Kerry set off on a two-day swing through the crucial battleground state of Florida, as aides basked in what they declared a clear victory in the first critical debate at the University of Miami on Thursday. The veteran senator delivered another withering attack on Bush's stewardship of the Iraq war, claiming the president was obstinate in refusing to change course despite a worsening situation there and a mounting insurgency. "The president keeps trying to debate himself on that," Kerry said, stealing one of the lines Bush had used to lampoon his rival. "He keeps trying to say 'we don't want somebody who wants to leave, we don't want a wilter or a waverer.'" "Mr President, nobody is talking about leaving, nobody is talking about wilting and wavering, we are talking about winning and getting the job done right," Kerry told cheering supporters at the University of South Florida. Kerry's aides immediately tried to turn the tables on Bush, branding the president rambling and confused -- the same line of attack Republicans have used against the Democratic challenger. "They have been saying, 'look, Kerry's a flip-flopper -- we're the steady, strong leader,' then they (viewers) turn on the television and it's exactly the opposite," said senior Kerry advisor Mike McCurry. "Kerry's the one who looks strong and steady and concise. and the other guy was rambling and distracted, and criss-crossing back and forth on what he was trying to say." But aides downplayed expectations Kerry's performance would spark an immediate surge in the polls, saying only that the Massachusetts senator had just started to reintroduce himself to voters after a months-long Republican effort to wound him through negative advertising.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[European stock markets spiked higher Friday, buoyed by a solid opening on Wall Street where technology shares benefited from positive broker comment and news that PeopleSoft had fired its chief executive, leader of its takeover defense against Oracle. The London FTSE 100 index rose 1.94 percent to finish at 4,659.6 points, its highest level in more than two years, as a positive outlook from home loans provider Northern Rock lifted banking stocks. The Frankfurt DAX jumped 2.62 percent to 3,994.96 and the Paris CAC 40 index gained 2.46 percent to 3,640.61. The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading eurozone shares advanced 2.56 percent to 2,796.08 points. The euro stood at 1.2398 dollars. Over on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 108.4 points to 10,188.7, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 38.92 points at 1,935.76 at the time of the London market's close. A raft of benign economic data and positive broker comment in the technology sector spurred the major US indices higher. The ISM index fell to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 percent in August. The decline was in line with expectations. "Today's figures suggest that manufacturing activity remained healthy in September: industrial production is likely to register a significant rise over the month," said CDS Ixis economist Marie-Pierre Ripert in Paris. However, US consumer sentiment eroded more than expected in late September -- down to 94.2 from 95.8 earlier in the month, according to the University of Michigan. On a more positive note, construction spending in August rose by a better-than-expected 0.8 percent, the Commerce Department said. In London, Northern Rock jumped 3.52 percent to 735 pence after the British home loans provider forecast full-year profits at least in line with consensus. The positive outlook lifted sector peers, with HBOS winning 2.55 percent to 765 pence and Barclays 2.64 percent higher at 544 pence. In Frankfurt, SAP jumped 3.80 percent higher to 129.85 euros, as news that PeopleSoft has sacked its CEO rekindled merger hopes with Oracle and boosted the software sector. German chip maker Infineon gained 3.28 percent to 8.49 euros, after overnight Semiconductor Industry Association data showed a 34 percent rise in global chip sales in August, while Deutsche Telekom surged 4.08 percent to 15.55. Alcatel, up 4.68 percent at 9.85 euros in Paris, posted the strongest gains on the CAC-40. Elsewhere in Europe, the Swiss SMI rose 1.16 percent to 5,528.9 points. The Amsterdam AEX added 2.14 percent to 330.87, the Brussels Bel-20 gained 1.18 percent to 2,725.12, the Madrid Ibex-35 jumped 2.38 percent to 8,220.6 and the Milan Mib 30 climbed 1.85 percent to 28,473.0. Earlier in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei-225 index closed 1.49 percent higher at 10,985.17 points after the key Tankan survey showed continued improvement in business sentiment in the September quarter, dealers said. Hong Kong's market was closed for a public holiday.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Several hundred Chinese schoolchildren watched public sentencings for criminals who were later executed, Amnesty International said Friday. The criminals, convicted of murder, assault and kidnapping, were handed their death sentences in Changsha in central Hunan province, Amnesty said in a statement citing a Chinese Internet report. After the sentencing, the men were taken to an execution ground and shot, Amnesty said, quoting the 'tom' web portal. The schoolchildren were aged between six and 17 and were among the 2,500 people who watched the sentencing on September 27, the day of China's Mid-Autumn festival. "The Chinese government regularly 'celebrates' national holidays by executing large numbers of criminals," Amnesty's Asia director Ingrid Massage said. "This year, the Mid-Autumn festival falls in the same week as China's National Day on Friday 1 October and there has been a surge of executions." Amnesty said at least 100 people had been executed in China in recent days. China executes more people annually than the rest of the world combined, with Chinese academics estimating more than 10,000 executions a year.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US destroyers equipped with Aegis missile tracking systems have been deployed in the Sea of Japan near North Korea as part of a controversial new US missile defense system, the Navy's civilian chief said Friday. "We do have our Aegis destroyers deployed and indeed they do have tracking capability as we committed to do before the end of the year," Navy Secretary Gordon England told reporters. England confirmed reports that the destroyers were in the Sea of Japan near North Korea, whose long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs put it at the top of the US threat list. But he would not say whether it meant the missile defense system that the United States is erecting at bases in Alaska and California is now operational. Pentagon officials have said the United States is on track to declare the system's "initial defensive capability" this year, providing a limited defense against long range missile attack by a "rogue" state. Critics of the system, however, say there is little confidence the system will work because it has not been sufficiently tested. The Aegis destroyers' powerful radars would be used to track long-range missiles after they have been detected by early warning radars. Data from the radars flow to command centers where they are integrated with other targeting data to launch interceptor missiles into the path of the incoming missile. So far, the Pentagon hass in December 2002. However, a surrogate booster and radar were used in those and earlier tests. Thomas Christie, the Pentagon's chief of operational testing and evaluation of weapon systems, has warned they system may be only 20 percent effective. Retired general Eugene Habiger, former head of the US Strategic Command, recently decried the rush to field a system, saying it "does not have any credible capability." "I cannot recall any military system being deployed in such a manner," he said. "In my entire military experience, I have never seen a weapons system deployed with something as squishy, if you will, as an "initial defensive capability." Habiger also suggested the North Korean threat has been exagerated, saying it has not flight tested an intercontinental ballistic missile and must first overcome the formidable challenge of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead.]]></c>

The mission will replace the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) early next year. The EU plans to send 6,000 men in an operation codenamed Althea, which will be the biggest military operation undertaken by the 25-nation bloc. Its job will be to keep the peace between Bosnia's different communities -- Croats, Muslims and Serbs -- in accordance with the 1995 Dayton agreement.

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Friday strongly condemned a car bombing that wounded a Lebanese minister who recently resigned in a dispute over Syria's domination of the country, calling it a "vicious terrorist attack." "We strongly condemn the bombing attack this morning in Beirut against the former minister of economy and trade, Marwan Hamadeh," deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said. "We extend our sympathies to the victims of this vicious terrorist attack and we wish Mr. Hamadeh a speedy and full recovery," he told reporters, noting that the US ambassador to Lebanon, Jeffrey Feltman had visited Hamadeh in the hospital where he is recovering from his injuries. "We call on the Lebanese authorities to fully investigate this attack and to bring the perpetrators and their backers to justice quickly," Ereli said. Hamadeh's bodyguard was killed and his driver wounded in the blast near his home shortly before UN chief Kofi Annan accused Syria and its allies in Lebanon of failing to abide by UN Security Council demands for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. The bombing was described by many as an attack on Lebanon's democracy and observers noted that Hamadeh has been one of the most vocal opponents of continued Syrian political and security interference in Lebanon. Lebanese President Emile Lahoud ordered "police and judicial authorities to uncover the (truth) behind this act. which aimed at creating national discord," a statement said. Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, who has close ties with Hamadeh, also ordered "security officials. to promptly uncover those behind this odious crime that targets all honorable men". Hamadeh, whose mother in French, is one of four ministers who quit on September 6 to protest a controversial Syrian-inspired constitutional amendment that kept Lahoud, a Damascus protege, as head of state for another three years. That move came only a day after the UN Security Council made its latest demands in Resolution 1559 which was adopted by the bare minimum vote on September 2. On Wednesday, Syria wrapped up a limited troop pullout of about 3,000 soldiers, leaving about 15,000 troops on Lebanese soil, down from a peak of between 35,000 and 40,000 during the Lebanese civil war.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Copenhagen's futuristic new opera house, the largest in Scandinavia and one of the most modern in the world, was inaugurated on Friday ahead of opening to the public early next year. The glass-and-steel building, designed by the leading Danish architect Henning Larsen, is located on Copenhagen's port, in the axis of the Amalienborg royal palace. The 2.3-billion-kroner (309-million-euro, 383-million-dollar) construction costs were covered by the Danish business tycoon Maersk Mc-Kinney Moeller, chief shareholder of the A.P. Moeller-Maersk maritime and oil company. The 91-year-old businessman had offered in 1999 to build the opera house as a gift to the Danish state, which will cover its annual operating costs of around 140 million kroner. The opera, which took three years to complete and will also house the Copenhagen royal ballet, is set to open to the public on January 26 with a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's opera "Aida".]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Professional Cycling Council (CCP), one of the most influential decision-making bodies in the sport, announced Friday that the impending ProTour series would now include 20 and not 18 teams. The CCP's decision here at the world cycling road race championships follows a request by the International Association of Professional Cycling Teams (AIGCP) to increase the number of teams to 20 in 2005 instead of 2006, as was initially planned. It means the likes of Saeco, who on Friday announced that they would merge with the Lampre team for the ProTour, will be virtually assured of a place and other teams can aspire to join the Pro Tour. The ProTour, which is scheduled to be introduced in January 2005 by the International Cycling Union (UCI), is however being opposed by the organisers of the three major Tours of Italy, France and Spain. Negotiations are ongoing and UCI chiefs have insisted that the project, whose aim is to further unify the sport, will be introduced as planned whether the big race organisers participate or not. UCI chief Hein Verbruggen is set to hold a press conference on Saturday where he will outline the project for the ProTour, which was initially mooted as a 20-team elite league with a 22-race calendar.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GENEVA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Friday voiced its serious concern about the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip and in Israel, as one of the bloodiest battles since the Palestinian uprising started four years ago raged on. The ICRC said it was "deeply concerned by the effects of the violence which has raged in the Gaza Strip and in Israel in recent days" and was "alarmed by the escalation which has claimed the lives of several children and other civilians in the past 24 hours". At least 45 Palestinians have been killed over the past three days along with two Israeli soldiers and a Jewish woman settler in a massive Israeli incursion into the northern Gaza Strip. The Israeli campaign to stop militant rocket attacks on southern Israel, codenamed "Days of Penitence", intensified on Wednesday after two Israeli toddlers were killed by a rocket strike in Sderot, just across the Gaza Border. The ICRC called on all parties to "show restraint and to respect the principle of proportionnal action in all military operations". It also called on the parties to "instantly respect the rules and other principles of international humanitarian law under all circumstances". The Swiss government also voiced its concern in the face of the violence, calling on Israel to respect international humanitarian law, which forbids both the disproportionate use of force and retaliatory action against civilians. Government spokesman Alessandro Delprete strongly condemned the heavy civilian death toll resulting from Israeli military operations, while also condemning Palestinian militant attacks against Israeli civilians. Bern called on the Palestinian authority to do "all within its power" to stop militant attacks and to take "decisive steps" to dismantle extremist militant groups. The latest deaths have brought the overall toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising to 4,400, including 3,376 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush, Kerry step up attacks after debate.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TAMPA, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Both claiming victory in their first debate, US President George W. Bush and Democratic White House hopeful John Kerry clashed on Iraq Friday as they courted voters in key up-for-grabs states. Bush, in often harsher language than he used when he was face to face with Kerry, seized on his rival's comment that preemptive US military action ought to pass a "global test" to accuse him of putting worldwide popularity ahead of US security. "The president's job is not to take an international poll. The president's job is to defend America," the Republican incumbent said. "The use of troops to defend America must never be subject to a veto by countries like France." Aides to Kerry, off on a two-day swing through the crucial battleground state of Florida, countered that the president had taken the senator's comments out of context out of desperation. "If you rely on a half-sentence to attack your opponent, it's proof youre not telling the whole truth, youre distorting a debate you lost," said Kerry campaign spokesman David Wade. As tens of millions of Americans watched, Kerry said in Thursday's televised debate that he would not become the first president in US history to give up the right to launch preemptive military action to defend the United States. "But if and when you do it. you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons," he added. Kerry, who many said won the debate, also branded Bush's invasion of Iraq "a colossal error in judgment," assailed his post-war plan, and vowed to convene a summit to mobilize more help for stabilizing that war-torn country. "I've been to a lot of summits," Bush said derisively at a rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania Friday. "I've never seen a meeting that would depose a tyrant, or bring a terrorist to justice." Bush also courted voters in the up-for-grabs state of New Hampshire as he worked to preserve a steady lead in national polls and a thin edge in the undecided states that will decide the November 2 election. Kerry hoped to capitalize on solid reviews of his performance in the first of three debates to turn around what had been a flagging campaign, and aides exulted over instant polls suggesting the US public thought he had beaten Bush. A Gallup poll for CNN gave Kerry a 46 percent to 37 percent win over the president but the survey said Bush still had the support of 51 percent of voters against 47 percent for Kerry. Taking aim at Bush's charges that he would turn tail from Iraq, Kerry told supporters here: "Nobody's talking about wilting and wavering. We're talking about winning and getting the job done right."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Friday called on Israel to use "only proportional force" in its ongoing military operations in Gaza and urged the Jewish state to avoid civilian Palestinian casualties which it said complicated peace efforts. Washington declined to condemn its closest Middle East ally for the massive raids, in which at least 45 Palestinians have been killed, and stressed that Israel had a right to defend itself but "noted with regret reports of civilian casualties" sustained in the operation. "We urge the government of Israel to take every measure to ensure that only proportional force is used to counter the threats that it faces," deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli told reporters. "We urge Israel to avoid civilian casualties and minimize humanitarian consequences. "These kinds of casualties can only make all of our efforts to achieve a durable peace more difficult," he said. "It's understandable that if you're under attack by terrorists, you need to respond but that response should be gauged at the terrorists and it should not victimize innocents. All care should be taken to protect and respect civilian life and property," Ereli said. At least 45 Palestinians and five Israelis have been killed over the past three days in one of the bloodiest battles since the Palestinian uprising started four years ago. On Friday alone, a day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the army to step up a massive raid in Gaza to stop militant rocket attacks on Israel, seven Palestinians were killed. The latest deaths brought the overall toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising to 4,400, including 3,376 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count. The large-scale offensive has sparked international concern with Russia calling on Israel to refrain from using "indiscriminate" force while urging the Palestinians not to resort to "terrorist acts against Israel." France said it was "deeply concerned" by the flare-up and that "recourse to violence is not a solution" for either sides. Ereli's comments on behalf of the State Department were slightly stronger than earlier remarks from the White House which stopped short of even hinting at criticism of Israel and did not include the appeal for restraint. Speaking in Allentown, Pennsylvania where US President George W. Bush was campaigning ahead of November 2 elections, White House spokesman Scott McClellan cautioned Israel to "keep in mind the impact" of its Gaza operations on the peace process. "We've always said Israel has the right to defend itself, but it's also important to keep in mind the impact of those decisions," he told reporters. McClellan also called for a return to the internationally drawn "roadmap" to peace in the region and praised Sharon's call for dismantling all Israeli settlements in Gaza and some in the West Bank.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ALLENTOWN, Pennsylvania, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush charged Friday that Democratic White House hopeful John Kerry would let France or other countries decide when Washington can use force to defend itself. "The president's job is not to take an international poll. The president's job is to defend America," the president said a day after his first debate with Kerry, which many analysts said the Democrat won. Bush backers still fume that Paris led opposition to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, a move that led to boycotts of French products and the renaming of foods like "French fries" to "Freedom fries." "The use of troops to defend America must never be subject to a veto by countries like France," Bush told supporters a day after Kerry said the United States ought to pass a "global test" before launching a preemptive war. Kerry spokesman David Wade accused the president of taking Kerry's words out of context and brushed off the attack as a desperate ploy, saying: "They want to run against a straw man. Instead, they have to run against John Kerry." The Democratic senator from Massachusetts had vowed not to become the first president in US history to give up the right to launch preemptive military action to protect the United States. "But if and when you do it. you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons," said Kerry. "Senator Kerry, last night, said that America has to pass some sort of global test before we can use American troops to defend ourselves. He wants our national security decisions subject to the approval of a foreign government. "Listen, I'll continue to work with our allies and the international community, but I will never submit America's national security to an international test," Bush told the cheering crowd. "Anytime the Republicans are basing their attack on a half sentence taken out of context it means that even they know they are not telling the whole truth," said Wade. "It's evidence of how much their candidate is flailing and how much they want to try to distract from that. It's nonsense," he told AFP.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MILAN, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Dolce and Gabbana and Gianfranco Ferre both heard the call of the wild for next summer, filling their ready-to-wear collections shown here on Friday with real and fake animal skins from big cats to crocodile, python and kangaroo. At Dolce and Gabbana Naomi Campbell was first down the runway in a bustier dress in grey python, and with the exception of a couple of satin pants suits, all the models were dressed for the urban jungle at very least. Jeans had strips of white python running the length of the leg, and snakeskin adorned the cuffs of little jackets. A trench came entirely in python, while zebra and leopardskin prints for evening were glitzed up with diamante. The house's designers, who dedicated their diffusion line earlier in the week to Elvis Presley as fashion icon, had hoped to bring together star guests Priscilla, Lisa Marie and Riley Keough, respectively the widow, daughter and grand-daughter of the King, in the front row. But in the event they were caught up in traffic and the show had to start without them. At Ferre the safari theme dominated his evening wear, from the leopardskin jacket over tiger pants to a figure-hugging stretch zebra sheath which almost disappeared behind layers of pleated leopard spotted tulle. Liberty floral prints, heavily over-embroidered like haute couture, were thrown into the mix, with, for example, a zebra black and white bondage top. Ferocious sharks' teeth took the place of toggles on mini-duffle coats or in necklaces. More wearable were his sporty opening numbers, pants with low crotches rapper style, some a half-way house between tracksuit bottoms and jeans, and cropped leggings in oyster, taupe and grey jersey. Antonio Berardi's collection in contrast was a naughty-but-nice mix of medieval costume influences and retro-lingerie, all ruffles and flounces, floor-sweeping skirts, corsetry lacing and decollete necklines. Leg-of-mutton sleeves ballooned out from the shoulder but were drawn in at the elbow with ties or encircled with frills, giving a waffled effect. Bare-midriffs came veiled in a whisper of sheer chiffon, bosoms were given extra emphasis with bursts of sunray pleating. Swishy, slightly crumpled, skirts dipped towards the floor. Colours were for the boudoir -- rose pink, ivory, toffee, cafe latte, and pearly grey. What more appropriate bag than one shaped like a bra and trimmed with creamy lace. Twinkling crystal decorations could be properly appreciated in 3D with cardboard glasses provided. Berardi's models were given some posture practise from the headgear dreamt up by mad hatter Stephen Jones, who used piles of books for his creations: some open volumes, others heavy tomes, tilted at a perilous angle as if about to tumble. At the Moschino Cheap and Chic show, the audience was caught off guard when the first models to step onto the catwalk were -- three little white-haired grannies. The room burst into spontaneous applause. The grannies were clearly on their holidays, with cameras and traditional Hawaiian flower garlands slung round their necks, and wearing bold floral prints and gingham checks. It was refreshing to see the clothes on real figures, not the usual beanpole models. The collection followed through on the exotic travel theme, with low-slung hula hula skirts in rainbow strips of fabric, bright Hawaiian shirts, bermuda shorts, micro-mini sarongs and perky checked bikini tops. The garland idea was cleverly worked into necklines of frocks and blouses with delicate appliqued silk flowers. Straw sun hats, stylised daisy brooches and necklaces dangling with glazed pottery starfish and fish completed the picture.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Iraq officially took control of defending its coastal waters in the oil-rich south on Friday with the launch of the small Iraqi navy, the US-led military said. Formed in January, the 412-strong Iraqi Coastal Defence Force (ICDF) has been trained by British, Australian, US and Dutch troops. "Iraqis have taken responsibility for protecting territorial waters today, and actual work will begin tomorrow," Colonel Hameed Balafam, commander of the ICDF, said in a statement. The fledgling navy set sail at a ceremony to mark its launch in the southern port of Umm Qasr, which was attended by Iraqi and US-led military officials. It will be in charge of protecting a majority of the country's all-important oil exports which have been the target of a spate of devastating sabotage attacks in recent months, the statement said. "Our first mission will be to protect oil ports in Basra and Khor al-Amaya from saboteurs and infiltrators," said Balafam. "I'm fully confident because most of the Iraqi Coastal Defense Force personnel are from the former Iraqi navy and I'm confident about their skills."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An American judge has ordered the FBI to release its file on the late Beatle John Lennon who was targeted by US security services as a counterculture icon, a report said Friday. Under the order, made Tuesday by a US District Judge Robert Takasugi in Los Angeles, the Federal Bureau of Investigation must unseal the last 10 pages of the 300-page file that history professor Jon Wiener has fought a two-decade battle to access. The self-described "radical historian" from the University of California, Irvine, first sought access to the file two year after Lennon was gunned down outside his New York apartment in December 1980, the Los Angeles Times said. But the US government resisted Wiener's attempts to obtain the documents through the US Freedom of Information Act, sparking a long battle in which Wiener won a string of minor victories culminating in Tuesday's ruling. "The most interesting thing to me is that it shows how (former US president Nixon feared the political power of John Lennon, the political power of rock 'n' roll," Wiener told the Times. "It also shows the administration's abuse of power," he said referring to already-released parts of the dossier that showed that the FBI had sought to arrest Lennon on drug charges to ensure he was deported. One 1972 memo revealed that FBI officials, who conceded their case against the musician was "loose," sought to encourage his arrest at the Republican Convention in Miami that year "if at all possible on possession of narcotics charge." Lennon, who was vehemently opposed to the Vietnam war at the time, did not ultimately attend the political meeting. The US government said at the time that British-born Lennon was not being targeted for his political views, but the FBI filed appeared to contest that assertion. Immigration officials attempted to deport him from the United States in 1972 citing an earlier drug-related arrest in Britain. But Lennon successfully appealed the move and remained in the United States for the rest of his life.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices closed above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time in New York trading Friday, as traders fretted about Nigerian oil production amid a threatened rebel uprising. The New York Mercantile Exchange's light sweet crude November futures contract closed at 50.12 dollars a barrel, up 48 cents from Thursday's close. The crude market is nervous about any potential disruption to Nigerian oil production as the country exports much of its oil to the United States and is Africa's biggest exporter. "There are still concerns about Nigeria," said Refco oil analyst Marshall Steeves, referring to Friday's closing price spike. Unrest in Iraq has also driven prices up in recent weeks. Traders are holding their breath that the Nigerian government, in peace talks with rebels, will be able to stave off a threatened uprising by the rebels who said they would mount an all-out war on the government if their demands were not met. Asari's Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF) has threatened oil installations and asked foreign oil workers to quit the region, it's one of the militias fighting for supremacy over control of the west African country's illegal oil trafficking. The group claims to be fighting for the rights of the ethnic Ijaws living around the centre of Nigeria's Niger delta oil industry, which turns out about 2.3 million barrels per day.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Ukraine's central election commission on Friday tried to stamp out growing speculation about postponing or canceling the presidential election later this month in a move to keep President Leonid Kuchma in office. "Nobody could cancel the election. or recognize the results as invalid," said the chairman of Ukraine's central election commission, Serhiy Kivalov. "The election will take place no matter what the political climate," he told journalists. Ukrainian political analysts and opposition leaders have recently begun to speculate about the possibility of a cancelation or postponement of the October 31 election as a means to prevent the victory of the opposition candidate and keep Kuchma as president. Liberal opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko is leading in polls in which he is challenging Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, the pro-presidential parties' standard bearer to replace Kuchma. But analysts say some Ukrainian political heavyweights are not happy with Yanukovich and would prefer keeping in office Kuchma, who is stepping down after the consstation from the air, violence against activists, and allegations of a poisoning attempt on the life of Yushchenko. A recent survey showed Ukrainians are highly skeptical that the election will be honest, with nearly two-thirds saying they believe the results will be falsified.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US photographer Richard Avedon, who died at 81 in San Antonio, Texas, Friday after a brain hemorrhage, was an icon of fashion and celebity photography, internationally acclaimed for his stark trademark portraits of the famous and beautiful. Avedon was born in New York City in 1923, son of Russian-Jewish immigrants. He dropped out of high school during World War II to join the US Merchant Marine and later studied philosophy at Columbia University and photography at New York University's New School. As a staff photographer first for Harper's Bazaar and later for Vogue, he skyrocketed to fame for his hallmark celebrity photographs. Avedon possessed an inimitable talent for drawing out the elusive personal essence of his subjects, and was sought out by the world's most famous people for their portraits. It was said of Avedon that his ability to set his subjects at ease was the singular quality what allowed him to create his intimate and lasting portraits. His austere black and white photographs of Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot, Louis Armstrong and Alfred Hitchcock, of Andy Warhol, Jimmy Durante, Charlie Chaplain and hundreds of others, became legend. Avedon was visual consultant for the 1957 film "Funny Face," starring Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn, a film loosely based on his own career. Although his reknown was for portrait photography, Avedon won worldwide acclaim for his vivid documentation of the civil rights movement in the American South in 1963 and the anti-Vietnam war movement across America in 1969. Washington's Smithsonian Institution exhibited his work in 1962, as did New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978 and 2002. Numerous other museums and galleries in Europe and America have shown his photographs. In 1974, Avedon shocked New York with an exhibit at the city's Museum of Modern Art of photos of his own father ravaged by cancer. Avedon's books include Nothing Personal (1964), Portraits (1976), In the American West (1985), and Made in France (2001). For more than half a century, his portraits filled the pages of America's top magazines. In 1992 Avedon became The New Yorker magazine's first staff photographer, and he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[At least 100 dead as US, Iraqi troops storm rebel-held town.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[At least 100 people were killed and 180 wounded as US and Iraqi troops stormed the rebel-held city of Samarra Friday in a first effort to restore government control before promised elections, while a shocked nation buried 34 children killed by car bombs. In the United States, President George W. Bush and challenger John Kerry held their first debate before November 2 polls, with Kerry terming the invasion of Iraq "a colossal error" and Bush replying that "the world is better off without Saddam Hussein." Iraq's hostage crisis showed no let-up, with Jakarta confirming two nationals were among the 10 latest victims. Al-Jazeera television said the two were seized along with six Iraqis and two Lebanese working for an electrical equipment firm. A massive force of 3,000 US troops and 2,000 Iraqi auxiliaries poured into Samarra before dawn and seized the city hall and police stations in the largest joint operation since last year's invasion. The armoured assault came just a day after the US-backed interim government vowed to restore control over all insurgent enclaves in the restive Sunni Arab belt north and west of Baghdad by next month in readiness for nationwide polls promised for January. "In response to repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces (US military terminology for insurgents), Iraqi security forces and multinational forces secured the government and police buildings in Samarra," the US military said. A spokesman said 114 insurgents were killed for the loss of just one US soldier. Four more American troops were wounded. Samarra's main hospital received 90 dead and 180 wounded, said Dr Khaled Ahmed. There was intense fighting between troops and insurgents in the city centre around the gold-domed Imam Ali al-Hadi mausoleum, a revered Shiite Muslim shrine in the midst of this overhwelmingly Sunni Arab city of some 250,000 people. Smoke billowed into the sky as the two sides traded fire on the hallowed ground, but the Iraqi army's 36th Commando Battalion secured the area and there was no damage to the mausoleum, the military said. A Turkish hostage was freed by US troops in the city, it added. By midday (0900 GMT), US forces held the city hall and police stations, while Iraqi troops had won control of key heritage sites, including the renowned spiral minaret of the ninth century Al-Malwiya mosque on Samarra's outskirts. Iraqi forces captured 37 insurgents, said National Security Advisor Qassem Daoud. The massive offensive came despite mounting talk in recent days of an imminent deal between insurgents and Iraq's interim authorities for a peaceful restoration of government control. Only Thursday, provincial governor Hamed Hamud al-Qaissy said a deal was close and cautioned against any resort to force, saying it risked a new spiral of violence in the region. The leader of a Samarra political association also expressed dismay at the the offensive. "We were in talks with Prime Minister Iyad Allawi about the situation in Samarra, including reaching an agreement to allow Iraqi forces to enter the city. We were surprised by this military offensive," said Khaled Naji al-Samarrai. But on Friday night, Iraq's national security advisor insisted municipal, clerical and tribal leaders had asked the government to intervene at a meeting in Baghdad last Sunday. "They said frankly please come and help us," said Daoud. "Even if they didn't ask us, we would have still gone into the city." The government has come under mounting pressure to reassert control amid mounting expressions of doubt that credible nationwide elections can be held as planned in January amid an escalation of car bombings and other violence across the Sunni Arab belt, which fared relatively well under Saddam's Sunni-dominated regan unofficial French mediator acknowledged in Damascus that his bid to secure the release of two captive French newsmen had failed. "I was expecting the journalists to return today, but that hasn't happened for security reasons and because other people claiming to speak for the French government have said they could come up with large amounts of cash," said French MP Didier Julia. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin refused to be downcast, saying the information coming out of Iraq was "not complete" and that the government still had "a favourable outlook" about the prospects for a happy ending.]]></c>

The UN's emergency relief coordinator, Jan Egeland, asked for 32 million dollars for Haiti and 27 million dollars for Grenada in order to bring "life-saving humanitarian assistance" to the ravaged countries. "We need it yesterday," Egeland told reporters. "The situation is very bad." He said the money would be used for food, shelter, water, sanitation and medicine, and that only five million dollars had been received for each country so far. "Haiti is in a class of its own because of the enormous death toll," Egeland said. "So far it's at 1,500 confirmed dead (and) it is still rising -- 950 people are still missing. Most of them are presumed dead." In Grenada, he said, "The material damage is just unbelievable. The whole society has to be rebuilt."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Developing countries seek greater voice in IMF, World Bank leadership.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Developing countries chastized the IMF and the World Bank Friday for what they said had been a failure to give them greater decision-making power in the two institutions and urged that the next World Bank president be chosen regardless of nationality. The Group of 24 developing country ministers also said the US current account deficit drained vital funds away from poorer nations, describing the shortfall as "a misallocation of resources." Their statement came ahead of the annual meeting opening here Saturday of International Monetary Fund and World Bank policymakers. The ministers voiced their "strong disappointment and concern that, after two and a half years, no progress has been made on the issues of increasing basic votes and revising the quotas of developing countries in the IMF." They warned that "the current under-representation of developing countries in the decision-making process undermines the credibility and legitimacy (of the fund and the bank) and puts their relevance into question." A country's voting power, as well as its financial commitment, in the IMF is determined by its economic position relative to other members. While quota calculations have recently been updated, according to the G24 statement, they "continue to understate the role of developing countries in the world economy." Demands by the developing world for greater clout within the IMF and the World Bank are likely to intensify next June when the current term of World Bank President James Wolfensohn comes to an end. The G24 ministers said that if Wolfensohn does not seek another five-year term, there should be "a transparent selection process (to choose a successor), with a view to attracting the best candidates regardless of nationality." By tradition, the head of the World Bank is reserved for an American while the job of IMF managing director goes to a European. Elsewhere in their statement the ministers described the US current account deficit, a broad measure of foreign trade, as "a serious short- and medium-term challenge for the international economy." The shortfall is largely financed by foreign capital inflows into the United States, which according to G24 amounts to a diversion of "a substantial portion" of world savings away from the developing world. The ministers in addition expressed concern over continuing violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and the construction by Israel of a wall in the West Bank, which they said harmed the social and economic interests of the Palestinians. They appealed to the IMF and the bank therefore to increase their assistance to the Palestinian people.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Russian authorities have arrested 11 members of the outlawed Hizbi Tahrir radical Islamist group in possession of grenades, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported on Friday quoting the FSB secret services. The suspected militants were arrested in the city of Nizhny-Novgorod, 400 kilometres (240 miles) east of Moscow, in a joint operation between police and the secret services, the report said. All men, aged above 25, worked as traders in several markets in the city. They included several foreign nationals who all held valid residency papers, the report added. The suspects were found in possession of "combat grenades, audio and video material as well as handwritten and printed pamphlets," according to regional FSB officials quoted in the report. An investigation has been opened into "terrorist activities". The Hizbi Tahrir, a Sunnite movement founded in the Middle East in the 1950s, established itself in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia 10 years ago and reportedly wants to create an Islamic state in the region. Russia's Supreme Court classified the group as a "terrorist" organisation in February 2003. Ten militants from the group were arrested in June in the towns of Tyumen and Tobolsk in Siberia. Hizbi Tahrir, or the Party of Islamic Liberation, counts thousands of supporters in Russia, as well as in Uzbekistan, and neighbouring Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan where it is also outlawed. Uzbekistan accused the group of trying to overthrow the regime. Rights groups say more than 4,000 Hizbi Tahrir members are in Uzbek prisons serving sentences of up to 20 years. Rights groups have repeatedly accused Russian authorities of persecuting members of the group under the guise of fighting terrorism.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[American photographer Richard Avedon, renowned for his fashion work and minimalist black and white portraits of 20th century icons such as Marylin Monroe and Charlie Chaplin, died Friday at the age of 81, the New Yorker magazine announced. New Yorker spokeswoman Perri Dorset said that Avedon died in the Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, Texas where he suffered a brain hemorrhage last month while on a photo shoot for the magazine. Avedon had been taking pictures for several months across the United States for a commission titled "On Democracy". His most recent work published by New Yorker was of Italian artist Maurizio Catalan and before that Teresa Heinz-Kerry, the wife of Democratic presidential challenger John Kerry. But Avedon has long been one of the giants of international photography with his signature stark black and white portraits of models, actors and musicians. Born in New York in 1923, Avedon dropped out of high school and joined the Merchant Marine where he was put in the photographic section. Upon his return in 1944, he became a photographer in a department store but within two years had won over Harper's Bazaar and was working for that fashion magazine as well as Vogue. Increasingly, portraits became his main passion and he earned a reputation with his ability to to present the personal views and emotions of public figures. Monroe, Chaplin, Brigitte Bardot, Jean Renoir, President Dwight Eisenhower all posed for Avedon. Many stars asked Avedon to take their images for public consumption. In 1957, Hollywood paid tribute to him through the musical comedy, "Funny Face", which starred Fred Astaire as a fashionable photographer inspired by Avedon, and Audrey Hepburn. In 1959 he worked with Truman Capote on a book, "Observations", on some of the most famous and important people of the century. It included pictures of Buster Keaton, Gloria Vanderbilt, Pablo Picasso, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Mae West. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Avedon worked for Vogue magazine, taking some of the most famous portraits of the times. In 1992 he became the first staff photographer for the New Yorker, and two years later the Whitney Museum brought together fifty years of his work in the retrospective, "Richard Avedon: Evidence". In 2003 the Metropolitan Museum held its own retrospective, "Richard Avedon: Portraits".]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A Palestinian was killed and seven wounded Friday evening by an Israeli tank shell fired on the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, witnesses and Palestinian medics said. The dead man was named as Ibrahim Abu al Qusman, 21, and brings to 46 the number of Palestinians killed in a massive Israeli incursion into the northern Gaza Strip launched on Tuesday and sharply intensified Wednesday night. The attack came as Washington called on Israel to use only "proportional force" in its ongoing military operations in Gaza and to avoid civilian casualties which it said complicated Middle East peace efforts. Earlier, two Israeli soldiers were lightly wounded by an explosive device in the Jabliya camp, the Israeli military said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The UN Security Council voted on Friday to send almost 6,000 more peacekeeping troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, less than half the number the United Nations had asked for. The council unanimously passed a resolution to expand the force in the vast central African nation by 5,900 personnel, including up to 341 civilian police. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan had asked for an increase of 13,100. The United States, Britain and France -- three of the five permanent powers on the council -- reached a compromise this week on the number after weeks of negotiations. The United States pays 27 percent of all UN peacekeeping costs. But the United States has not been alone in expressing concerns about the mounting challenges of UN peace operations, with cost an issue as much as the difficulty in finding nations willing to commit troops. Annan has acknowledged that the success in resolving armed conflicts worldwide has increased demands on a global UN peacekeeping operation that is nearing the record deployment levels of the 1990s. The resolution, adopted 15-0, also extended the mandate of the UN force in the DRC until the end of March.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Friday welcomed Sudan's decision to accept a larger African Union force in its troubled western region of Darfur and urged the speedy deployment of AU troops. The State Department reaffirmed that Washington, which has already contributed 6.8 million dollars for logistical support for the existing deployment of AU monitors and another 20.6 million for other support, was prepared to further assist with the enlargment of the force. "We certainly welcome (Sudanese officials') comments that the government of Sudan has agreed to an African Union request for an expanded mission in Darfur," deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said. "We think it's important that more troops get there quickly," he told reporters. "We are working with all the parties to help the African Union rapidly deploy the expanded monitoring and protection force." Earlier Friday, the AU confirmed that Sudan's government has "formally accepted the reinforcement of the AU force" in Darfur, the western region in the grip of civil war, but said that no formal accord on the matter had been signed. The AU currently has some 300 soldiers in Darfur, whose task is to protect some 150 observers monitoring a ceasefire reached in April between Khartoum and Darfur rebel groups. The size and new mandate of the AU force is expected to be determined at a meeting of the pan-African Peace and Security Council in mid-October. Both the warring sides in Darfur, where, according to UN estimates, 50,000 people have died and 1.4 million been displaced since war broke out in February 2003, have accused the other of repeatedly violating the April truce. The United States has determined that a "genocide" is occuring in Darfur, where Khartoum's proxy Arab militia, the Janjaweed, is fighting indigenous black African rebel groups and accused of waging an massive ethnic cleansing campaign.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The American Civil Liberties Union, the leading US civil rights group, on Friday petitioned the US Supreme Court to rule on the right of homosexuals to adopt children. The case is an appeal to a split decision of a lower federal appeals court upholding a Florida law that excludes gay men and lesbians from consideration in adoptions. "Florida excluded gay people - and only gay people -- from its system for evaluating adoptive parents for one reason: to punish gay people," said Matt Coles, director of the ACLUs Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. "More than once, the Supreme Court has said that wont fly," he said in a statement. "For the sake of the many children in Florida who are without families and for the many lesbian and gay people willing to give them homes, we hope the court will take the case and declare once and for all that this law is unconstitutional." In its petition, the ACLU urges the high court to take the case because lower courts have refused to follow the courts warnings in two earlier cases that states are prohibited from adopting laws designed to disadvantage gay people. The Florida legislature passed the law at issue during an infamous anti-gay crusade in the 1970s by singer and Miss America runnerup Anita Bryant, who condemned homosexuality as immoral and against Gods wishes. Bryant's organization, Save Our Children, claimed gays needed to convert children to homosexuality because they themselves could not procreate. The Supreme Court petition "has important implications for Florida families and gay people across the country - but especially the children languishing in our states troubled foster care system," said Howard Simon, ACLU executive director in Florida. "We now must turn to the US Supreme Court to protect children and families from the ugly prejudices of politicians against gay people that have been disguised as legitimate public policy." Ironically, said the ACLU, while Florida bans homosexuals from adopting children, it regularly turns to them to serve as foster parents for orphans and children abandoned or removed from their homes by the courts. The Supreme Court is expected to decide by the end of the year whether to hear the Florida case.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEATTLE, Washington, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A plume of steam and ash erupted Friday from Mount St. Helens, the volcano that devastated swathes of the US northwest when it erupted 24 years ago, witnesses and geologists said. "The mountain began erupting some steam (around 12:15 am (1915 GMT))," said Mount St. Helens park ranger Greg Pohl after a colleague first spotted the plume. "At the moment it looks like a very small event and there is an ash pall that appears to be very small that seems to be heading in a westerly direction." Following the initial eruption, the volcano appeared to die down and the ash and steam clouded drifted off. The steam cloud poured from the southern edge of a 300-meter tall (1,000-foot-tall) lava dome in the volcano's crater that has risen in recent days, scientists said. "This is exactly the kind of event we've been predicting," US Geological Survey scientist Cynthia Gardner told KOMO Radio news. Officials notified aviation authorities to warn aircraft in the area of the steam and ash cloud, but said they did not believe there was any real danger to people who live in the region. Seismologists at the US Geological Survey have been warning of a possible imminent eruption following more than a week of growing earthquake activity in the area. A swarm of quakes began around the active volcano on September 24 and rose in magnitude through the week until they measured between 3.0 and 3.2 and were taking place four times a minute by Thursday. But, the scientists stressed, any explosion of the peak would not be as serious as the deadly 1980 explosion that killed 57 people and covered much of the northwestern US region in a thick blanket of ash.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Niger Delta rebels sign ceasefire, disarmament deal: officials (ADDS details, background).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ABUJA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two rival militias in Nigeria's Niger Delta, where unrest sent world oil prices soaring this week, promised Friday they would stop fighting government forces and hand in their weapons, a statement from the Nigerian presidency said Friday. "The groups affirm commitment to the peace offer by the president, promise to cease all hostilities against themselves and all economic and social interests of the Nigerian state," the statement said. The rebels threatened earlier this week to go to war if their demands for a bigger slice of Nigeria's oil wealth, greater autonomy for their Ijaw people, and a national debate on Nigeria's problems were not met. Mujahid Dokubo Asari, leader of the People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), began talks Wednesday with officials in President Olusegun Obasanjo's government ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to quit the Niger Delta. Asari and Ateke Tom, leader of the rival militia Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV), both signed the ceasefire deal, in which they promise "the disbandment of all militias and militant groups as well as total disarmament," according to the statement from the presidency. Fighting between the military and militias in the Niger Delta, which has been going on for more than a year, intensified in recent months. Rights groups say that at least 500 people died from the conflict there in August. The unrest and war rumblings in the Delta region helped send oil prices on an upward spiral which saw them burst through the 50-dollar-a-barrel barrier on Tuesday, but drop back below the crucial mark when the peace talks began. They closed above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time in New York trading Friday, as traders fretted about Nigerian oil production amid the threatened rebel uprising. The Niger Delta accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's crude output of 2.3 million barrels per day. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, derives more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange earnings from oil.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Darleen Druyun, a former Air Force official charged in a deal that allowed her to get a job with Boeing after overseeing a controversial lease of tanker planes, was sentenced Friday to nine months in prison, officials said. Druyun, 56, had pleaded guilty earlier this year to a criminal conspiracy charge for her role in the deal that gave her a lucrative job with the aerospace company after she pressed for a lease agreement on refueling aircraft. A spokeswoman for the US Attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia, said Druyun's sentence also calls for seven months' community confinement after her release from prison, three years' probation, 150 hours of community service and a 5,000-dollar fine. "Darleen Druyun owed her primary allegiance to the American taxpayer. Instead she put her own personal interests ahead of the United States Air Force," US Attorid it would be more economical to purchase aircraft. In May, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put the plan on hold until further studies are completed in November. A Pentagon advisory board recently concluded there is no compelling material or financial reason to replace the Air Force's refueling jets. Some critics of the deal said the program should be reopened to allow Europe's Airbus, which lost out for the contract, to submit another bid.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A French MP said here Friday that his unofficial bid to secure the release of two French journalists held in Iraq had failed after US troops opened fire on the convoy attempting to bring them out, killing six of their escorts. Didier Julia, an MP for President Jacques Chirac's ruling party, said that his assistant Philippe Brett had persuaded the kidnapppers to release reporters Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot and they had left in two separate convoys from their place of detention, both of which had come under US fire. "They set up 20 roadblocks and. six members of the team protecting the journalists were killed," said Julia, whose mission enjoys no backing from the French foreign ministry. The MP said Brett had learnt of the failure of the mission as soon as he arrived separately at the Syrian border and headed straight back to the journalists' captors. "The three Frenchmen are still in Iraq in the hands of the resistance," he said. "The Americans increased their bombardment and deployed two divisions to fire upon all terrorists who pass." Julia, 70, is vice president of the Iraqi-French Friendship Group. The two journalists have been held hostage by the Islamic Amry of Iraq since August 20.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Wall Street rallied Friday on mostly upbeat economic news, with the technology sector lifted by a shakeup at PeopleSoft that boosted expectations for a high-profile merger. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 112.38 points (1.11 percent) to 10,192.65 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite leapt 45.36 points (2.39 percent) to 1,942.20 at the closing bell. Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak said Wall Street opened on an upbeat note, lifted by overseas markets after a strong reading of the closely-followed Tankan business sentiment survey in Japan. There is also "optimism that now that we are actually going to get third quarter earnings as opposed to just pre-announcements, that maybe it won't be as bad as the pre-announcements implied," said Boockvar. The market shrugged off a surge in oil prices, with the New York contract closing above 50 dollars for the first time. The tech sector was leading after key upgrades and news that PeopleSoft dumped chief executive Craig Conway, possibly clearing the way for a takeover by Oracle, and further consolidation. On the economic front, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in slightly below expectations at 94.2 from 95.8 earlier in the month. But construction spending rose by a better-than-expected 0.8 percent in August. And the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, while falling to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 percent in August, still showed strong growth. "You can't have a strong manufacturing sector without decent underlying economic fundamentals," said Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Silicon Valley dogfight between Oracle and PeopleSoft took a new turn Friday as PeopleSoft dumped the chief executive leading its takeover defense, and US regulators dropped their antitrust case. PeopleSoft said it was terminating president and chief executive Craig Conway, who has led the fight against a 7.7 billion dollar hostile takeover effort from rival Oracle. The company said its board voted to appoint Dave Duffield, the company founder and chairman, as CEO, and announced the appointment of two co-presidents. "These appointments followed the board's decision to terminate Craig Conway as president and CEO of the company, effective immediately," the PeopleSoft statement said. "The board said its decision resulted from a loss of confidence in Mr. Conway's ability to continue to lead the company." Meanwhile the Justice Department's top antitrust official said the government would not appeal a court decision allowing Oracle to pursue its takeover bid. US antitrust regulators had sought to block the bid, claiming it would hinder competition, but US District Judge Vaughn Walker rejected the government's arguments on September 9. "While we disagree with the district court's disappointing decision, we respect the role of the courts in the United States merger review process," said R. Hewitt Pate, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "Similarly, while we disagree with some of the legal observations in the district court's opinion, the ultimate outcome rested on detailed factual findings that would appropriately receive great deference in the appellate process." The Justice Department had argued that Oracle, PeopleSoft and Germany's SAP are the only companies that develop and sell the high-end integrated human resource and financial management software used by big companies and government agencies. Oracle bucked convention and court odds in defending itself against the suit. Typically corporations give up on takeover efforts if Justice Department lawyers deem they would be anti-competitive. "We are pleased that the Department of Justice has elected not to proceed with an appeal," said Oracle chairman Jeffrey Henley. "This affirms our longstanding belief that the transaction is not anti-competitive. We are now looking forward to the trial in Delaware of our claims against the PeopleSoft board of directors for their actions over the past year which have seriously damaged, and continue to damage, shareholder value."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The UN Security Council voted on Friday to send almost 6,000 more peacekeeping troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), less than half the number UN chief Kofi Annan had asked for. The council unanimously passed a resolution to expand the DRC force by 5,900 personnel, including up to 341 civilian police, raising the ceiling of the force, known as MONUC, to 16,700. Annan had requested an increase of 13,100 troops for in the vast central African nation, and told the council after the vote that he was sticking by his original request. "A newly approved ceiling of 16,700 in total falls well below the 23,900 troops and 507 civilian police personnel that I had recommended," he said, calling his figure "the minimum required to effectively meet the current challenges in the DRC." He added: "I sincerely hope that the council will favourably revisit the issue of MONUC's requirements in the future." But US envoy Stuart Holliday fired back that the resolution had provided for "an increase in the capacity appropriate to MONUC's current needs as well as to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo." The United States, Britain and France -- three of the five permanent powers on the council -- reached a compromise this week on the number after weeks of negotiations. The United States pays 27 percent of all UN peacekeeping costs.

The resolution, adopted 15-0, also extended the mandate of the UN force in the DRC until the end of March 2005. The DRC is struggling to rebuild from five years of civil war that left nearly three million dead, most from disease. The resolution would send most of the new soldiers into the DRC's volatile eastern region near the borders with Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The restive region, awash in the natural resources that have given rise to hopes of a successful national rebuilding, continues to be wracked by factional violence despite the end of the DRC's civil war.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices closed above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time in New York trading Friday, as traders fretted about Nigerian oil production amid a threatened rebel uprising. The New York Mercantile Exchange's light sweet crude November futures contract closed at 50.12 dollars a barrel, up 48 cents from Thursday's close. The crude market is nervous about any potential disruption to Nigerian oil production as the country exports much of its oil to the United States and is Africa's biggest exporter. "There are still concerns about Nigeria," said Refco oil analyst Marshall Steeves, referring to Friday's closing price spike. Unrest in Iraq has also driven prices up in recent weeks. Traders are holding their breath that the Nigerian government, in peace talks with rebels, will be able to stave off a threatened uprising by the rebels who said they would mount an all-out war on the government if their demands were not met. Asari's Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force has threatened oil installations and asked foreign oil workers to quit the region, it's one of the militias fighting for supremacy over control of the west African country's illegal oil traffic. The group claims to be fighting for the rights of the ethnic Ijaws living around the centre of Nigeria's Niger delta oil industry, which turns out about 2.3 million barrels per day. However, just after the New York market closed, two other militias in the delta, the People's Volunteer Force and the Niger Delta Vigilante, reportedly promised they would stop fighting government forces and hand in their weapons. "The groups affirm commitment to the peace offer by the president, promise to cease all hostilities against themselves and all economic and social interests of the Nigerian state," according to a statement issued by the Nigerian presidency Friday. Fighting between the military and militias in the Niger Delta, which has been going on for more than a year, has intensified in recent months. Oil prices have also spiked on the New York market recently in the wake of several hurricanes which have affected oil output in the Gulf of Mexico and tightened US domestic stocks.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Friday he has asked many of his foreign minister colleagues to back New York City's bid to host the 2012 summer Olympic Games and moved to allay concerns that tighter US immigration procedures may hurt attendance. Powell, a New York native, said he had also recorded a videotape on behalf of the bid which will make the same case, describing the city as "a place where you can come and have a good time" that would make a "great" host for the games. "I have already taped a promotional for the New York City bid," he told reporters at a news conference in Atlanta, Georgia which hosted the 1996 games. "I have written letters to my various foreign minister colleagues in various parts of the world saying that New York is a great town." "I've told them we know how to do an Olympics in the United States of America. Atlanta has certainly proven that as has Salt Lake and I hope New York will win the Olympic bid," Powell said. "They'll put on a great Olympics." New York is one five cities bidding to host the 2012 Olympics along with London, Madrid, Moscow and Paris. Each has until November 15 to turn in their bid reports to the International Olympic Committee, members of which will visit the competing cities in February and March. The IOC selection committee will then draw up a report on the candidates that will be made public a month before the winner is named on July 6, 2005 in Singapore. Concern has been expressed in some quarters that moves to tighten US border security in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, including tougher requirements for visa applicants, might hurt New York's bid. The US tourism industry, universities and other institutions have complained that lengthy visa process and enhanced immigration procedures are deterring potential foreign visitors from coming to the United States and there are fears that could spread to Olympic athletes and spectators. Powell allowed that there were some problems with the new restrictions but vowed they would be cleared up soon and pose no problem for the New York bid. "You will be welcomed in America, you will be welcomed to New York City," he said to would-be Olympians and sports fans. "We're working hard to get on top of (the problems), to improve our system and make is easy to get a visa but to make sure we know who got the visa." "We want a secure border and we want open doors and that's going to be the case in New York City. We want New York to be secure and we want people coming to New York to be secure and safe, so come to New York and enjoy yourself."]]></c>

The operation will not keep Watson from playing in this weekend's Champions Tour event here, although he has been feeling pain much of the season. Watson will have arthroscopic left hip surgery Tuesday at New England Baptist Hospital and later in the year Watson plans surgery on his right shoulder. "If I didn't play golf, I wouldn't be doing these surgeries now," Watson said. "I intend to play four or five more years out here, and I'd like to play without pain. I'm buying time, I know." Eight-time major winner Watson has played 11 seniors tournaments, earning 435,203 dollars with four top-10 finishes. In five starts since June, Watson's best finish was a tie for 22nd in the Senior British Open.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Arab League condemned Friday the Israeli military's latest operation in Gaza, saying it would only lead to more bloodshed, the official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported. The agency quoted League spokesman Hossam Zaki as saying "these Israeli crimes will only lead to more bloodshed in the region and instability." The League also criticized the Middle East peace quartet of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia for not speaking out against the Israeli operation, calling on the UN Security Council "to exercise its responsibility in maintaining peace and security". Seven Palestinians were killed in fighting in the northern Gaza Strip Friday, a day after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the army to step up a massive raid aimed at stopping militant rocket attacks on southern Israel. At least 45 Palestinians and five Israelis have been killed since the operation began on Tuesday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGALORE, India, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[India coach John Wright believes his side can bounce back from their recent dismal one-day form and give Australia a mighty shock in the forthcoming Test series. India were knocked out of the Champions Trophy by old rivals Pakistan in England last month at the semi-final stage, but Wright says the limited overs setback will have no bearing on the four-match Test series which starts here on Wednesday. "Now we're back to Test cricket and we've played some very good Test cricket over the last two series," said Wright after a 15-man India squad was named Friday. "Sometimes it's difficult to get momentum going in one-dayers and most of the boys are really looking forward to getting into Test mode. I've never had any doubts about this side. I've always had huge trust and enormous belief in their ability." India have been bolstered by the return of Sachin Tendulkar who has recovered from an elbow injury while Mohammad Kaif and Murali Kartik were also named in the squad for the first Two tests. Not surpisingly, Sourav Ganguly was named captain for the whole series. Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar were the three fast bowlers names which meant Ashish Nehra was left out. "Ashish has done well in one-dayers, but the fact that Ajit has such a good record against Australia went in his favour."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TORONTO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Embattled media baron Conrad Black announced Friday plans to file a 1.1-billion-dollar (869 million US) defamation lawsuit against Hollinger International's special committee over a report accusing Black of "looting" the Chicago-based newspaper company. The lawsuit would be the latest in a string of legal battles between Black, a Briton of Canadian origin, and Hollinger International, which dumped him as chief executive and removed him from the board of directors in January 2004. The special committee that drafted the report denouncing the alleged financial misdeeds has been notified, under the Libel and Slander Act of Ontario, of Black's "intention to institute an imminent lawsuit for defamatory statements about him, throughout the Committee's recently published report," Black's office said in a statement. "Mr. Black will accordingly exercise his rights under Canadian law to sue the defendants for one billion Canadian dollars plus punitive and exemplary damages of 100 million Canadian dollars," the statement said. The other defendents named were the committee's counsel and Hollinger's vice president for investor relations and corporate development. The report, submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a US federal court in August, accuses Black and his allies of "aggressive looting" of Hollinger International of more than 400 million dollars. Black maintains a 68 percent voting share and 18.2 percent equity holding in the rebellious US-based media company. Hollinger International, which owns the Chicago Sun-Times and the Jerusalem Post, sold its most precious property, Britain's Telegraph newspaper group, in July over Black's opposition. Black's office denounced the Hollinger committee's report, saying directors authorized payments made to the British lord. "A credulous reader would be unaware that payments to Mr. Black that are complained of in the report were justifiable and were authorized and disclosed by sophisticated and fully informed independent directors," Black's statement said. "Such a reader also would be unaware of the transformation, by Mr. Black and his associates, of many newspaper properties from struggling titles into flourishing and valuable properties, and of the resulting creation of more than 1 billion US dollars of value for the shareholders in barely ten years," it said. Among the many lawsuits in the dispute, Hollinger International is suing Black for 1.25 billion dollars, accusing him of taking improper payments and failing in his fiduciary duties to shareholders. Black is also seeking 10 million dollars in unpaid fees for management services and 300 million dollars in damages for alleged wrongful termination.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A French lawmaker said here Friday that his unofficial bid to secure the release of two French journalists held in Iraq had failed after US troops opened fire on the convoy attempting to bring them out, killing six of their escorts. Didier Julia, an lawmaker for President Jacques Chirac's ruling party, said that his assistant Philippe Brett had persuaded the kidnapppers to release reporters Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot and they had left in two separate convoys from their place of detention, both of which had come under US fire. "They set up 20 roadblocks and. six members of the team protecting the journalists were killed," said Julia, whose mission enjoys no backing from the French foreign ministry. He said Brett had learnt of the failure of the mission as soon as he arrived separately at the Syrian border and headed straight back to the journalists' captors. "The three Frenchmen are still in Iraq in the hands of the resistance," he said. "The Americans increased their bombardment and deployed two divisions to fire upon all terrorists who pass." It was not immediately clear when the incident occurred but it was believed to have happened in recent days. The US military in Baghdad rejected Julia's accusations. "I'd say that none of that is true. I have not seen any reports that would indicate any of these stories showing up are accurate or true," said senior spokesman Rear Admiral Greg Slavonic. Julia, 70, is vice president of the Iraqi-French Friendship Group. The two journalists have been held hostage by the Islamic Amry of Iraq since August 20.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Darfur violence is "demographic catastrophe": study.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The only detailed study into the toll from the violence in Sudan's Darfur region says fleeing families continued to suffer grievous losses after they arrived in displacement camps, and the bloodshed amounts to "a demographic catastrophe." The research established there were extremely high death rates among families who had fled their homes in West Darfur -- and the mortality remained very high after they had arrived in displacement camps, leaving many households bereft of adult males. Before displacement, the death rate was between six and 9.5 per day per 10,000 people, it found. Violence accounted for between 68-93 percent of deaths, with males aged over 15 the biggest number of casualties. They were between 29 and 117 times likelier to be killed than women or children. After displacement, the death rates remained extremely high, being between three and 10 times higher than the comparative rate elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, the study found. The highest known death rate in the four sites where the research was carried out was in the region of El Geneina, with 5.6 deaths per day per 10,000 people. According to the United Nations, some 50,000 people have been killed and 1.4 million driven from their homes in the 19-month conflict that began when rebels rose up against Khartoum to demand an end to alleged marginalization of their region -- populated mainly by black Africans. Sudanese army troops and a pro-government Arab militia, the Janjaweed, have led an anti-rebel offensive. They have been blamed by villagers for carrying out murder, rape, kidnapping, looting and burning. The European Parliament, German Defence Minister Peter Struck and US Secretary of State Colin Powell, among others, have described these attacks as genocide. "Our findings do not in themselves substantiate claims that events in Darfur amount to genocide, not least because this would require demonstration of such an intent on the part of the perpetrators, which is clearly beyond the scope of an epidemiological survey," the study says. "Nevertheless, we believe that, in the four sites we surveyed, high mortality and family separations amount to a demographic catastrophe." The study, published online on Thursday by the British journal The Lancet, was led by Evelyn Depoortere of the French medical survey group Epicentre, and include experts from the humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF, Doctors without Borders). It comprised interviews that were carried out between April and June 2004 among 3,175 sampled families. These families were among 215,000 internally displaced people at four sites in West Darfur -- Zalingei, Murnei, Niertiti and El Geneina. Respondents were asked to detail family losses, giving the age of the person who had died, the location and date when it had occurred and the cause of death. It is almost unique for a study like this to be carried out in a combat zone -- the authors discreetly say it was "done in a difficult setting" -- and the data is precious because it is scientific rather than anecdotal or skewed by conflict loyalties. That can be vital for bringing killers to justice, US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) refugee specialists Bradley Woodruff and Reinhard Kaiser said. "Rigorous epidemiological methods can be provide essential data to document potential violations of international humanitarian law," they said in a commentary also published by The Lancet.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[More than 600 former soldiers fail to report for duty: army.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[More than 600 former soldiers who were mobilized in July from a rarely tapped pool of reservists have failed to report for duty, and hundreds more have asked for delays or exemptions from the call-up, senior army officials said Friday. So far no one has been declared "absent without leave" for failing to report for duty, and the army still expects to meet the goal of a call-up in July of the army's Individual Ready Reserve officials said. But the response reflects the pervasive strains the army faces as it strives to keep combat units manned and ready for duty in Iraq and AFghanistan. In calling up the Individual Ready Reserve, the army is turning to former soldiers who left the service with no expectation of being recalled to active duty except in a national emergency. The last time the IRR was called up was in the 1991 Gulf War. Many were suprised by the army's decision to mobilize 5,674 former soldiers from the IRR to fill vacancies in combat units deploying to Iraq or Afghanistan. The army itself assumed that only about 4,400 of those would actually be put on active duty, with the remainder washing out because of medical conditions or other circumstances. Brigadier General Sean Byrne, the army's director of personnel policy, told reporters the army still expects to meet that goal. "About a third of them for one reason or another will be exempted, I think the 4,400 number is probably pretty solid, but as I said we're going into new territory," he said. But Byrne acknowledged that the army is watching the mobilization figures closely, and going to extra lengths to contact former soldiers who had failed to report for duty to discuss their situation. He said 622 soldiers ordered to report for duty since August 31 have failed to do so. Of those, 375 have been contacted, but 247 others have not been located. In addition, of 3,899 who have been sent orders to report to a duty station, 1,374 have asked that their duty period be delayed or that they be exempted from active duty. "As we conact people, we are amenable to give them a deferral or give them more time if they've got some personal issues that they need to deal with," Byrne said. "We're basically in new territory here," he said. "That's why we're dealing with every individual case to make sure we're giving everyone appropriate time to rectify whatever situation they are in."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Silicon Valley dogfight between Oracle and PeopleSoft took a new turn Friday as PeopleSoft dumped the chief executive leading its takeover defense, and US regulators dropped their antitrust case. PeopleSoft said it was terminating president and chief executive Craig Conway, who has led the fight against a 7.7 billion dollar hostile takeover effort from rival Oracle. The company said its board voted to appoint Dave Duffield, the company founder and chairman, as CEO, and announced the appointment of two co-presidents. "These appointments followed the board's decision to terminate Craig Conway as president and CEO of the company, effective immediately," the PeopleSoft statement said. "The board said its decision resulted from a loss of confidence in Mr. Conway's ability to continue to lead the company." Meanwhile the Justice Department's top antitrust official said the government would not appeal a court decision allowing Oracle to pursue its takeover bid. US antitrust regulators had sought to block the bid, claiming it would hinder competition, but US District Judge Vaughn Walker rejected the government's arguments on September 9. "While we disagree with the district court's disappointing decision, we respect the role of the courts in the United States merger review process," said R. Hewitt Pate, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "Similarly, while we disagree with some of the legal observations in the district court's opinion, the ultimate outcome rested on detailed factual findings that would appropriately receive great deference in the appellate process." The Justice Department had argued that Oracle, PeopleSoft and Germany's SAP are the only companies that develop and sell the high-end integrated human resource and financial management software used by big companies and government agencies. Oracle bucked convention and court odds in defending itself against the suit. Typically corporations give up on takeover efforts if Justice Department lawyers deem they would be anti-competitive. "We are pleased that the Department of Justice has elected not to proceed with an appeal," said Oracle chairman Jeffrey Henley. "This affirms our longstanding belief that the transaction is not anti-competitive. We are now looking forward to the trial in Delaware of our claims against the PeopleSoft board of directors for their actions over the past year which have seriously damaged, and continue to damage, shareholder value." PeopleSoft's shares rose sharply after the PeopleSoft shakeup as Wall Street bet on a takeover, and possibly more consolidation in the sector. The shares climbed further after the Justice Department announcement. Shares in PeopleSoft surged 15 percent to 22.83, while Oracle climbed 5.5 percent to 11.90 Analyst Art Hogan of Jefferies and Co. said it was too early to say for sure that the ouster of Conway clears the way for a merger with Oracle, but Wall Street appears to be seeing it that way. "The obvious interpretation is that this makes the deal more doable," Hogan said. Hogan expected to see strength in the software sector on anticipation of more merger activity. "If this deal happens, its starts the daisy chain of a whole lot more merger and acquisition activity," he said. "We believe that this brings the company a step closer to the resolution of the bid," UBS analyst Heather Bellini said. Brendan Barnicle at Pacific Crest Securities agreed Conway's ousting makes a deal with Oracle more likely. "Conway made it clear he was against Oracle," Barnicle said. "I think the board wanted someone with a little more flexibility because it (the board) wanted to hear other options."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Friday he regretted presenting incorrect intelligence on Saddam Hussein's weapons to the United Nations last year but defended President George W. Bush's foreign policy against attacks from his Democratic challenger Senator John Kerry. Powell, who has said he wants to avoid the political limelight during the campaign for the November 2 election, avoided directly criticism of Kerry, but made clear he did not agree with the candidate's assessment that Bush is alienating allies by pursuing a unilateral approach. In comments here and in Atlanta, Georgia a day after Bush and Kerry butted heads on foreign policy in the first of three debates, Powell said the sole incorrect assertion in his February 5, 2003, presentation to the UN Security Council on Iraq's weapons was that Saddam still had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. "The only thing where we got it wrong and where the presentation did not hold up was actual stockpiles," he told reporters at the Atlanta Press Club. "We have seen nothing to suggest that he had actual stockpiles." "So that was not right, and as we have gone back and looked through the intelligence, there are indications that we had bad sourcing and we should have caught some of this bad sourcing," Powell said. "For that, I am not only disappointed but I regret that that information was not correct." In Thursday's debate, Kerry took aim at Bush's justification for going to war in Iraq, saying that Powell had been forced to apologize to world leaders for the inaccuracy of his UN presentation and that the president had erred by shifting resources from finding Osama bin Laden to ousting Saddam. However, Powell, who has previously lamented the mistakes in his UN presentation, said that despite the problem, Bush had still been right to go to war. "Those stockpiles would have reappeared since he was no longer under observation or control by the international community," he said later at the State Department after meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht. "We believe that we have now given the Iraqi people an opportunity for a better future," Powell said. "If we had not taken those actions, then Saddam Hussein would still be in Baghdad and the people of Iraq would still be suffering under the tyrant." Powell also took issue with Kerry's assertion that poor planning by Bush and his military commanders had allowed Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to escape from Afghanistan's rugged mountains at Tora Bora. "I think it's a stretch to say that somebody knew he was there and they knew it at the time the battle was going on so that we'd know how to go get him," he told the Atlanta audience. "I have no reason to believe that our commanders mishandled that." Back in Washington, Powell dismissed Kerry's charge that Bush had blundered by conducting a unilateral foreign policy that ignored the concerns of friends and allies and was exacerbating anti-American sentiment abroad. "I don't accept that characterization," he said, noting that the Bush administration had sought UN approval on the Iraq question and was working within the UN system or through separate multilateral processes on concerns about Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. "Every time we have faced one of these challenges, the United States has not acted unilaterally, we have gone to the United Nations," Powell said. "We've gone to the international community. That's what we're doing with respect to proliferation activities in Iran. It's what we're doing with respect to the North Korean program." "We'll continue to work with our friends and allies."]]></c>

They closed above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time in New York trading Friday, as traders fretted about Nigerian oil production amid the threatened rebel uprising. The Niger Delta accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's crude output of 2.3 million barrels per day. Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter and the seventh largest in the world, derives more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange earnings from oil. Most residents of the Niger Delta live in abject poverty and have benefitted little from the oil reserves in the region of creeks and mangrove swamps. Officials say Nigeria has earned over 360 billion dollars (290 billion euros) since oil was discovered in the southern Rivers State by Anglo-Dutch giant Shell in 1957. But today the country's external debts stand at a staggering 32 billion dollars. Despite the billions earned from oil, Nigeria, which on Friday celebrated the 44th anniversary of its independence from Britain, is listed among the 25 poorest countries in the world and placed 146th out of 162 on the United Nations Development Programme index of social indicators. On the World Health Organisation index the west African country occupies 186th position out of 192 member countries for the state of its health infrastructures.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Developing countries seek greater voice in IMF, World Bank leadership (ADDS detail).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Developing countries chastised the IMF and the World Bank Friday for what they said had been a failure to give them greater decision-making power in the two institutions and urged that the next World Bank president be chosen irrespective of nationality. The Group of 24 developing country ministers also said the US current account deficit drained vital funds away from poorer nations, describing the shortfall as "a misallocation of resources." Their statement came ahead of the annual meeting opening here Saturday of International Monetary Fund and World Bank policymakers. The ministers voiced "strong disappointment and concern that, after two and a half years, no progress has been made on the issues of increasing basic votes and revising the quotas of developing countries in the IMF." They warned that "the current under-representation of developing countries in the decision-making process undermines the credibility and legitimacy (of the fund and the bank) and puts their relevance into question." A country's voting power, as well as its financial commitment, in the IMF is determined by its economic position relative to other members. While quota calculations have recently been updated, according to the G24 statement, they "continue to understate the role of developing countries in the world economy." Ariel Buir of Mexico, a member of the G24 secretariat, explained what he said was bias against developing countries by pointing to the difference between prices of goods in developed countries, which are much the same both domestically and internationally, and those in developing countries where large sectors are not integrated into the world trading system and in which prices are well below international levels. He noted for example that a haircut might cost 30 dollars in Washington and five dollars in the developping world. "You are obtaining the same service but it is valued at five dollars at current market prices in the developing country and 30 dollars in Washington. "That doesn't really mean that US GDP (gross domestic product) is six times larger, but it's measured as though it's six times bigger than the other. And this introduces an enormous bias against the developing world." Demands by the developing countries for greater clout within the IMF and the World Bank are likely to intensify next June when the current term of World Bank President James Wolfensohn comes to an end. The G24 ministers said that if Wolfensohn does not seek another five-year term, there should be "a transparent selection process (to choose a successor), with a view to attracting the best candidates regardless of nationality." By tradition, the head of the World Bank is reserved for an American while the job of IMF managing director goes to a European. Elsewhere in their statement the ministers described the US current account deficit, a broad measure of foreign trade, as "a serious short- and medium-term challenge for the international economy." The shortfall is largely financed by foreign capital inflows into the United States, which according to G24 amounts to a diversion of "a substantial portion" of world savings away from the developing world. The ministers in addition expressed concern over continuing violence in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and the construction by Israel of a security wall through the West Bank, which they said harmed the social and economic interests of the Palestinians. They appealed to the IMF and the bank to increase assistance to the Palestinian people.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Adrian Lam came to the rescue of Wigan when he scored the decisive try in his side's 18-14 win which beat brave Wakefield and booked a place in next week's Super League final eliminator. Wakefield, enjoying their best ever season, were on course for a famous win when they led 14-0 after 16 minutes. But Lam, playing in his final season, came up with the decisive late score to save Wigan's blushes after they had been stunned by a three-try blast from Wakefield in a devastating seven-minute spell of attacking brilliance. Twice left winger Semi Tadulala palmed back high kicks for Colum Halpenny and David Solomona to touch down, and between those scores second rower Duncan Macgillivray slipped an attempted tackle by hooker Terry Newton to reach the line. The visitors would have been further ahead but hooker David March could land only one of his three conversion attempts while substitute Paul Handforth was also off target with a penalty. Wigan lost loose forward Sean O'Loughlin through injury early in the tie, but they calmed the Wildcats storm and struck back with two tries in four minutes. Full-back Kris Radlinski demonstrated remarkable strength to touch down despite being tackled over the line, and centre Kevin Brown shot through a gap from Newton's sharp pass close to the line. Skipper Andy Farrell kicked one of the goals to make it 14-10 and put the tie back in the balance. The visitors' lead was then cut to two points with a Farrell penalty on 50 minutes after Macgillivray had been pulled up for holding down Radlinski. The scores would have been level four minutes later but Farrell missed a comparitively easy kick at goal after Wakefield were penalised for another professional foul, following a break by Wigan stand-off Danny Orr. Solomona was the guilty man this time and he was shown the yellow card by referee Russell Smith, forcing the Wildcats to defend their slender lead with 12 men for 10 minutes. As the game remained on a knife-edge, video referee Geoff Berry disallowed tries at either end by Ben Jeffries (Wakefield) and Danny Tickle (Wigan), both for knock-ons earlier in the moves. Wakefield looked capable of hanging on, but their hopes were cruelly dashed eight minutes from the end when Lam, rushing to acting half-back following a break by Danny Orr, scooted over for the killer try and Farrell kicked his third goal.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[UNITED NATIONS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Israeli opposition leader Shimon Peres on Friday said his country was determined to stick to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan for quitting the Gaza Strip despite the latest surge in violence. He told reporters at UN headquarters in New York that Sharon had informed him earlier in the day of his intention to hold to the plan, even after days of deadly fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in the north of the strip. "The Israeli plan for unilateral withdrawal remains intact, including the dates. Nothing will be changed," Peres said after meeting here with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Sharon has said he wants to dismantle all 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip by the end of next year. Seven Palestinians were killed on Friday, a day after Sharon ordered the army to step up a massive raid to stop militant rocket attacks on southern Israel. "Measures will be taken to increase the gap between the missiles and our settlements to make sure that they won't fall on houses and people," Peres said. But he appeared to reject the US State Department's warning to use only "proportional force" in the Gaza operation, which has left at least 45 Palestinians dead in the past several days. "When you exchange fire, it's not a matter of proportion. It's a matter of blood," Peres said. "I don't think Israel is interested in initiating the bloodshed. On the contrary, we would like to stop as soon as it is possible, and completely," he said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush sharpened attacks on Senator John Kerry's Iraq war strategy Friday, as the rivals campaigned in key states a day after the Democrat's strong showing in their first debate. Bush used language that was often harsher than when he was face to face with Kerry, seizing on his foe's comment that preemptive US military action like the invasion to oust Saddam Hussein ought to pass a "global test" for legitimacy. "The president's job is not to take an international poll. The president's job is to defend America," the Republican incumbent said. "The use of troops to defend America must never be subject to a veto by countries like France." Bush's comment, made to cheering supporters in the crucial up-for-grabs state of Pennsylvania, aimed to stoke still smoldering anger among Republicans over France's opposition to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. Aides to Kerry, who was on a two-day swing aimed at converting post-debate moment his postwar plan, and vowed to convene a summit to mobilize more help for stabilizing that war-torn country. "I've been to a lot of summits," Bush said derisively at a rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania Friday. "I've never seen a meeting that would depose a tyrant, or bring a terrorist to justice." The president also wooed voters in New Hampshire, working to preserve a steady lead in national polls and a thin edge in many of the undecided states that will decide the November 2 election. Kerry, meanwhile, hoped to capitalize on solid reviews of his performance in the first of three debates to turn around what had been a flagging campaign, and aides exulted over instant polls suggesting the US public thought he had beaten Bush. A Gallup poll for CNN gave Kerry a 46 percent to 37 percent win over the president but the survey said Bush still had the support of 51 percent of voters against 47 percent for Kerry. Taking aim at Bush's charges that he would turn tail from Iraq, Kerry told supporters here: "Nobody's talking about wilting and wavering. We're talking about winning and getting the job done right." Experts warned that early post-debate polls tend to have high error margins, and that it will take days to get an accurate assessment of the exchange's impact on what is one of the hardest fought campaigns in recent US history. But many also agreed that the close-fought debate raised the stakes for the second presidential face-off, set for October 8. A third is scheduled for October 13. National security was the agreed-upon theme and Iraq dominated as the two candidates battled over how to stabilize that war-torn country, where more than 1,000 US soldiers have died amid deadly chaos that shows no sign of ebbing.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush's smirk and Kerry's smile send the wrong message, say experts.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[George W. Bush must get rid of the grimaces and smirks, John Kerry is still struggling to put on a natural smile, experts said Friday after the first presidential debate between the two rivals. While Kerry was given the best marks in some polls after Thursday night's debate, communications experts said both contenders must work on their body language ahead of the two remaining presidential debates and the November 2 election. According to Patti Wood, an Atlanta-based body language consultant, Bush had an assured first 30 minutes at the crucial first debate. "But he seemed to run out of planned stuff to say and I think he became emotional," added Wood, who has advised the US military and top firms on communications and body language. "He repeated himself so much. When you repeat the same message it makes it look as though everything is planned and rehearsed. I think it made him look childish." Wood said that Bush has a "tongue thrust" during speeches but kept this under control at the University of Miami debate. "He only did it a few times." But she added that Bush also "grimaced" and "smirked" a lot and must also control this in future debates. "I think it made him look childish, they were not presidential gestures." Taking advantage of the debate, the Democratic National Committee on Friday released a 51 second video, titled "Faces of Frustration" comparing Bush's facial expressions to Kerry's. But Kerry also has problems, Wood added. "He appeared a little bit flustered during the first 30 minutes but gained in composure as it went on." Kerry "did not look at the camera so he was not engaging the American public. He has to look at the camera and give off more warmth from his voice and smile." Wood said there was a "a lot of anger in Kerry's actions and his voice and we don't vote for anger." According to Allan Bonner, a Canadian political economy academic who also teaches communications to North American executives, said the US president had been effective in reaching his core Christian right voter base. Bush took control at the start of the debate by marching over to Kerry's side of the stage to shake his hand, said Bonner. But he also highlighted Bush's grimaces while Kerry was attacking his record on Iraq. "The reactions showed Bush looking perplexed or flummoxed," said Bonner. But the faces are not all bad for the president. "Although it is not the kind of facial expressions I would counsel, I think it was authentic. Bush breaks a lot of rules but at least he is seen as authentic." Bonner said that Kerry swayed too much, "a bit like a horse", and this made him look ineffective sometimes. "Swaying below the waist can make him look shifty. I was surprised by his body movement." Bonner and other experts say that 50-70 percent of the impact made by speakers can come from their non-verbal body actions. The Republican and Democratic campaigns set out 32 pages of regulations for the debates, mainly aimed at controlling how the candidates are seen on television screens. According to Hogan, "that much restriction on the thinking of the two candidates body language will become far more important than the candidates themselves know. No one can control their nonverbal communication with this much attention being put on verbal communication."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Costa Rican authorities said Friday they will investigate OAS Secretary General Miguel Angel Rodriguez, Costa Rica's former president, in a corruption probe involving politicians and French telecom giant Alcatel. "There is enough information and we will have to investigate him," Costa Rican Attorney General Francisco Dall'anesse said. "He will have to appear before judicial authorities to explain himself." Several Costa Rican politicians are being investigated in a graft case involving Alcatel. A leading suspect, Jose Antonio Lobo, the former director of the state-run Costa Rican Electricity Institute, told investigators Thursday that Rodriguez demanded a 60 percent cut from a "reward" that Alcatel paid after it won a license for 400,000 cellular telephone lines in 2001. Rodriguez was president from 1998-2002. The reward represented 1.5 percent, or two million dollars, of Alcatel's payment for the license, said Lobo, who for 20 years was part of Rodriguez's Christian Social Unity Party. Costa Rican media reported Thursday that Rodriguez received transfers from the bank accounts of Lobo's wife which contained money from Alcatel. In an interview with Costa Rica's Canal 7 television, the former president said from Washington that the money he received from Lobo was a loan to defray the costs of his campaign to head the OAS. "This is part of a total of 140,000 dollars that Jose Antonio Lobo loaned me," he said. Legislators have demanded Rodriguez's resignation from the Washington-based OAS and that he explain the allegation against him.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Movie icon Mel Gibson has won a restraining order against a man he claims asked the devoutly-Catholic star pray with him, court documents showed Friday. Transient Zack Sinclair, 34, allegedly trespassed on the star's estate and harassed him with a string of letters, according to letters attached to Gibson's complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on September 21. The actor, who shook up the movie industry this year with his controversial biblical epic, "The Passion of Christ," said the letters were "alarming, harassing and annoying." Sinclair allegedly came to the actor's home in the plush Los Angeles area of Malibu on September 17 and "demanded to see me, saying that he wanted to pray with me," Gibson said in the documents. After being told to leave and never to return, Sinclair reappeared at the star's home the following day, according to the actor's declaration. Then on September 19, Sinclair allegedly turned up at a church where Gibson was attending Sunday mass. He "approached me, interrupted my worship, stood extremely close from me and demanded that I pray with him," Gibson stated in the court documents. The next day, the unwanted worshipper allegedly returned to the Gibson home and rang the bell at the gate. This time, Gibson's wife, Robyn, called the police and Sinclair was arrested. The temporary restraining order issued by a Los Angeles judge on Friday also instructs Sinclair to keep away from Robyn Gibson and the couple's children. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday on whether to make the court order permanent.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices rebounded higher Friday, with prices in New York closing above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time, as traders fretted about Nigerian oil production amid a threatened rebel uprising. The light sweet crude November futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed up 48 cents at 50.12 dollars a barrel, posting a record close, on the latest Nigerian worries. In London, the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November rose 24 cents to close up at 46.62 dollars a barrel. Oil prices hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in out-of-hours deals in New York on Tuesday and 46.80 dollars in London on Tuesday amid unrest in Nigeria. "There are still concerns about Nigeria," said New York-based Refco oil analyst Marshall Steeves, referring to Friday's closing price spike. Unrest in Iraq and disruption to Gulf of Mexico oil output, caused by recent hurricanes that have struck Florida, have also stoked oil prices in recent weeks tightening US domestic stocks. "Concern about Nigeria, because a lot of Nigerian oil goes to making gasoline," said Mike Fitzpatrick, an oil trader with Fimat in New York. "I don't know if worries about gasoline inventories are justified, (there) appears to be plenty of gasoline in stockpiles," Fitzpatrick said, adding traders often worry about supplies on Fridays as they depart for the weekend. Traders are holding their breath the Nigerian government, in peace talks with rebels, will be able to stave off a threatened uprising by the rebels who said they would mount an all-out war on the government if their demands were not met. The country is a key supplier to the United States and Africa's biggest oil exporter. Asari's Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force has threatened oil installations and asked foreign oil workers to quit the region, it's one of the militias fighting for supremacy over control of the west African country's illegal oil traffic. The group claims to be fighting for the rights of the ethnic Ijaws living around the centre of Nigeria's Niger delta oil industry, which turns out about 2.3 million barrels per day. However, just after the New York market closed, two other militias in the delta, the People's Volunteer Force and the Niger Delta Vigilante, reportedly promised they would stop fighting government forces and hand in their weapons. "The groups affirm commitment to the peace offer by the president (Olusegun Obasanjo), promise to cease all hostilities against themselves and all economic and social interests of the Nigerian state," according to a statement issued by the Nigerian presidency Friday. Fighting between the military and militias in the Niger Delta, which has been going on for more than a year, has intensified in recent months. Obasanjo has warned that his government would not tolerate any "undue militancy" in the oil-rich Niger Delta. His government has been locked in peace talks with rebels, leaving oil markets on tenterhooks. "Nigerian oil is seen as crucial (by markets) because it is light, sweet oil, favoured by refineries and currently in short supply while there is a glut of sour crude," analysts at the Sucden brokerage firm said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Sudanese government and Darfur rebel delegations have been invited to the Chadian capital on Monday to hear a report from African Union observers on compliance with an April ceasefire between the two sides, Sudanese official media reported. Both Khartoum and the ethnic minority rebels have traded accusations about truce violations in Darfur which has been devastated by a bloody 19-month civil that has sparked an exodus of refugees into neighbouring Chad. The United Nations says some 50,000 have died in what it describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Nearly 1.4 million people have fled their homes. Both the United States and Germany say the government's bloody clampdown on non-Arab minorities suspected of sorting the rebels amounts to genocide. Sudan's acting foreign minister Al-Tigani Saleh Fadil told SUNA that the government was prepared to sign a protocol on humanitarian issues with the rebels "at any time." The two sides failed to reach an agreement on access for relief distribution during negotiations in the Nigerian capital in September. Khartoum accused the rebels for sabotaging a deal by insisting that both sides first agree on security arrangements. Junior foreign minister Neguib al-Kheir Abdul Wahab told the news agency that the government was "committed" to the talks, but would view the participation of the Justice and Equality Movement, one of the two rebel factions, unfavourably. Abdul Wahab said Khartoum had already informed the African Union that the JEM "was no longer an appropriate partner because of its involvement in the latest coup attempt" against the regime in Khartoum. Sudan's interior ministry claimed JEM had a hand in last week's alleged plot to overthrow the government, which the ministry blamed on the opposition Popular Congress party of jailed Islamist leader, Hassan al-Turabi.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[UNITED NATIONS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Israeli opposition leader Shimon Peres on Friday played down suggestions that his country might use a military strike against nuclear facilities in its arch-foe Iran. "I don't think Israel will lead the policies vis-a-vis Iran," Peres told reporters after meeting UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. "The problem is a world problem concerning the Americans, the Russians (and) the Europeans." He added: "There are three options, not just the military one. There is also the political and economic one." Israel used airstrikes to wipe out a nuclear reactor in neighbouring Iraq in 1981, and Israeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz on Wednesday said Iran must be stopped before it achieves nuclear capability. Iran has insisted that its nuclear programme is only for peaceful purposes and has regularly complained that Israel, which has never admitted to having nuclear capability, is the true threat to stability in the region. But world pressure has been mounting over Tehran's nuclear ambitions and the UN's nuclear watchdog has called on the Islamic regime to halt all activities related to uranium enrichment, which could lead to a nuclear weapon. "Iran is not only producing a nuclear option, but they are the centre of terror in our time," Peres said. He said there were now two leading Muslim countries in the world, Turkey and Iran. Turkey signed a military cooperation agreement with Israel since 1996. "Turkeky thinks that you can be modern and Muslim, and Iran thinks you should be only Muslim," he said, adding that he hoped the Turkish vision of a free economy and secular state would prevail "for the sake of the Muslims." Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi last week told the United Nations that Tehran would "leave no stone unturned" in trying to convince the rest of the world that its nuclear programme was only for civilian energy purposes. Under a resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has until November 25 to clear up suspicions or risk seeing the issue referred to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions -- a move backed by the United States.]]></c>

The deaths came after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the army to step up a raid started Tuesday aimed at stopping militant rocket attacks on southern Israel. Forty-five Palestinians have been killed over the past three days along with two soldiers and a woman settler in one of the bloodiest battles since the Palestinian uprising started four years ago. The latest campaign, codenamed "Days of Penitence", intensified after two Israeli toddlers were killed in Sderot, less than a kilometre (a mere half mile) across the Gaza border. Thirty-five tanks were seen entering the town of Beit Hanun at dawn Friday, while another 30 were seen pushing into Beit Lahiya and 30 more spotted moving into the eastern sector of the Jabaliya refugee camp, residents said. The White House cautioned the staunchest US ally in the Middle East to "keep in mind the impact" of such actions on the peace process, while declining to condemn Israeli action. "There continues to be ongoing violence. We've always said Israel has the right to defend itself, but it's also important to keep in mind the impact of those decisions," spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters. The US State Department called on Israel to use only "proportional force" in its military operations in Gaza and urged the Jewish state to avoid civilian casualties which it said complicated Middle East peace efforts. The Arab League roundly condemned the incursion and criticized the international sponsors of the Middle East peace process for not speaking out. One Palestinian was killed and seven wounded by an Israeli rocket fired on the Jabaliya refugee camp, medics said, while the Israeli military said that another Palestinian had been killed after militants tried to storm the Erez border crossing between the northern Gaza Strip and Israel. The botched attack was jointly claimed by the Islamist Hamas movement and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a radical group affiliated to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement. The other five of Friday's Palestinian victims died in two air raids on Jabaliya, sources on both sides said. Two were Hamas militants. An army spokeswoman said they were about to fire a Qassam rocket. Palestinian witnesses said an unmanned plane had fired on the Hamas men. Medics said at least 14 people had been wounded in the two air strikes and that a third one, also on Jabaliya, had wounded another person. "The activity in Gaza has one clear overriding aim -- to prevent the firing of Qassam rockets at Sderot and theees (UNWRA) accused the Israeli army of taking over schools while pupils were still in class, and using them as firing positions. "They have now taken positions in these three schools and are using them as a military camp for their ongoing campaign, using them also as firing positions," UNRWA spokesman Matthias Burchard said in Geneva. "UNRWA strongly protests the totally unacceptable misuse of clearly marked UN installations and calls on the Israeli military to respect the neutrality of these places." The latest deaths brought the overall toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising to 4,400, including 3,376 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count.]]></c>

In the United States, President George W. Bush and challenger John Kerry held their first debate before November 2 polls, with Kerry terming the invasion of Iraq "a colossal error" and Bush replying that "the world is better off without Saddam Hussein." Iraq's hostage crisis showed no let-up, with Jakarta confirming two female nationals were among the 10 latest victims. Al-Jazeera television said the two were seized along with six Iraqis and two Lebanese working for an electrical equipment firm. An Indonesian diplomat appeared on the news channel, appealing for the women's release. A massive force of 3,000 US troops and 2,000 Iraqi auxiliaries poured into Samarra before dawn and seized the city hall and police stations in the largest joint operation since last year's invasion. The armoured assault came just a day after the US-backed interim government vowed to restore control over all insurgent enclaves in the restive Sunni Arab belt north and west of Baghdad by next month in readiness for nationwide polls promised for January. "In response to repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces (US military terminology for insurgents), Iraqi security forces and multinational forces secured the government and police buildings in Samarra," the US military said. A spokesman said 114 insurgents were killed for the loss of just one US soldier. Four more American troops were wounded. Samarra's main hospital received 90 dead and 180 wounded, said Dr Khaled Ahmed. There was intense fighting between troops and insurgents in the city centre around the gold-domed Imam Ali al-Hadi mausoleum, a revered Shiite Muslim shrine in the midst of this overhwelmingly Sunni Arab city of some 250,000 people. Smoke billowed into the sky as the two sides traded fire on the hallowed ground, but the Iraqi army's 36th Commando Battalion secured the area and there was no damage to the mausoleum, the military said. A Turkish hostage was freed by US troops in the city, it added. By midday (0900 GMT), US forces held the city hall and police stations, while Iraqi troops had won control of key heritage sites, including the renowned spiral minaret of the ninth-century Al-Malwiya mosque on Samarra's outskirts. Iraqi forces captured 37 insurgents, said National Security Advisor Qassem Daoud. The massive offensive came despite mounting talk in recent days of an imminent deal between insurgents and Iraq's interim authorities for a peaceful restoration of government control. Only Thursday, proof car bombings and other violence across the Sunni Arab belt, which fared relatively well under Saddam's Sunni-dominated regime. Late Friday, loud explosions rocked Fallujah and residents described the blasts as air strikes. There was no immediate confirmation from the Americans. A double suicide car bombing at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Baghdad Thursday killed 34 children and eight adults, capping one of Iraq's deadliest months that saw nearly 600 people killed, according to an AFP count. Adults and children in the poverty-stricken neighbourhood of Al-Amel, where the streets are filled with rubbish and sewage, were gathered for the opening of a brand-new water pump station built by the US military. On Friday, the working-class Baghdad neighbourhood buried its dead. The attacks followed another car bombing west of the capital that killed one US soldier and two Iraqis. In a new bid to secure the release of British hostage Kenneth Bigley, 100,000 leaflets from his family appealing for the 62-year-old engineer's release were handed out at Baghdad mosques, some of them in areas loyal to the insurgents, the British embassy said. But an unofficial French mediator acknowledged in Damascus that his bid to secure the release of two captive French newsmen had failed. French lawmaker Didier Julia said US forces had attempted several times to torpedo the rescue mission, leaving six Iraqi security guards dead in one incident. But the US military called Julia's allegations untrue. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin refused to be downcast, saying the information coming out of Iraq about the hostages was "not complete" and that the government still had "a favourable outlook" about the prospects for a happy ending.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Colin Powell and his Belgian counterpart on Friday lauded a vast improvement in US-Belgium ties that had been badly strained by the war in Iraq and a Belgian law under which war crimes suits were brought against American officials. "It is no secret that there were some disagreements over the past year or two with Belgium on selected issues, such as universal competency law and some issues with respect to Iraq but those have been cleared up," Powell said after meeting Karel De Gucht at the State Department. "We're looking to a future where we have even more opportunities to cooperate with each other, to work with each other in our common cause against terrorism, in our common cause to see a Europe that is whole, free and united," he said. Powell noted assistance Belgium has given to Afghan reconstruction efforts and the willingness of Brussels to help the UN mission in Iraq which is now preparing for national elections to be held by the end of January. De Gucht said he and Powell had focused mainly on the future but expressed pleasure that the previous disagreements over Iraq and the so-called "universal competency law" were over. "I am very pleased that the problems have been solved, notably about the universal competence, because I have always understood your irritation in this specific topic," he said. The law had allowed Belgian courts to rule on such allegations regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator or where the crimes took place but has now been changed to apply only to Belgian nationals. Belgium had also drawn Washington's wrath when it joined other NATO allies like France and Germany last year in strongly opposing the US-led war in Iraq.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Brazilian government Friday denied acquiring key nuclear technology from Pakistan amid allegations that a smuggling network headed by disgraced Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan may be the source. Brazil's navy, which launched the South American nation's nuclear program in the 1980s, said in a statement that it "denies any type of link with Pakistan regarding the development of Brazilian centrifuges." Brazil's Ministry of Science and Technology said it "objects to news accounts attributed to anonymous sources without the support of any institution or country and that try to link decades of scientific development and technologies to obscure procedures or to international scandals." Henry Sokolski, a former Pentagon official who now runs the Non-Proliferation Policy Education Center think tank in Washington, told AFP Friday that Brazil's centrifuges look similiar to a type sold by Khan's network, which supplied Iran, Libya and North Korea. On Thursday, the daily Estado de Sao Paulo reported that Sokolski said in Washington that officials in the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency suspect that the network is the source of Brazil's centrifuge technology. Centrifuges are used to enrich uranium, a process that makes what can be fuel for civilian reactors but also the explosive core of atomic bombs. Brazil, which is widely believed to have a peaceful nuclear program, has since February blocked IAEA inspectors from coming to inspect its uranium enrichment facilities, saying it wanted to protect industry secrets. IAEA inspectors are due to arrive in Brazil on October 15 to resolved the dispute.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[More than 600 former soldiers fail to report for duty: army by Jim Mannion (- ADDS details, quotes).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[More than 600 former soldiers who were mobilized in July from a rarely tapped pool of reservists have failed to report for duty, and hundreds more have asked for delays or exemptions from the call-up, senior army officials said Friday. So far no one has been declared "absent without leave," and the army still expects to meet the goal of a call-up in July of the army's Individual Ready Reserve officials said. But the response reflects the pervasive strains the army faces as it strives to keep combat units manned and ready for duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. In calling up the Individual Ready Reserve, the army is turning to former soldiers who left the service with no expectation of being recalled to active duty except in a national emergency. The last time the IRR was called up was in the 1991 Gulf War. Many were surprised by the army's decision to mobilize 5,674 former soldiers from the IRR to fill vacancies in combat units deploying to Iraq or Afghanistan. The army itself assumed that only about 4,400 of those would actually be put on active duty, with the remainder washing out for medical or other reasons. Brigadier General Sean Byrne, the army's director of personnel policy, told reporters the army still expects to meet that goal. "About a third of them for one reason or another will be exempted. I think the 4,400 number is probably pretty solid," he said. But Byrne acknowledged that the army is watching the mobilization figures closely, and going to extra lengths to contact former soldiers who had failed to report for duty to discuss their situation. "There is no one who has had a duty status change where they are considered AWOL," Byrne said. "There are a number of people we have contacted where we are working their individual cases, but no one is considered AWOL at this point." He said 622 soldiers ordered to report for duty since August 31 have failed to do so. Of those, 375 have been contacted, but 247 others have not been located. In addition, of 3,899 who have been sent orders to report to a duty station, 1,374 have asked that their duty period be delayed or that they be exempted from active duty. "As we contact people, we are amenable to give them a deferral or give them more time if they've got some personal issues that they need to deal with," Byrne said. "We're basically in new territory here," he said. "That's why we're dealing with every individual case to make sure we're giving everyone appropriate time to rectify whatever situation they are in." Robert Smiley, principal assistant secretary of the army for manpower and reserve affairs, said the army probably will have to tap into IRR next year as well in about the same numbers for troop rotations in Iraq and Afghanistan in late 2005 and early 2006. The aould deny that. And for some people, some of our prospects, or our target age young men or women, that is in fact a drawback, and it will deter some of them," he told reporters. "For others that is precisely their call to action," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KISSIMMEE, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democratic challenger John Kerry roared back to the campaign trail Friday, piling more scorn on President George W. Bush's Iraq policy, as he shot for a comeback in the race for the White House. Kerry's motorcade swept past trees bent like bananas and scores of homes with thin plastic sheeting draped over hurricane-damaged roofs, as he launched a swing through the crucial battleground state of Florida. Energised by his showing in Thursday night's debate at the University of Miami, which snap polls and political pundits said he had won handily, Kerry delivered another withering strike at Bush over Iraq. He charged the president, who prides himself on decisive leadership, was dogmatic in refusing accept criticism despite an accelarating insurgency in the occupied country. "The president keeps trying to debate himself on that," Kerry said at a rally in Tampa, stealing one of the lines Bush had used to lampoon his rival. "He keeps trying to say 'we don't want somebody who wants to leave, we don't want a wilter or a waverer.'" "Mr President, nobody is talking about leaving, nobody is talking about wilting and wavering, we are talking about winning and getting the job done right," Kerry told cheering supporters at the University of South Florida. Turning the tables on Bush was a central theme of the day, as Kerry aides potrayed the President as rambling and confused -- the same line of attack which dented Kerry's poll numbers and given the incumbant a modest lead. "They have been saying, 'look, Kerry's a flip-flopper -- we're the steady, strong leader,' then they (viewers) turn on the television and it's exactly the opposite," said senior Kerry advisor Mike McCurry. "Kerry's the one who looks strong and steady and concise. and the other guy was rambling and distracted, and criss-crossing back and forth on what he was trying to say." But Kerry, who also ripped into Bush for what he said was a failure to properly organize initiatives like a unified terrorist watch list, didn't have it all his own way. His aides were forced to deflect a Bush claim that Kerry's pledge Thursday to measure prospective US action abroad against a "global test" would put the US military in the hands of nation's like his administration's bete-noire, France. Kerry spokesman David Wade said the president took Kerry's words out of context. "It's evidence of how much their candidate is flailing and how much they want to try to distract from that. It's nonsense," he told AFP. But aides downplayed expectations Kerry's performance would spark an immediate surge in the polls, saying only that the Massachusetts senator had just started to reintroduce himself to voters after a months-long Republican effort to wound him through negative advertising. Kerry moved on from Tampa to another rally in Kissimmee, Florida, and was due to stump in the state governed by the president's brother Jeb on Saturday before returning to Washington for a reception with his running mate John Edwards. Aides are already looking to the next clash with Bush, on October 8, and the two rivals will go at it for the final time on October 13.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Steam eruption shakes Mount St Helens (RECASTS).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SEATTLE, Washington, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US volcano Mount St. Helens roared to life Friday, spewing a giant plume of steam and ash into the sky and raising fears of a new larger eruption. After letting off steam from its lava cap in a spectacular natural display, the rumblings stopped and the huge cloud quickly dispersed. But the burst of activity sent scientists scrambling to establish whether the volcano, which killed 57 people when it erupted dramatically 24 years ago, was holding another more powerful eruption in store. US Geological Survey scientists said the eruption at 11:57am (1857 GMT) marked a "small explosion" following a week of intensifying earthquakes in the area. "This was small explosive eruption from the lava dome that lasted for 24 minutes and generated a plume that rose up to a height of just under 10,000 feet (3,000 meters)," said USGS volcano and hydrology expert John Major. "The eruption was predominantly steam but containing a little bit of ash," he said adding that there were no lava or mud flows from the crater and that the alert level in the region had not been raised. The steam cloud poured from the southern edge of a 300-meter tall (1,000-foot) lava dome in the volcano's crater that has risen in recent days. An area of two-to-four hectares (five to 10 acres) on the lava cap rose and fractured during the eruption, releasing glacial water and the column of steam, Major said. The last explosion from the dome took place in 1986. The steam cloud drifted southwest from the mountain peak in southern Washington state and aviation officials warned aircraft in the area to avoid the plume, Federal Aviation Authority officials told AFP. Seismic experts scrutinised the volcano from aircraft and from the mountainside to determine whether further eruptions were expected from the volcano that has been extremely active for more than 4,000 years. "We are going to keep a very close eye on it," Major told journalists in Seattle, adding that the level of earthquake activity in the area would be a crucial indicator of what is to come. "If the seismicity in the area does not ease off, it's a sign that it's not over yet. If we do not see anything over the coming days, then there is a good chance that that might be it," he said. But another USGS expert Jeff Wynn warned that while the volcanic activity had ceased for the moment, it could come roaring back at any time. "The history of this volcano suggests that this could be the opening salvo of more eruptions," he said adding that the small 1986 eruption was similar to the latest one. Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US Navy Secretary Gordon England said Friday that an allegation of torture by a detainee at a military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba will be investigated. England said he had no knowledge of the allegations made by Moazzam Begg, a British national detained in Guantanamo, in a four page handwritten letter made public in London by his lawyers. "I don't know of any cases like that," England told reporters here. "But, again, if there's an allegation like that, it'll certainly be investigated." Begg, who was captured in Pakistan in February 2002, said in the letter that he was subjected to "pernicious threats of torture, actual vindictive torture and death threats" during interrogations, particularly in Afghanistan. "In this atmosphere of severe antipathy towards detainees was the compounded use of racially and religiously prejudiced taunts." "This culminated, in my opinion, with the deaths of two fellow detainees at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness," he alleged.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Wall Street ends week on rally as PeopleSoft, economic news offer cheer.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Wall Street shares closed with a rally Friday, driven by the news that PeopleSoft Inc had decided to remove its chief executive and as several economic reports gave the market added cheer. Several bullish car sales reports, notably from the world's number one automaker, General Motors Corp, which posted a hefty sales rise in September, also supported the gains, as the market shrugged off a spike in oil prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 112.38 points, or 1.11 percent, at 10,192.65 while the tech-laden Nasdaq composite rallied 45.36 points, or 2.39 percent, to 1,942.20. The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index advanced 16.92 points, or 1.52 percent, to 1,131.50. Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak said Wall Street opened on an upbeat note, lifted by overseas markets after a strong reading of the closely-followed Tankan business sentiment survey in Japan. There is also "optimism that now that we are actually going to get third quarter earnings as opposed to just pre-announcements, that maybe it won't be as bad as the pre-announcements implied," Boockvar said. The market largely appeared to dismiss the surge in oil prices, with the New York contract closing above 50 dollars for the first time. The tech sector buoyed the markets after key upgrades and on news that PeopleSoft's board is seeking to remove chief executive Craig Conway, possibly clearing the way for a takeover by Oracle. PeopleSoft closed up 2.98 dollars, or 15 percent, at 22.83 dollars while Oracle's stock rose 62 cents, or 5.5 percent, to 11.90 dollars. On the economic front, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in slightly below expectations at 94.2 from 95.8 earlier in the month. But construction spending rose by a better-than-expected 0.8 percent in August. And the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, while falling to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 percent in August, still showed strong growth. "You can't have a strong manufacturing sector without decent underlying economic fundamentals," said Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors. Eagerly awaited September sales reports from the big automakers also lent support to the market's upswing. General Motors Corp. said its sales of new vehicles in September surged 20 percent year-over-year. GM said in a statement it sold 458,799 new cars and trucks in September. Passenger car sales rose three percent to 171,670 units while truck sales, including pick-ups, sport-utility vehicles and mini-vans, rose 32.5 percent to 287,129 units last month. GM closed up 66 cents, or 1.6 percent, at 43.14 dollars. The Chrysler Group said it notched up a 10-percent sales rise in September from the same month a year ago, yielding sales of 168,744 units. However, the Ford Motor Company said new vehicle sales dropped four percent from a year ago last month to 282,656 new cars and trucks. Ford closed up 14 cents, or one percent, at 14.19 dollars in line with wider market gains. Bond prices fell as traders moved into equities. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 4.191 percent from 4.119 percent Thursday and that on the 30-year bond to 4.949 percent from 4.891 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Niger Delta rebels sign ceasefire, disarmament deal: officials (ADDS regional government reax).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ABUJA, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rebels in the Niger Delta, where unrest sent world oil prices soaring this week, promised Friday to stop fighting government forces and hand in their weapons, the Nigerian president's office said. "The groups affirm commitment to the peace offer by the president, promise to cease all hostilities against themselves and all economic and social interests of the Nigerian state," it said in a statement. The rebels threatened earlier this week to go to war if their demands for a bigger slice of Nigeria's oil wealth, greater autonomy for the Ijaw people -- the delta's dominant tribe -- and a national debate on Nigeria's problems were not met. Mujahid Dokubo Asari, leader of the People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), began talks Wednesday with officials from President Olusegun Obasanjo's government ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to quit the Niger Delta. Asari and Ateke Tom, leader of the rival Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV) group, both signed the ceasefire deal, in which they promise "the disbandment of all militias and militant groups as well as total disarmament," according to the statement from the presidency. "It is a victory for my people," Asari told AFP by telephone. "It is the first time that the president and the government of Nigeria recognised that nationalities in Nigeria have the right to ask for resources control and self-determination. It is a giant step forward," he added. Fighting between the army and militias in the Niger Delta, which has been going on for more than a year, intensified in recent months. Violence escalated in August when the army launched attacks on rebel camps. Some 500 people have died in unrest in the region in recent weeks, according to Amnesty International, but the government said only 13 were killed. The unrest helped send oil prices on an upward spiral which saw them burst through the 50-dollar-a-barrel barrier on Tuesday, but drop back below the crucial mark when the peace talks began. They closed above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time in New York trading Friday, as traders fretted about Nigerian oil production amid the threatened rebel uprising. The government of Nigeria's Rivers State which borders Delta welcomed the ceasefire and disarmament agreement. "It is a welcome development. The peace deal is a follow-up to a previous initiative of the Rivers State government asking armed gangs to stop killing themselves and confronting the federal government," state government spokesman Emmanuel Okah told AFP. "The government is prepared to integrate them (Asari and Tom) into the larger society but they have to faithfully implement the agreement by disarming and disbanding their groups. They have to also surrender their weapons," he said. The government would grant tebrated the 44th anniversary of its independence from Britain, is listed among the 25 poorest countries in the world and placed 146th out of 162 on the United Nations Development Programme index of social indicators. On the World Health Organisation index the west African country occupies 186th position out of 192 member countries for the state of its health infrastructures.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[DAMASCUS, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A French lawmaker said here Friday that US forces had torpedoed his mission to secure the release of two French journalists held in Iraq, leaving six Iraqi security guards dead in one incident. It was not immediately clear when the six were allegedly killed, and the US military in Baghdad immediately rejected the accusation. Didier Julia, a lawmaker for President Jacques Chirac's ruling party, said his assistant Philippe Brett had persuaded the kidnapppers to release Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot, who were abducted near Baghdad on August 20 with their Syrian driver. They had left in two separate convoys from their place of detention and headed for the Syrian border, he said at a press conference in the Syrian capital Damascus. Both convoys came under US fire, he said. "They (the US military) set up 20 roadblocks and. six members of the team protecting the journalists were killed," said Julia, whose mission enjoys no backing from the French foreign ministry. He said the six killed were Iraqi "guards" providing security for the journalists, adding that five houses where they lived were destroyed by coalition bombardments. He did not give details on the locations of the alleged incidents. "The American forces absolutely want to eliminate the people who are protecting them (the hostages)," Julia said. Julia said Brett had learnt of one last incident which prevented the journalists and their guards from pursuing their way to Syria as soon as he arrived separately at the Syrian border and headed straight back to the journalists' captors. "The three Frenchmen are still in Iraq in the hands of the resistance," he said. The US military in Baghdad rejected Julia's accusations. "I'd say that none of that is true. I have not seen any reports that would indicate any of these stories showing up are accurate or true," said senior spokesman Rear Admiral Greg Slavonic. Julia, 70, is vice president of the Iraqi-French Friendship Group and an Arabic-speaker with ties to the Middle East. An insurgent group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq is believed to be holding the two French journalists. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said earlier Friday that the latest reports about the journalists were "not complete" and expressed caution but also hope they would be freed soon. The comments came after Brett, the French lawmaker's assistant, told a radio station he was in Iraq with the detained reporters, and said he expected to be able to announce their release within hours. French officials have publicly distanced themselves from Julia and Brett.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The dollar moved slightly against major currencies Friday after key US ISM data on manufacturing was in line with expectations, as the market remained cautious on the prospects for the US economy. The single European currency fell to 1.2411 dollars at 2130 GMT from 1.2435 late Thursday in New York. The dollar rose to 110.52 yen from 110.02 Thursday. The Institute for Supply Management reported that US factory activity had eased just slightly, with its headline index falling to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 in August, suggesting that the US economic recovery was gaining some traction. Construction spending in the United States by 0.8 percent in August, double the rate expected by analysts. "This report was not as strong as the Chicago PMI report for September. Nevertheless, the level of this index is consistent with continued very solid growth in manufacturing activity," Bear Stearns analysts said in a statement. The solid report caused only a very limited rise in the dollar, however, with the market still remaining cautious on the outlook for the US economy amid fears over the impact of higher oil prices. "We continue to view levels of US yields as low relative to our own expectations for growth, inflation and Fed (Federal Reserve) policy in the coming months, and are thus cautious about the prospects for the dollar to break out of its broad consolidation range and resume its structural downtrend at this time," said Daniel Katzive, currency analyst at UBS. Investors are also unwilling to adjust positions ahead of the Group of Seven meeting this weekend, analysts said. In late New York trade, the dollar was changing hands at 1.2495 Swiss francs against 1.2455 Thursday. The British pound was at 1.7991 dollars from 1.8117 late Thursday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[DETROIT, Michigan, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Year-end incentives aimed at clearing car dealers' lots for 2005 models boosted September sales for Chrysler and General Motors but Ford sales lagged from the same month last year. GM said new vehicle sales in September surged about 20 percent year-over-year, with both passenger car and truck sales posting gains. The world's number-one automaker said in a statement it sold 458,799 new cars and trucks in September. Passenger car sales rose three percent to 171,670 units while truck sales, including pick-ups, sport-utility vehicles and minivans, rose 32.5 percent to 287,129 units last month. The Chrysler Group reported a 10-percent rise, boosted by sales of its Jeep and Dodge-branded models. The automaker, a division of the DaimlerChrysler AG group, said it sold a total of 168,744 units in September. Ford said new vehicle sales -- mostly passenger cars -- dropped four percent, but that its F-Series truck set a new September record with sales of 99,720 units, up 22 percent from last year's record sales. Overall, the number-two US automaker said it sold 282,656 new cars and trucks in September, down from the 294,991 vehicles sold in the same month a year ago. Passenger car sales slipped 19 percent to 70,683, while truck sales, including sport-utility vehicles and mini-vans, rose two percent to 211,973 units, Ford said. The company markets Mercury, Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo and Land Rover. Analysts had predicted September sales to come in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 16.8 million to 17 million. Early indications, bolstered by Ford and General Motors results, show that the final overall sales number will top original forecasts. "Chrysler was essentially in line with our projection, but GM had a huge month," said Steve Stanley, chief economist at Greenwich Capital Markets. "Cars were modestly ahead of our estimate, but trucks were 50,000 above our projection." Stanley added that GM's results, along with Ford's strong truck sales numbers, should bring overall auto sales to 17.5 million, well above what Wall Street had predicted. August sales came in at about 17 million. Helping to spur demand last week, General Motors offered a three-day, end-of-month, zero-percent financing deal to clear out 2004 models, and Ford quickly followed with a similar five-day special. George Pipas, Ford's U.S. sales analysis manager, said in a conference call that the zero-percent financing announcement "clearly had a positive effect on sales this month." GM turned in mostly higher than expected results thanks in large part to steep discounting offers. The company posted sales of 458,799 vehicles, up 19.9 percent from 367,496 vehicles sold a year ago.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[American photographer Richard Avedon dead at 81 (ADDS quotes).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[American photographer Richard Avedon, renowned for his fashion work and minimalist black and white portraits of 20th century icons such as Marylin Monroe and Charlie Chaplin, died Friday at the age of 81, the New Yorker magazine announced. New Yorker spokeswoman Perri Dorset said that Avedon died in the Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, Texas where he suffered a brain hemorrhage last month while on a photo shoot for the magazine. Avedon had been taking pictures for several months across the United States for a commission titled "On Democracy". His most recent work published by New Yorker was of Italian artist Maurizio Catalan and before that Teresa Heinz-Kerry, the wife of Democratic presidential challenger John Kerry. But Avedon has long been one of the giants of international photography with his signature stark black and white portraits of models, actors and musicians. Born in New York in 1923, Avedon dropped out of high school and joined the Merchant Marine where he was put in the photographic section. Upon his return in 1944, he became a photographer in a department store but within two years had won over Harper's Bazaar and was working for that fashion magazine as well as Vogue. Increasingly, portraits became his main passion and he earned a reputation with his ability to to present the personal views and emotions of public figures. Monroe, Chaplin, Brigitte Bardot, Jean Renoir, President Dwight Eisenhower all posed for Avedon. Many stars asked Avedon to take their images for public consumption. In 1957, Hollywood paid tribute to him through the musical comedy, "Funny Face", which starred Fred Astaire as a fashionable photographer inspired by Avedon, and Audrey Hepburn. In 1959 he worked with Truman Capote on a book, "Observations", on some of the most famous and important people of the century. It included pictures of Buster Keaton, Gloria Vanderbilt, Pablo Picasso, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Mae West. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Avedon worked for Vogue magazine, taking some of the most famous portraits of the times. In 1992 he became the first staff photographer for the New Yorker, and two years later the Whitney Museum brought together fifty years of his work in the retrospective, "Richard Avedon: Evidence". In 2003 the Metropolitan Museum held its own retrospective, "Richard Avedon: Portraits". Reflecting on his roots, Avedon said in a 1994 interview with the French magazine Egoiste, "My father wanted me to be a businessman because he had suffered terribly as a Russian Jew in New York City at the turn of the century. "He had a terrible life as a child, one of six children deserted by his father, sent to an orphan asylum, he had a tragic quality and an exaggerated sense of danger. "He wanted me to be prepared for what he calls The Battle in the ways that he felt one had to be prepared: through education, physical strength and money." On his work, Avedon told the magazine, "My portraits are much more about me than they are about the people I photograph. "I used to think that it was a collaboration, that it was something that happened as a result of what the subject wanted to project and what the photographer wanted to photograph," he said. "I no longer think it is that at all. The photographer has complete control, the issue is a moral one and it is complicated."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Group of Seven industrial powers called Friday for more debt relief for the world's poorest nations, but stopped short of endorsing a specific plan for writing off debt. "We are now committed to addressing the sustainability of debt of the poorest countries by making progress on debt relief and grant financing," said a statement issued after a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers. The statement stopped short of endorsing a proposal by Britain to write off its share of debt and avoided any mention of a call for a 100-percent writeoff of poor nations' debt, sought by some activists. In poverty reduction efforts, the G7 said, "There is a need for additional financial aid grounded on the principles of good policies, debt sustainability, accounting for results, and enhancing predictability and aid effectiveness." Two groups pressing for a full writeoff of debt to the poorest countries criticized the G7 for a lack of action. "The G7 have chosen to delay debt cancellation that could have put 100 million children into school," said Oxfam's Max Lawson. "Once again rich countries have turned up with their notebooks not their checkbooks, and the price will be paid by the world's poorest people." "Rich countries' delay in breaking the log-jam on debt leaves the poorest countries paying out 100 million dollars a day that could be spent on health and education. The poor cannot wait," said Patrick Watt of Action Aid. On Sunday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said his Labour government will unilaterally write off its share of debts owed to the World Bank and other development banks, and urged other wealthy nations to follow. The move provided fresh impetus to a movement to press the G7 along with the IMF and World Bank to find a way to wipe out the debts that are crushing many poor nations. But the rest of the G7, which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, have different ideas. One plan to tax international capital flows, advocated by presidents Jacques Chirac of France and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, has been rejected by some G7 nations, notably the United States. Germany, meanwhile, has resisted efforts for a writeoff of debt.]]></c>

The suspects, mostly Latin Americans, were rounded up in a three-day operation in southeastern Florida. The alleged crimes include grand theft, sexual battery, drug trafficking and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the ICE Florida field office said in a statement. Of the 31 suspects, 24 are legal permanent residents of the United States and face possible deportation, the statement said. "Having a legal status in this country doesn't give any person the right to victimize our communities," said Michael Rozos, the ICE's Florida field office director. The suspects include six Colombians, five Peruvians, four Hondurans, four Salvadorans, two Brazilians, two Guatemalans, two Nicaraguans, an Ecuadoran, a Briton, a Turk, a German, a Haitian and a Venezuelan. "This local operation is part of a significant ongoing law enforcement effort specifically focused on ensuring that criminal aliens who have no legal right to remain in the United States no longer pose a threat to our communities," the statement said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Following is the text of the statement issued by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers after a meeting in Washington Friday: We thank the United States for presiding over the G7 this past year and we are gratified by the international economic cooperation that has resulted in new initiatives such as the Agenda for Growth, the Strategic Review, the Global Remittance Initiative, and new G7 outreach to both the Broader Middle East and North Africa countries and to China. We welcome the United Kingdom to the G7 presidency in 2005, and we will continue to work together on these and new initiatives. Global economic growth is strong and the outlook for 2005 remains favorable. Inflation and inflation expectations remain low in our economies. However, this is not the time for complacency. Growth is higher in some regions than in others; imbalances persist. Oil prices remain high and are a risk. So first, we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate. Second, it is important consumer nations increase energy efficiency. Third, it is important for consumers and producers that oil markets function efficiently and we encourage the IEA to enhance its work on oil data transparency. We will return to the issue of medium term energy demand and supply at our next meeting. We reaffirmed our commitment to sound public finances and to strategies for sustained medium term fiscal consolidation. Today we released a new report on our Agenda for Growth in which we agreed to make pro-growth structural reforms a regular part of our work to create more jobs and increase productivity. We welcome recent progress on the Doha Development Round. We reaffirm that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. We continue to monitor exchange markets closely and cooperate as appropriate. In this context, we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the international financial system, based on market mechanisms. We remain firmly committed to continue to cooperate in combating terrorist financing, which is essential for reducing the risks of terrorist attacks. Emerging market economies generally face favorable financial conditions; interest rate spreads are low and volatility is down in many markets. We urge emerging market countries to take advantage of the favorable global economic conditions to lessen their vulnerability to external shocks. We urge the Argentine authorities to implement, as soon, as possible the prior actions required for the completion of the Third Review while fulfilling its current obligations fully and timely. Argentina's key challenges remain structural reforms, building a sound fiscounting for results, and enhancing predictability and aid effectiveness. We encourage the development banks to provide quantifiable indicators and results for all projects, and to make them publicly available. We are now committed to addressing the sustainability of debt of the poorest countries by making progress on debt relief and grant financing. We will prepare a progress report on these efforts by the end of the year.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Group of Seven finance chiefs called on oil producers for help Friday in keeping energy prices manageable as they pledged action to alleviate the debt burden on poor countries and renewed an appeal for exchange rate flexibility. Finance ministers and central bankers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States also gave an upbeat assessment for global economic prospects next year, describing them as "favorable." But they warned in a statement following a meeting here that growth was uneven and at risk from high oil prices. "We call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate," they said, adding that consumers had to boost energy efficiency. The G7 statement also took note of increased agitation for action by rich countries to ease the debt burden carried by the world's most impoverished nations, many of which spend more on debt servicing than on social welfare. "We are now committed to addressing the sustainability of debt of the poorest countries by making progress on debt relief and grant financing," the statement said. US Treasury Secretary John Snow earlier this week said more debt relief was needed but did not specifically endorse a British proposal to erase all debts from the poorest countries. "Grants and debt relief must be significantly increased -- we are considering more options to do so, including those that would provide up to 100-percent debt relief and grants from the international financial institutions," Snow said. On Sunday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown had said his Labour government would unilaterally write off its share of debts owed to the World Bank and other development banks and urged other wealthy nations to follow suit. The statement said the world economy was also bedevilled by "excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates," which it described as "undesirable for economic growth." The ministers reterated their oft-repeated call for greater exchange rate flexibility, which they said was "desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the international financial system. " The appeal was directed primarily at China, which has come under increased G7 pressure to abandon its practice of pegging its currency to the dollar. Government and business leaders in the United States and elsewhere contend that the peg undervalues the yuan, making Chinese exports cheaper -- and more competitive -- while increasing the cost of foreign goods in the Chinese market. The US Treasury Department earlier announced that Chinese officials, who were to dine with their G7 counterparts later in the day, had agreed to move steadily toward a more flexible exchange rate system. But it was not immediately clear if the statement of intent was sufficient to satisfy the G7. Elsewhere the ministers welcomed this week's decision by the International Monetary Fund executive board to award Iraq a 436-million-dollar emergency loan, which they said was "an important step toward our commitment to resolve Iraq's debt before the end of 2004." They also urged Argentine authorities to take rapid steps to implement measures sought by the IMF "as soon as possible. while fulfilling its current obligations fully and timely."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[CIA Director Peter Goss has moved swiftly to put in place a new leadership team at the US intelligence agency, replacing its executive director and naming two other people to senior advisory positions, US officials said Friday. The changes comes amid intense political pressure for an overhaul of the US intelligence establishment in response to the weaknesses exposed by the September 11, 2001 attacks and the war in Iraq. Goss replaced AB "Buzzy" Krongard as CIA executive director with Michael Kostiw, a former staffer of the House intelligence Committee, which Goss chaired before becoming CIA director, a US official said. The CIA executive director ranks third in CIA hierarchy, runs its day-to-day operations and is the most senior official dedicated solely to agency business. Also named to newly created jobs were Merrell Morehead, as Goss' senior advisor for strategic programs, and Jay Jakub, senior advisor for operations and analysis, the official said. Like Kostiw, they are former intelligence committee staff members. Goss's appointments, which were not publicly announced, cover broad areas of responsibility -- both within the CIA and in a larger intelligence community that includes military intelligence and agencies that collect and interpret imagery and signals. Jakub's appointment appears likely to become a source of tension with the CIA's director of operations, who is responsible for espionage, and its director of intelligence, who is responsible for analysis. "On the face of it, it's a pretty big job," said the US official. "But I wouldn't want you to think the director of operations, or intelligence will report to the DCI through this genetleman." "This is sort of seen as a position that will strengthen the disciplines of analysis and collection operations community wide," the official said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Niger Delta rebels sign ceasefire, disarmament deal: officials by Ola Awoniyi and Emmanuel Goujon.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ABUJA, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rebels in the Niger Delta, where unrest sent world oil prices soaring this week, promised Friday to stop fighting government forces and hand in their weapons, the Nigerian president's office said. "The groups affirm commitment to the peace offer by the president, promise to cease all hostilities against themselves and all economic and social interests of the Nigerian state," it said in a statement. The rebels threatened earlier this week to go to war if their demands for a bigger slice of Nigeria's oil wealth, greater autonomy for the Ijaw people -- the delta's dominant tribe -- and a national debate on Nigeria's problems were not met. Mujahid Dokubo Asari, leader of the People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), began talks Wednesday with officials from President Olusegun Obasanjo's government ahead of an October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to quit the Niger Delta. Asari and Ateke Tom, leader of the rival Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV) group, both signed the ceasefire deal, in which they promise "the disbandment of all militias and militant groups as well as total disarmament," according to the statement from the presidency. "It is a victory for my people," Asari told AFP by telephone. "It is the first time that the president and the government of Nigeria recognised that nationalities in Nigeria have the right to ask for resources control and self-determination. It is a giant step forward," he added. He said after a seven-hour meeting Friday that the agreement would take effect immediately. "When there is a dialogue process the most important thing is that your grievances are addressed and that we discussed it. "You cannot get everything on the same day," he added, referring to the October 1 deadline set by his group for oil multinationals and foreigners to quit the Niger Delta. Fighting between the army and militias in the Niger Delta, which has been going on for more than a year, intensified in recent months. Violence escalated in August when the army launched attacks on rebel camps. Some 500 people have died in unrest in the region in recent weeks, according to Amnesty International, but the government said only 13 were killed. The unrest helped send oil prices on an upward spiral which saw them burst through the 50-dollar-a-barrel barrier on Tuesday, but drop back below the crucial mark when the peace talks began. They closed above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time in New York trading Friday, as traders fretted about Nigerian oil production amid the threatened rebel uprising. The government of Nigeria's Rivers State which borders Delta welcomed the ceasefire and disarmament agreement. "It is a welcome development. The peace deal is a follow-up to a previous initiative of the Rivpoverty and have benefitted little from the oil reserves in the region of creeks and mangrove swamps. Officials say Nigeria has earned over 360 billion dollars (290 billion euros) since oil was discovered in the southern Rivers State by Anglo-Dutch giant Shell in 1957. But today the country's external debts stand at a staggering 32 billion dollars. Despite the billions earned from oil, Nigeria, which on Friday celebrated the 44th anniversary of its independence from Britain, is listed among the 25 poorest countries in the world and placed 146th out of 162 on the United Nations Development Programme index of social indicators. On the World Health Organisation index the west African country occupies 186th position out of 192 member countries for the state of its health infrastructures.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SARAJEVO, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Bosnians vote Saturday in the third post-war local elections, which are expected to confirm the dominance of the ruling nationalist Croat, Muslim and Serb parties. Some 2.3 million Bosnians are eligible to elect municipal councils in 142 municipalities and 140 mayors. For the first time mayors will be elected directly in one round. Polling stations open at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) and were due to close at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT). First partial results are expected around midnight (2200 GMT). Three powerful nationalist parties -- the Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA), the Croat Democratic Union (HDZ), and the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) -- are likely to win in a majority of municipalities dominated by respective ethnic groups. The elections are likely to have the lowest turnout yet with surveys showing that only 49 percent of Bosnians would cast their ballots. Analysts say that a low turnout may benefit the three nationalist parties which have a stable electorate. Despite international calls to vote for reform the three nationalist parties, which led the 1992-95 war here, helped by a few minor allies, won general elections in 2002 and ended a brief rule of moderates. In the last April 2000 municipal elections, nationalists won in most municipalities although multi-ethnic Social Democrats gained control in mainly Muslim cities, including the capital Sarajevo. Nationalists' campaign focused on the still-winning card of "fear from other ethnic groups," rather than on municipal issues. Despite a series of reforms aimed at strengthening central institutions at the expense of entities' autonomy, the international community has warned that the reform process remains far too slow. With an unemployment rate of more than 40 percent Bosnia's economy is still recovering from the brutal war and has been kept afloat by an influx of 5.1 billion dollars of international aid over the past nine years. Post-war Bosnia consists of two semi-independent entities -- the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serbs' Republika Srpska.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Darleen Druyun, a former US Defense Department official charged in a deal that allowed her to get a job with Boeing after overseeing a controversial lease of Boeing tanker planes, was sentenced Friday to nine months in prison, officials said. Druyun, 56, had pleaded guilty earlier this year to a criminal conspiracy charge for her role in the deal that gave her a lucrative job with the aerospace company after she pressed for a lease agreement on refueling aircraft. A spokeswoman for the US Attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia, said Druyun's sentence also calls for seven months' community confinement after her release from prison, three years' probation, 150 hours of community service and a 5,000-dollar fine. "Darleen Druyun owed her primary allegiance to the American taxpayer. Instead she put her own personal interests ahead of the United States Air Force," US Attorney Paul McNulty said. Druyun, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition and management, helped negotiate the 2002 deal with the Boeing Company to lease 100 Boeing 767 tanker aircraft for the Air Force for more than 20 billion dollars. She accepted a job with Boeing in January 2003 as vice president and deputy general manager of missile defense systems. Prosecutors said Druyun's daughter, herself a Boeing employee, contacted a senior executive of Boeing in September 2002, setting in motion a process in which Druyun worked out a deal to retire from the Air Force and accept the senior position at Boeing. The scandal forced a high-level shakeup at Boeing and prompted fresh reviews of the lease plan, which some lawmakers criticized as a sweetheart deal for Boeing. The US Attorney's office said Druyun had admitted agreeing to a higher price for the 100 Boeing KC 767A tanker aircraft than she believed was appropriate, "in her view as a 'parting gift to Boeing,' and because of her desire to ingratiate herself with her future employer." It said she had also admitted giving Boeing "what at the time she considered to be proprietary pricing data supplied by another aircraft manufacturer. negotiating a higher settlement with Boeing for the NATO AWACS program than she believed appropriate," and favoring Boeing in other negotiations in 2000 and 2001. Boeing said those statements "came as a total surprise to the Boeing Company. "We have worked diligently with the US Attorney's office to investigate the circumstances of Ms. Druyun's hiring, and we will continue to do so," the company said in a statement. "Further, we will work with any and all government agencies that have concerns about the actions of Ms. Druyun or The Boeing Company." The statement quoted Boeing chief executive Harry Stonecipher as saying, "I have the highest confidence in the integrity and systems of The Boeing Company, and we will exert all energy to address any inadequacies that need to be corrected." Championed by the Air Force as a way to begin replacing its aging KC-135 fleet more quickly, the contract was fiercely opposed by Republican Senator John McCain and others, who said it would be more economical to purchase aircraft. In May, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put the plan on hold until further studies are completed in November. A Pentagon advisory board recently concluded there is no compelling material or financial reason to replace the Air Force's refueling jets. Some critics of the deal said the program should be reopened to allow Europe's Airbus, which lost out for the contract, to submit another bid.]]></c>

Those interests include investment in tourist infrastructure -- Abkhazia holds some of the most valuable beachfront real estate in the former Soviet Union -- and access to natural resources including metals, wood and fruit. The problem is that Georgia's youthful new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has made clear his intention to reunify his country that splintered with the collapse of the Soviet Union. And Saakashvili, a US-trained lawyer with close ties to Washington, has been blessed in that effort not just by the United States and other Western powers but also by international agreements that even Russia has signed onto. A declaration signed by Russia, the United States and many other countries at the close of a 1999 summit in Istanbul of the Organization for Security a in the ranks of the Georgian Communist Party and still retains cordial relations with members of Georgia's political elite, a fact which some analysts said makes him Tbilisi's favored candidate.

		<c><![CDATA[Serbian reformist President Boris Tadic and moderate-nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica have joined forces for the second round of local elections Sunday in a bid to stop ultra-nationalists taking power in cities throughout the country. Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) won some 30 percent of votes in the first round two weeks ago, while the hardline nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) trailed with some 27 percent. Their candidates face each other in a run-off for the mayor of Belgrade and most other Serbian towns. These are the first democratic local elections in Serbia since the ouster of nationalist strongman Slobodan Milosevic and his regime in October 2000. Supporters of Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), which won 14 percent of votes in the first round, are expected to back reformist candidates despite the strong rivalry between the DSS and the DS. After the first round on September 19, Tadic and Kostunica reached an agreement to form coalitions in local parliaments and battle together against the Radicals in the second round. This was the first such deal between the two parties since Tadic was elected president in June, but the fraught relations between the two democratic camps may make its application difficult. In the capital Belgrade, DS candidate Nenad Bogdanovic is favoured to defeat ultra-natio Vojvodina, in the north of Serbia, has recently been the scene of violence between the ethnic Serb and ethnic Hungarian communities.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Weld's raider to swallow up his Arc rivals by Pirate Irwin.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[They say a swallow doesn't make a summer but now that it is officially autumn there is no reason why Irish challenger Grey Swallow cannot take Europe's premier middle distance race the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp racecourse here on Sunday. The Irish Derby winner was as expected supplemented for the 1.6 million euro showpiece which bizarrely for a trainer of his stature Dermot Weld has never collected in his long and stellar career. A two-time Melbourne Cup winning trainer Weld believes his horse has the necessary qualities to see off what can only be described on paper at least as a true championship race. Aside from Grey Swallow the winners of the Epsom, French and German Derbies line up in the shape of North Light, Blue Canari and Shirocco respectively while Ouija Board, winner of the Epsom and Irish Oaks, and French Oaks champion Latice also saddle up for the run. There is also to add fuel to the fire France's most pre-eminent three year old colt in Bago, a three-time Group One winner but who is unproven over the mile-and-a-half distance while Godolphin provide just one runner in last year's Melbourne Cup disappointment Mamool. However judging by the way they miraculously improved the five-year-old Marienbard from a handicapper to an Arc winner two years ago one would be a fool to discount the Saeed bin Suroor charge's chances. Japan sends over a horse with impeccable credentials in the splendidly named Tap Dance City, however, the seven length winner of last year's Japan Cup has not had the easiest of voyages with a mix-up in Mexico City over his plane not arriving delaying his arrival till Friday. For a human to recover from the jetlag would be bad enough but a highly strung thoroughbred is another matter entirely and on that basis he is more there for the joy of his 100,000 strong syndicate of owners than anything else. Grey Swallow, though, has all the ingredients to be the winner as he made a valiant attempt to win the Irish Champion Stakes over two furlongs short of his ideal distance last time out and ended up an impressive fourth behind Azamour. Weld has had his mind set on the race since Grey Swallow put an admittedly injured North Light in his place at the Curragh in the summer. "He is ready, set and fired up to go,"said Weld. "He is a star but there are many other ones in the race so it is a case of the one that shines brightest on the day," he added. North Light has apparently bounced back well from his mid-season injury and his Barbados-born trainer Sir Michael Stoute believes he is poised to deliver him his first Arc winner after two runners-up spots with the gallant Pilsudski. "He has been working well on the gallops and while he may not have raced for a while it could be to his advantage as he will come into the race as fresh as a daisy," said the cricket-mad son of a former Barbados police chief, though one would have required a telescope to see where his p done Grey Swallow should land the trophy with Ouija Board to take second and Pride third in what should be a quite memorable Arc.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[VERONA, Italy, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The race towards cycling's rainbow jersey was hotting up here Friday with a decidedly Latin flavour dominating the blue riband event of the world cycling road race championships. Igor Astarloa and his Spanish teammate Oscar Freire know all about the prestige of wearing one of the sport's most prized jerseys. Freire, winner in Verona in 1999 and Lisbon in 2001, and reigning world champion Astarloa are surely the biggest threats for Olympic champion Paolo Bettini and his Italian team - now that Davide Rebellin is out of the picture. Rebellin, the reigning World Cup leader who earlier this season claimed a rare triple of classic victories in the Fleche Wallonne, the Amstel Gold Race and Liege-Bastogne-Liege, will not compete following the non-arrival Friday of a document that would have allowed him to compete for Argentina. The 33-year-old Gerolsteiner had in desperation gained Argentine citizenship after being left out the team by national selector Franco Ballerini. Rebellin's unexpected bad news may have been sweet music to the likes of Bettini. However the diminutive Italian who has twice come close to being world champion still has plenty to be concerned about given the arduous nature of the test ahead. Measuring a gruelling 265.5km it is more akin to a tough World Cup classic and with the cyclists having to tackle the three-kilometre Torricelle climb 18 times just finishing will be a respectable achievement. Fellow contender Alexandre Vinokourov will not have the kind of support enjoyed by Bettini, but he is still hoping for a podium place to add to the bronze he claimed behind Germany's Michael Rich and Australia's new time trial champion Michael Rogers three days ago. "After 250 kilometres, there will be less riders to worry about," said the Kazakh. Bettini, a two-time World Cup winner, came a frustrating fourth place last year and was second behind Freire in 2001. He is desperate to have it on his mantlepiece next to his gold medal from Athens and is everybody's favourite. However the 30-year-old Quick Step rider will have to fend off interest from his own team, which includes this year's Giro d'Italia winner Damiano Cunego. Saeco rider Cunego, along with up and coming Spaniard Alejandro Valverde, has been one of the sport's revelations this year having superbly held off his own team leader Gilberto Simoni to win the Giro d'Italia in June. The 23-year-old from Verona won the junior world title here in 1999 on a simimlar course, when Freire shook up the peloton's established order.opolis (J. Spencer. A O'Brien. 19), Bago (T. Gillet.

		<t><![CDATA[New director moves swiftly to put own team in at CIA by Jim Mannion (- ADDS details).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[CIA Director Peter Goss has moved swiftly to put in place a new leadership team at the US intelligence agency, replacing its executive director and naming two other people to senior advisory positions, US officials said Friday. The changes comes amid intense political pressure for an overhaul of the US intelligence establishment in response to the weaknesses exposed by the September 11, 2001 attacks and the war in Iraq. Goss replaced AB "Buzzy" Krongard as CIA executive director with Michael Kostiw, a former staffer of the House intelligence Committee, which Goss chaired before becoming CIA director a week ago, a US official said. The CIA executive director ranks third in CIA hierarchy, runs its day-to-day operations and is the most senior official dedicated solely to agency business. Also named to newly created jobs were Merrell Moorhead, as Goss' senior advisor for strategic programs, and Jay Jakub, senior advisor for operations and analysis, the official said. Like Kostiw, they are former intelligence committee staff members. Goss named Patrick Murray his chief of staff, bringing him from the House intelligence committee, where he also had served as chief of staff. The official noted it was not uncommon for a new CIA director to bring in his own team. "To talk about a shakeup is probably too much," the official said. But Goss's appointments, which were not publicly announced, cover broad areas of responsibility -- both within the CIA and in a larger intelligence community that includes military intelligence and agencies that collect and interpret imagery and signals. Jakub's appointment appears likely to become a source of tension with the CIA's director of operations, who is responsible for espionage, and its director of intelligence, who is responsible for analysis. "On the face of it, it's a pretty big job," said the US official. "But I wouldn't want you to think the deputy director of operations, or intelligence will report to the DCI through this genetleman." "This is sort of seen as a position that will strengthen the disciplines of analysis and collection operations community wide," the official said. A former staff director of the intelligence committee's subcommittee on human intelligence, Jakub was one of the authors of a highly critical report of the CIA human intelligence operations, the Washington Post reported. The Post, which first reported the personnel changes, said they sent tremors through the agency. "My hope is they don't come in and do a wholesale change that would do damage to a strategic effort that has produced excellent work on terrorism and a variety of other important issues," it quoted James Pavitt, the agency's former deputy director of operations, as saying. "Does it make a lot of sense to set the place on its head at a time when the nation is under a multitude of threats. They need to listen and learn first," Pavitt said. Deputy Director John McLaughlin, who had himself been considered for the top job, also has cautioned against a rush to reform the agency, as have other prominent former officials.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Group of Seven called on Argentina Friday to reach an agreement with its holder of bonds from its spectacular 2001 default, and to make economic reforms sought by the International Monetary Fund. The G7 statement, at the conclusion of a meeting of its finance ministers and central bankers, came as Argentina remained deadlocked with the IMF over economic measures and with most of its bondholders. "We urge the Argentine authorities to implement, as soon, as possible the prior actions required for the completion of the (IMF) Third Review while fulfilling its current obligations fully and timely," the statement said. "Argentina's key challenges remain structural reforms, building a sound fiscal framework, and achieving high creditor participation in a sustainable debt restructuring." The IMF recently gave Argentina a one-year extension on repaying 1.1 billion dollars in debt, but is pressing for more reforms and a better deal with bondholders before releasing new credits to the South American nation. Buenos Aires has proposed to pay off the debt at 25 percent of face value, a proposal that most creditors have rejected so far.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GAZA CITY, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two Palestinians died and four others were wounded in an Israeli air raid on the Jabaliya refugee camp in the north of the Gaza Strip, Palestinian security officials said Saturday. The two dead were members of the Islamic Jihad, an armed Islamic group, officials said. The deaths brought the toll since the start of the Palestinian uprising four years ago to 4,402, including 3,378 Palestinians and 953 Israelis, according to an AFP count. Since the start of Israeli army operation "Days of Penitence" in the northern Gaza Strip Tuesday aimed at stopping rocket attacks on Israeli territory 48 Palestinians have died. Earlier Friday seven Palestinians had been killed during a massive Israeli incursion into the northern Gaza Strip, as Washington urged Israel to use only proportionate force and bear in mind the consequences of their actions, while refusing to condemn the operation. The deaths came after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the army to step up Tuesday's raid. The latest campaign intensified after two Israeli toddlers were killed in Sderot, less than a kilometre (a mere half mile) across the Gaza border. The White House cautioned the staunchest US ally in the Middle East to "keep in mind the impact" of such actions on the peace process, while declining to condemn Israeli action. The US State Department called on Israel to use only "proportional force" in its military operations in Gaza and urged the Jewish state to avoid civilian casualties which it said complicated Middle East peace efforts. The Arab League has roundly condemned the incursions and criticized the international sponsors of the Middle East peace process for not speaking out.]]></c>

"That is probably the best performance of the season and I am really happy for the fans. They were absolutely brilliant during the game, the best I have seen them, and it was great to get the win for them. Rangers now join Hearts, who defeated Portuguese side Braga, in the new group stage of the UEFA Cup, said to be worth around five million pounds for the clubs who have qualified. McLeish was delighted for Scottish football that the Edinburgh side had also qualified, but said he would be setting his sights higher than just taking part in the group. "It has been a terrific night for the Scottish game with the Hearts win and it gives everyone a boost," he said. "There are a lot of quality teams in the competition but we want to give it our best shot. We want to progress in Europe and we will possibly look at bringing more players in to the Rooney is not on that list," said the Swede. "At Euro 2004, he was one of the best players, if not the best. Is he a genuine candidate. I think so. But suddenly when you talk in those terms, the competition is very high." Eriksson witnessed Rooney's spectacular Champions Leage hat-trick for United against Fenerbahce on Tuesday and admitted he was stunned by the teenager's performance. "I was very surprised as he hadn't played for so long. I know that he can play at that level, but I don't think anyone expected it in his first Champions League game. That was remarkable."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Middlesbrough come face-to-face with Manchester United and Wayne Rooney on Sunday but they will have their own teenage sensation to show off at Old Trafford. Like Rooney, James Morrison is also just 18 and the midfielder was the talk of the Riverside after his last minute equaliser against Banik Ostrava in the UEFA Cup on Thursday. "James couldn't have done any better," said Middlesbrough manager Steve McLaren. "I knew that he could do the job and he worked very hard. He showed great composure at the end to tuck his goal away. "I just wish James had put the other chance away beforehand so that we could have relaxed a little earlier." The first round, second leg tie in the Czech Republic ended 1-1 as Boro went through to the next stage 4-1 on aggregate. "It's just fantastic for James," skipper Gareth Southgate told the Evening Gazette newspaper. "Scoring a goal is everything he could have wished for, but he is a level-headed lad and he will keep his feet on the ground. "He did an excellent job besides the goal and he could not have done any more to stake his claim for another chance."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair has abandoned plans to endorse Gordon Brown, his powerful chancellor of the exchequer, as his successor, Blair allies were quoted Saturday as saying. Blair, who underwent a benign heart operation after announcing Thursday he wanted to stay for one last term, will not try to anoint his successor when he stands down, The Independent newspaper quoted aides as saying. Blair's announcement for another term was seen as aimed at clarifying his plans after he had to undergo the operation to correct an irregular heart beat that has returned since he was first treated for it a year ago. Aides were quoted as telling the daily that Blair might have quit around now if Brown had not "reneged" on a deal to support him in a final year in office so that he could secure his legacy. In November last year the prime minister discussed his exit strategy with Brown, and in return for a pledge of loyalty and support from Brown, Blair promised to stand down late this year and help Brown achieve his long-held ambition to succeed him, the newspaper said. Blair's allies said the deal collapsed because the prime minister believed the chancellor was being "obstructive" and "destabilizing." They cited opposition to university tuition fees by Brown allies as well as Brown's role in forcing Blair to concede a referendum on the European Union constitution, and a string of treasury objections to five-year plans for education, health, crime and transportation. The Brown camp denies any disloyalty, the daily said. But an unnamed cabinet minister was quoted as saying that "Gordon made a bad miscalculation. Tony was prepared for a smooth handover if Gordon helped him achieve what he wanted him to do. That support was not forthcoming; he tried to block every move." When Blair announced his decision Thursday to seek a full third term but not a fourth one, he said Brown would be very capable of succeeding him. But a Downing Street source told the Independent that it was the party's job and not his to name a successor. The paper added that Blair's move will be seen as a snub to Brown.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Vancouver film festival includes surfeit of anti-Bush documentaries by Michel Comte.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[VANCOUVER, Canada, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[There is no shortage of political documentaries sharply critical of US President George W. Bush and his war on terrorism at the Vancouver International Film Festival this year. The festival has a long tradition of giving audiences large doses of reality, and there are no fewer than 100 documentary films being screened here this week reflecting on America's push to change the world since the September 11 2001 attacks. Among them are alf-dozen that take direct aim at Bush and his foreign policies. "This is definitely the year of the political activist documentary," said festival director Alan Franey. "There is a sense of urgency for many to come to terms with some very thorny issues like globalization, America's place in the world, or how to combat terrorism," said Franey. "And, people are hungry for good information." He said documentaries no longer rely on talking heads, or make spectacular efforts at objectivity kto the point of being dry, to the delight of audiences. But, critics may aptly denounce the barrage of political films released in the US presidential election year because many rely on the same facts and interviews to reach the same unproven conclusions. "You might ask: 'Where are all the pro-Bush films.'" said Franey. "But art almost never feels its role is to justify the exercise of power. Very few film-makers make films to be cheerleaders. "Still, it's pretty disgraceful how unmodulated a lot of people's reasoning is on some of these issues," he added. "Nobody really knows what the outcome will be of America's intervention in Iraq. I'm not convinced absolutely that it was the wrong thing to do." In "Hijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear and the Selling of American Empire", directors Jeremy Earp and Sut Jhally lump US Vice President Dick Cheney, Attorney General John Ashcroft, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, into the category, ""chicken hawks," a play on the neo-conservative label, "hawks." French director William Karel's "The World According to Bush" offers a more rigorous and objective, less demagogical view of the US response to 9/11 than Michael Moore's award-winning "Fahrenheit 9/11", but is no less damning. He uses clips of writer Norman Mailer, former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix and US Secretary of State Colin Powell, examining the Bush family ties to the Saudi royal family, and illustrating how fundamentalist religious beliefs played a part in administration policy. The film was turned down by the Cannes Film Festival because it had already accepted Moore's entry and did not want to appear anti-American. And, Baghdad blogger Salam Pax gives audiences a glimpse of the new Iraq since the removal of Saddam Hussein in his Video Reports from Iraq, taking a pro-American outlook but failing to deliver the promised "democracy, whiskey and sex." The 30-year-old Shiite Muslim gained fame with his popular online diary that chronicled the invasion of Baghdad in 2002 and subsequent US occupation, written from a suburb of the city. Other international premiers include "Until When" by director Dahna Abourahme, about Palestinians living in the Dhiesheh refuge camp outside of Bethlehem. Also here are John Michalczyk's "Different Drummers: Daring to Make Peace in the Middle East" about diverse Israelis working for peace despite their government, and Adi Ardel's "Lullaby" which has Jewish and Muslim mothers talking about losses and grief in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MANCHESTER, England, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson will not wrap wonderboy striker Wayne Rooney in cotton wool, the Old Trafford coach said Friday. "I don't anticipate having a harder time managing the expectation around Wayne than anyone else I have had at the club," said the United boss. "It is a straightforward situation. He will get the same treatment as all the other young players and I am sure he will appreciate that." The 18-year-old Rooney made a stunning United debut against Fenerbahce in the Champions League on Tuesday when he hammered in a hat-trick. But having guided the careers of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Paul Scholes, Ferguson will ensure Rooney and fellow talented teenager Cristiano Ronaldo are allowed to develop at their own pace. That could mean the former Everton star beginning Sunday's match against Middlesbrough on the bench. Ferguson was forced to admit Rooney's performance on Tuesday night was something special. "It was a marvellous feat," said the Scotsman. "You have to play it in the context of how many hat-tricks are scored in total during a season. "But the main thing now is to let the boy enjoy his football. There are a lot of young lads at the club in his age group like Cristiano Ronaldo, Darren Fletcher, David Bellion and John O'Shea and hopefully he can grow up with them and be with them for a long time." If Ferguson does decide to take Rooney out of the firing line on Sunday, top scorer Alan Smith will be the man to step in after sitting out the last three games. While Louis Saha has trained all week, the French international's recovery from a knee injury has not quite come quick enough for him to come into consideration for the encounter with Steve McClaren's men.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Armed intelligence officers raided the Amsterdam home of Paul Bigley, the brother of British hostage Ken Bigley, in the hunt for the leader of the Arab group believed to be holding him, a newspaper said Saturday. An intelligence officer from the Foreign Office is alleged to have accompanied the Dutch intelligence officers during Friday's raid, the Independent newspaper reported. The officers seized Bigley's computer and interrogated him about his alleged contacts with Tawhid and Jihad group, which is led by Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, which has claimed responsibility for the car bombings that claimed the lives of at least 35 children, the daily said. Material from Bigley's computer hard-disk was downloaded and sent back for analysis in Britain and he was also forced to make a five-page statement, the daily said. Paul Bigley angrily denied he had any direct contacts with the group, it added. In a videotape broadcast on the satellite news channel Al-Jazeera on Wednesday, Kenneth Bigley appeared shackled in a cage imploring British Prime Minister Tony Blair to save his life. Dressed in orange overalls, an exhausted-looking and unshaven Bigley was heard accusing Blair of "lying" about negotiations for his release, and insisting his kidnappers did not want to kill him. Bigley was seized September 16 from his Baghdad home, along with two US colleagues who were beheaded by their captors last week. He accused London of refusing to negotiate to save his life and pleaded directly to Blair to work for the release of Iraqi women prisoners, a key condition set for his release. Blair responded to the video by saying London was doing everything possible to secure Bigley's release, but insisted that the kidnappers had not made contact with the British authorities. Bigley's son Craig read a statement from the family thanking the captors for allowing them to see his father alive, and renewed their plea for his release. Meanwhile, Bigley's younger brother Paul said he was now "100-percent" certain that a message posted Tuesday on the Internet announcing his brother's imminent release was authentic.]]></c>

The 1-0 defeat at Olympiakos was Liverpool's third away defeat of the season but Kewell insists that Rafael Benitez's men are eager to make up for that loss. "We know it's going to be tough but there's no way we're going there scared of Chelsea. They're a good team but then so are we," Kewell told the official Liverpool website. "I know it's a cliche but it's eleven against eleven on Sunday and if we play well we know we can get a result. What happened in Greece in midweek was disappointing and we all felt a bit down after that game. "But we have worked hard in training all week and we can make amends on Sunday." Kewell also has a personal point to prove on Sunday after he was left on the bench in Athens. "I know what I can do and I am confident in my own ability. It's been an up and down season for me so far but I know I can offer an awful lot more. "The criticism I've had doesn't bother me. It never has done. There are always people who want to have a go at me but it's water off a duck's back now. "I'm my own worst critic and I always know when I'm performing well and performing not so well. I know the quality I can produce and I'm working towards reaching my best level."]]></c>

Bradley, who counts the Cheltenham Gold Cup among a clutter of big race victories, will be banned from entering any racecourse or premises owned, used or licensed by the Jockey Club which governs British racing as from Saturday. Now a bloodstock agent Bradley will also be barred from dealing in any capacity with a racehorse. Bradley had claimed that the April 2003 disqualification order following proceedings before the Jockey Club's disciplinary committee and appeal board was unlawful. But judge Mr Justice Richards said he rejected the challenge to the appeal board's decision "and to the implementation of that decision by the Jockey Club". He said that "at the end of the day I accept the Jockey Club's fundamental submission that in the circumstances of the case a five year period of disqualification was on any view a proportionate and lawful penalty". Bradley's legal team are considering the verdict before deciding whether to make a further attempt to overturn the ban with an application to the court of Appeal. The Jockey Club welcomed the ruling. John Maxse, public relations director of the Jockey Club, said: "It is important for horseracing that its regulator, the Jockey Club, is able to police the sport effectively. "We should be able to issue appropriate penalties where the offence and the evidence warrant it. "Mr Justice Richards has concluded that the Jockey Club's disciplinary and appeal process in the case of Graham Bradley, had resulted in a penalty which was 'proportionate and lawful' and he endorses our procedures. "The findings will assist the Jockey Club in carrying out its vital duties in upholding the integrity of the sport." Bradley was ordered to pay the costs of his appeal. The ban was imposed in the wake of Bradley's appearance at Southampton Crown Court in September 2001 when he gave evidence at the trial of a friend who was later acquitted of drugs charges. During his evidence, he stated that he had received presents in the form of nights out and the occasional flight, and cash payments, from a man called Brian Wright in return for privileged racing information.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Wall Street rebounded this week as investors showed confidence in the US economy despite high oil prices, but the market could stagnate next week ahead of the highly anticipated monthly US unemployment report. In the week to Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.45 percent to 10,192.65, while the Standard and Poor's 500 broad-market index gained 1.93 percent to close at 1,131.50 The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged by 3.34 percent to 1,942.20. The market moved up after dropping last week. Investors shrugged off a surge in oil prices, with the New York contract closing at 50.12 dollars, the first time it finished the day above 50 dollars. It reached a record 50.47 dollars in New York earlier in the week. Investors have confidence in the economy and are not worried about the rise in oil prices because it does not believe it will last, said Owen Fitzpatrick, a Deutsche Bank broker. After dropping 1.6 percent last week, Nasdaq rallied thanks to key upgrades and news that PeopleSoft dumped chief executive Craig Conway, possibly clearing the way for a takeover by Oracle, and further consolidation. PeopleSoft closed up 2.98 dollars, or 15 percent, at 22.83 dollars while Oracle's stock rose 62 cents, or 5.5 percent, to 11.90 dollars. Analyst Art Hogan of Jefferies and Co. said it was too early to say for sure that the ouster of Conway clears the way for a merger with Oracle, but Wall Street appears to be seeing it that way. "The obvious interpretation is that this makes the deal more doable," Hogan said. Hogan expected to see strength in the software sector on anticipation of more merger activity. "If this deal happens, its starts the daisy chain of a whole lot more merger and acquisition activity," he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up despite pharmaceutical giant Merck's announcement Thursday of a global withdrawal of its blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx. Merck stock plunged 27 percent after the surprise withdrawal. The week was marked by mostly upbeat economic news including better-than-expected August figures for new home sales and construction spending. The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, while falling to 58.5 percent in September from 59.0 percent in August, still showed strong growth. "You can't have a strong manufacturing sector without decent underlying economic fundamentals," said Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisors. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 4.191 percent from 4.031 percent late Friday and that on the 30-year bond to 4.949 percent from 4.811 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. Next Friday, investors will watch unemployment and job creation figures for September. Analysts expect 153,000 new jobs. Other indicators will come out next week, including the ISM's index for service sector activity, which is expected to have risen by 59 points in September against 58.2 the preceding month. Factory orders are expected to have risen by 0.3 percent in August.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A 26-year-old Mexican man stabbed a prostitute 77 times after she made fun of him when he was unable to have an erection, police said Friday. The man paid the 36-year-old prostitute 20 dollars late Thursday, but the suspect was unable to have sex with her in this city 420 kilometers (261 miles) northwest of Mexico City, police said. The man, who had consumed alcohol and cocaine, told police he picked up a knife resting on the night table and stabbed the mother of six repeatedly for three minutes. Police found her body Friday. "In that moment I only thought about killing her because I was afraid she would denounce me for being addicted to cocaine," he said in his statement to police.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Kerry camp dares to dream after robust debate by Stephen Collinson.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ORLANDO, Florida, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[In 24 hours, John Kerry's political braintrust went from talking up a stumbling campaign, to playing down soaring hopes after pundits and polls handed him the first presidential debate. The veteran senator's strong showing in Thursday's nailbiting faceoff against President George W. Bush injected a palpable jolt of enthusiasm through his camp. Activists, supporters and jaded campaign workers, who endured a miserable six weeks while Bush pounded Kerry over Iraq, the Democrat's military record was ripped in Republican friendly advertising, looked to the sprint up to the November 2 polls with new hope. And Kerry himself appeared loose, edging away from the often stiff and starchy performances on the stump at two rallies in the crucial swing-state of Florida, hours after his clash with Bush at the University of Miami. Though he was preaching to the choir, Kerry coaxed his audience along, changing the tone and volume of his voice, at times playing the statesman, and others the stand-up comic. In previous months, Kerry's booming but boring style of delivery -- compared by one wit to a man hailing a ship, has provided rich fodder for opponents. But the watchword Friday, from the top down was: no complacency, especially as the veteran Massachusetts Senator went into the debate trailing Bush between five and eight percent in most polls. "Oh, no, no, no, let me make it clear to everybody, we have to win every day between now and November 2," Kerry told near delirious partisans at a rally in Tampa. Joe Lockhart, former White House press secretary who joined Kerry to try to bring some Clintonian finesse to his campaign, struck a similar note. "Winning the debate does not mean winning the election," he said on MSNBC. Another former Clinton White House press spokesman, Mike McCurry, also dampened down expectations that the debate would spark an immediate spike in Kerry's opinion poll ratings. But he argued that Kerry strategists were encouraged at anecdotal evidence that the "internal dynamic" of the race was changing, just a month before polling day. "We believe people are taking a new, fresh look, and that's a very important achievement for us in the debate." But while the pundits and pollsters plumped for Kerry after the debate, which saw Bush at times irritated at his challenger's prosecutorial line of questioning, it remains uncertain how much the race has changed. Bush can count on a firm political base of conservative voters, and has won high regard from less ideological Americans over his leadership in the global anti-terror campaign, despite doubts over his conduct on Iraq. And the Kerry camp can be sure that Bush's formidable campaign team which boasts brains like Karl Rove and Karen Hughes will send their man out in the ring with fresh ammunition in the next debate on Friday. Four years ago, Al Gore was widely declared the winner of the first presidential debate on the night, but when the Republican spin machine and the cable news pundits got to work and exposed his histrionic sighs, Bush emerged ahead when the smoke cleared. And should Kerry at not enjoy at least a hop up in opinion polls, his supporters may find themselves lapsing into gloom again -- because if he can't challenge Bush countrywide after apparently winning a debate -- his campaign strategists might just be out of options.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Group of Seven finance chiefs called on oil producers for help Friday in keeping energy prices manageable as they pledged action to alleviate the debt burden on poor countries and renent banks and urged other wealthy nations to follow suit. But Britain's G7 partners have different approaches to debt relief. The ministers also reterated their insistence on greater exchange rate flexibility, which they said was "desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the international financial system. " The appeal was directed primarily at China, which has come under increased G7 pressure to abandon its practice of pegging its currency to the dollar. Government and business leaders in the United States and elsewhere contend that the peg undervalues the yuan, making Chinese exports cheaper -- and more competitive -- while increasing the cost of foreign goods in the Chinese market. The US Treasury Department earlier announced that Chinese officials, who were to dine with their G7 counterparts later in the day, had agreed to move "firmly and steadily" toward a more flexible positions of the different parties have come much closer together even if there are still some differences," Sarkozy told AFP. "Everyone agrees that Iraq needs help to get out of its present situation and everyone agrees that a solution must be found by the end of the year. Now we have to work out the percentage of the debt reduction," he said. The United States and Britain seek a 95-percent debt reduction, while France, Germany and Russia favour a 50-percent cut.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[G7 worried about oil, but has little power: analysts by Rob Lever.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Group of Seven leaders are worried about high oil prices derailing the global economy, but have little means to influence the marketplace, analysts say. G7 finance ministers and central bankers, in a statement following talks Friday, suggested that oil prices -- which closed above 50 dollars for the first time Friday -- appear to be the main risk to an otherwise strong global economy. "Oil prices remain high and are a risk," the G7 said. "We call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate." "Right now, oil prices are causing an economic headwind," said US Treasury Secretary John Snow after the G7 talks. "The geopolitics of oil, and current uncertainties, are causing a short-term phenomenon. The finance ministers and I are committed to promoting policy reforms in each of our countries to speed the return of more reasonable costs." But analysts said most of the factors are beyond the control of the G7, which represents the seven richest industrial countries. "The problem is that oil markets are tight as a drum and demand is growing faster than supply," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at the economic research firm Global Insight. "It's not as if OPEC is manipulating the market. There's really not much anybody can do until the investments now being made bring some fruit." Behravesh said the G7 is concerned, however: "If oil prices stay at this level or move higher it could derail the global economy." Joseph Quinlan, economist at Bank of America, said it would be a stretch to think the G7 can "jawbone" the oil markets. "I think the oil market will change when global growth slows," he said. "The G7 can be effective in currency markets but they have no real history in the oil markets." Behravesh agreed, but said the G7 nonetheless wanted to express its concern about a major risk to global economic growth. "Clearly they're worried, and I think this reflects a worry about how much oil prices will affect growth. But it's not that the G7 has much influence. They don't." In an effort to show a balanced view, the G7 statement also called on consumer nations to increase energy efficiency and called for more transparence in global markets by getting more information about supply and demand, principally through the International Energy Agency. The statement came after New York crude oil futures closed at their highest level ever. The light sweet crude November futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed up 48 cents at 50.12 dollars a barrel, posting a record close, on the latest Nigerian worries. In London, the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November rose 24 cents to close up at 46.62 dollars a barrel. Marshall Steeves, analyst at Refco, said high oil prices affect many countries, not just the G7. "Western economies like the US and the EU might not be as sensitive because they are not energy intensive anymore," he said. "In Asia it might have a stronger impact, in particular in China and India, which have become more manufacturing-based economies."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[US urges China to move more quickly on currency reform (RECASTS, leading on Snow comments).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Treasury Secretary John Snow urged China Friday to act more decisively to implement a flexible exchange rate hours after his department announced that Chinese officials had promised to move "firmly and steadily" toward easing their currency policy. "Sustained, non-inflationary growth in China is important for maintaining strong global growth, and a more flexible and market-based. exchange rate is an important part of achieving this goal," Snow told reporters following talks here between Group of Seven finance chiefs and their Chinese counterparts. "I have been encouraged by some of the advances that have ocurred. Tonight I underscored that I would like to see China move more quickly." Snow's appeal came after the US Treasury Department said in a statement that at a meeting Thursday of US and Chinese officials Beijing reaffirmed its "commitment to further advance reform and to push ahead firmly and steadily to a market-based flexible exchange rate." Finance Minister Jin Renqing and the head of the Chinese central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, joined counterparts at a dinner following a meeting of the Group of Seven countries, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. It was the first appearance at a G7 gathering of senior Chinese officials and was seen as belated recognition by the major industrialized powers of China's stature in the world economy. The United States and its G7 partners have made no secret of their displeasure with the Chinese currency's dollar peg, which they say artificially weakens the cost of Chinese exports -- making them more competitive -- while increasing the cost of imported goods in China. A newly formed US labor, industry and farm alliance, the China Currency Coalition, maintains that Chinese imports in the United States are undervalued by 40 percent and US exports to China overvalued by the same figure. US Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Sander Levin dismissed the reported Chinese offer as nothing new and said Washington had failed to extract "concrete action" from Beijing. "Contrary to comments by administration and Chinese officials, it is not accurate to say that China's promise to move 'firmly and steadily to a market-based flexible exchange rate' is a 'new policy,'" they argued in a letter to Snow. "In fact, it is merely a re-statement of the same rhetoric that China has issued for at least five years." Outside US government circles, analysts likewise suggested that China's statement of intent would not lead to any near-term action. "I think China will pay lip service," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at the research firm Global Insight. "But it's not clear if a currency realignment is in China's best interest now." Added Joseph Quinlan, a Bank of America economonomic instability," said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley investment bank. The G7 meeting "could serve the useful purpose of setting the stage for the truly important debate to come -- in effect, framing the Chinese conundrum in a broader macro context," Roach added. "China needs that. So does a China-centric Asia. And so does the rest of an increasingly integrated, yet woefully unbalanced, global economy."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[G7 calls for more debt relief for poorest nations by Rob Lever (ADDS details, reax).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Group of Seven industrial powers called Friday for more debt relief for the world's poorest nations, but stopped short of endorsing a specific plan for writing off debt. "We are now committed to addressing the sustainability of debt of the poorest countries by making progress on debt relief and grant financing," said a statement issued after a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bankers. The statement stopped short of endorsing a proposal by Britain to write off its share of debt and avoided any mention of a call for a 100-percent writeoff of poor nations' debt, sought by some activists. In poverty reduction efforts, the G7 said, "There is a need for additional financial aid grounded on the principles of good policies, debt sustainability, accounting for results, and enhancing predictability and aid effectiveness." Two groups pressing for a full writeoff of debt to the poorest countries criticized the G7 for a lack of action. "The G7 have chosen to delay debt cancellation that could have put 100 million children into school," said Oxfam's Max Lawson. "Once again rich countries have turned up with their notebooks not their checkbooks, and the price will be paid by the world's poorest people." "Rich countries' delay in breaking the log-jam on debt leaves the poorest countries paying out 100 million dollars a day that could be spent on health and education. The poor cannot wait," said Patrick Watt of Action Aid. On Sunday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said his Labour government will unilaterally write off its share of debts owed to the World Bank and other development banks, and urged other wealthy nations to follow. The move provided fresh impetus to a movement to press the G7 along with the IMF and World Bank to find a way to wipe out the debts that are crushing many poor nations. But the rest of the G7, which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, have different ideas. One plan to tax international capital flows, advocated by presidents Jacques Chirac of France and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, has been rejected by some G7 nations, notably the United States. Germany, meanwhile, has resisted efforts for a writeoff of debt. The International Monetary Fund this week announced a two-year extension of a debt-relief initiative for poor countries that was scheduled to end this year, known as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative. Twenty-seven countries have debt relief packages in place, which the fund said were worth about 32 billion dollars in net present-value terms. Fourteen of the 27 have fulfilled the necessary conditions and have actually begun to receive debt relief. But critics say this effort is too slow and cumbersome, and that more urgent relief is needed, arguing that the wealthy nations need to livone last full term, the Financial Times said. If Blair stays on until 2009, Brown will be 59 years old and "younger figures now seem better placed to take over the leadership," it said. Most pundits believe Blair's Labour party would win elections expected in May next year. Blair, who was first elected prime minister in 1997, would top Conservative Margaret Thatcher's record for longevity in office. Blair's announcement for one more full term was seen as aimed at clarifying his plans after he had to undergo the heart operation. Columnists have said he still risks appearing like a "lame duck" by setting a date for his exit. The Independent newspaper quoted Blair allies meanwhile as saying that the premier had now abandoned plans to hand over to Brown, who was in Washington when the news broke of Blair's plans for a third term and medical procedure. A Brown aide told the Guardian newspaper: "It's like an African coup. They waited until (Brown) was out of the countrter was quoted as saying that "Gordon made a bad miscalculation. Tony was prepared for a smooth handover if Gordon helped him achieve what he wanted him to do. That support was not forthcoming; he tried to block every move." When Blair announced his decision Thursday to seek a full third term but not a fourth one, he said Brown would be very capable of succeeding him. But a Downing Street source told the Independent that it was the party's job and not his to name a successor. The paper added that Blair's move will be seen as a snub to Brown. Brown meanwhile was portrayed in British newspapers as putting on a brave face while attending annual meetings of the G-7 leading industrial nations and the International Monteary Fund in Washington. "The thoughts of all of us must be the prime minister's well being," Brown was quoted as saying. With his wife Cherie at his side, Blair checked into Hammersmith Hospital in west London for a relatively routine operation to restore his heart rhythm, requiring only local anesthetic and a couple of hours on the operating table. Several hours later, he was back at Downing Street, his official residence, smiling and looking relaxed. He was to rest for the weekend before embarking on an official visit to Ethiopia next week. "I'm absolutely fine, thanks," he said. In a statement, Hammersmith Hospital said: "The procedure was successful in eliminating the atrial flutter. We consider the risk of recurrence of the problem to be very low." Blair was first treated for the problem a year ago.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Fear and hope as Afghan refugees register for homeland vote by Bronwyn Curran.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[By dust-blown railway tracks at the edge of this desert-ringed Pakistani city, Afghan refugees juggle fear and hope as they line up to register for their homeland's first presidential vote. At a nearby teashop, a pair of black-turbanned Afghan Taliban supporters scorn the would-be voters' nervous enthusiasm, saying they should be taking part in "jihad" or holy war against "US-Jew occupiers" instead of the October 9 elections. Apprehension, dreams and bitter threats dwell side-by-side in Quetta's Ghousabad refugee colony, a mixture of pro-Taliban Pashtun hardliners, moderate Pashtuns and anti-Taliban Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras. Almost 400 registration stations have been set up for refugees in this southwest city, 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Afghan border. Organisers anticipate a total of 600,000 to 800,000 refugees will register at 1,670 booths in Quetta, northwest Peshawar, capital Islamabad and camps along the border this weekend. "I will go home if peace is returned through these elections. I pray to God these polls will be the base for peace and tranquility in Afghanistan," said Abdullah, 59, signing up for a voter's card in a brightly coloured nomads' tent in Ghousabad. He fled northern Afghanistan 21 years ago and is waiting on the poll's outcome to make his long-awaited pilgrimage home. Abdullah has heard the threats of violence on radio and read them in Taliban-signed pamphlets distributed among refugee communities. "There are some who say 'Don't go and vote, don't participate.' But I am nobody's servant. I'm independent. I fear God, I don't fear these people." Abdullah's bravado isn't shared by the 20-year-old student at his side, Najibullah, who was born in a refugee camp and has never seen his native home. "We are afraid something will happen on voting day," he told AFP. "There's been so many threats and I'm worried that the situation is not under control." Quetta swarms with the students and teachers of dozens of Koranic schools, some of which serve as breeding and recruiting grounds for Taliban commanders waging attacks in Afghanistan, according to Afghan authorities. President Hamid Karzai last year named several key Taliban commanders he believed were living freely in Quetta. Black-bearded men with kohl-etched eyes, heads swathed in thick turbans of black or white with long scarves trailing down their backs, stroll through Quetta's streets and amble by on pushbikes. On Fridays, Islam's day of rest and prayer, they gather in the Satellite Town park to wrestle, kick footballs, and eat sweets, rolling out mats at sunset to pray together in rows facing Mecca. At the Ghousabad teashop former Afghan Taliban fighters Abdul Hamid and Mohammad Nasim, draped in black turbans and smocks, cite the Koran as they rail against Afghanistan's first direcee student. "Pamphlets threatening voters with death keep appearing. On the ground, in our homes. But I'm not afraid. God is merciful, and we are working for our homeland." Najibullah, Haji Abdul and Abdullah share the fervent belief that the elections will bring to their shattered homeland the peace they have made a prerequisite for going home. "Everyone who came here today was very excited," said Haji Mohammad Shah, a supervisor at one of Quetta's registration centers. "Their attitude was 'we're getting the opportunity to elect a leader who will lead Afghanistan out of its troubles."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Mahatma Gandhi had intense friendship with British admiral's daughter: book.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW DELHI, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Mahatma Gandhi, India's apostle of peace whose 135th birth anniversary was being marked Saturday, had an intense secret friendship with a British admirer, according to a new book. "Mira and the Mahatma," by Indian psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar, explores what appears to have been a close but platonic relationship between Gandhi and Madeline Slate, daughter of a British admiral, who left Britain in 1925 at the age of 33 and travelled to India to be with Gandhi, then 56. The book, which has stirred controversy among Gandhi's legions of admirers, describes the relationship as a "violent and passionate disturbance" in the life of a man who had opted for celibacy and was busy seeking to wrest India's freedom from British rule. While the book, published in India by Penguin, is a fictionalised account of the friendship, Kakar said it relies heavily on 350 letters from Gandhi to Slate from 1925-1930 and 1940-1942 that are in the Nehru Memorial Museum Library in New Delhi. He said Slate's letters to Gandhi, however, were lost as the Indian leader had the habit of recycling every piece of paper to use it to write on. Kakar said he believed Slate was "in love with the spiritual side of Gandhi. "There was no physical consummation of love between the two or even the mention of 'I love you'," Kakar told AFP. The book has outraged Gandhi admirers who say it distorts the relationship between Slate and Gandhi. It "was totally spiritual -- as between a teacher and a disciple which others can not understand. It was not on a human plane," said Nirmala Deshpande, 75. "The book is based on total untruth." Between criss-crossing the country on his crusade to win independence, finally achieved in 1947, Gandhi wrote letters and notes to vast numbers of people including Slate, who lived at his commune at Sabarmati in western India's Gujarat state. He renamed Slate "Mira" -- the mythical shepherdess and lover of the Hindu god Krishna. "You are on the brain. I look about me and miss you, I open the charkha (spinning wheel) and miss you. " Gandhi wrote to Mira during one of their many periods of separation. In another letter, he said he loved translating Indian hymns into English for her. "In translating the hymns for you, I am giving myself much joy. Have I not expressed my love, often in storms than in gentle, soothing showers of affection." he wrote. At one time, when Gandhi was about to begin a week-long fast, he gave her a note that read: "Mira, I shall not see you for a week. I shall miss our evenings together but I must not get attached to them." Kakar said he believed Gandhi felt uncomfortable with the strength of his feelings for her. "I think when she got too near him, it caused him stress. He looked at her as a danger. He was very, very close to her. He missed her when she was away. But as far as I know, there was nothing sexual," he said. Gandhi married at the age of 13 but is reputed to have decided in his mid-30s, after siring four sons, that sex was at the root of all impulses that must be mastered to pursue a godly life and to have opted for celibacy. The book is the second to be released about Gandhi recently. Another, "Gandhi's Prisoner. The Life of Gandhi's Son, Manilal," written by his great-granddaughter Uma Dhuphelia-Mesthrie in South Africa, portrays the world's famed preacher of non-violence as an iron-fisted father to his son. Slate was away from the commune when Gandhi was shot dead in 1948 by a Hindu fanatic and left India in 1958. She settled in a town near Vienna and refused to speak to anyone about Gandhi, believing his legacy had been forsaken. She devoted herself instead to her passion for Beethoven and died in 1982.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Steve Pate fired a seven-under par 65 here Friday to join fellow American Harrison Frazar atop the leaderboard after the second round of the three million-dollar PGA Southern Farm Bureau Classic. Frazar, who began the day level for the lead with compatriot Glen Day and Australian John Senden, fired a 67 to stand on 12-under par 132 after 36 holes at an event lacking most of golf's greatest names. Tiger Woods and most top stars are at the World Golf Championships event in Ireland, leaving only one of the world's top 50 players at this US tour stop. Frazar's round featured two birdies, two bogeys and two eagles, including a birdie on the par-5 fifth hole for the second consecutive day. Pate carded a bogey-free round with seven birdies, five coming on the back nine. Senden fired a 68 to stand one stroke behind the leaders along with Americans Patrick Sheehan and Chris Couch, who fired 10 birdies in a nine-under 63 round. Couch's only bogey, at the par-4 sixth hole, kept him off the pace. Day fired a 70 to share sixth with six others, including Aussie Greg Chalmers. Colombia's Camilo Villegas and American Woody Austin each fired 64s to stand on 134 after sharing 87th when the day began. Villegas had seven birdies, an eagle and a bogey. Austin, who won the Buick Championship at the end of August but missed the cut in his next two starts, drained 11 birdies.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[AUCKLAND, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A 78-year-old man Friday became the latest to face sex abuse allegations on the remote British Pacific colony of Pitcairn Island, founded more than 200 years ago by mutineers, media on the island reported. Len Brown was facing trial in a make-shift court room on two charges of rape of a woman in incidents between 1969 and 1972, Radio New Zealand reported. His son, Dave Brown, 49, the previous day pleaded not guilty to 15 sexual abuse charges, including assault of a five-year-old. The island's mayor, Steven Christian, 53, is on trial on six charges of rape and four of indecent assault on the island of just 47 people half way between New Zealand and South America. Seven of the island's 12 adult men are charged with a total of 55 sex crimes, some dating back 40 years and will face individual trials heard by three New Zealand judges appointed by the previously dormant Court of Pitcairn. Complainants, speaking on video links from New Zealand, have this week described the island as "a living hell" where men used women as they pleased. Television New Zealand quoted prosecutor Christine Gordon telling the Dave Brown trial that "young girls were available to him if and when he chose". In mayor Christian's trial, prosecutor Simon Moore alleged the defendant had a "callous and cavalier" attitude towards the victims. A 51-year-old woman, whose name was withheld, told the court by video link from New Zealand that complaining about rape was pointless. "That's the way it is on Pitcairn. You get abused, you get raped." One woman broke down in tears several times and said she felt unable to tell anybody else on the island what had happened to her. "It seemed to be the normal way of life on Pitcairn -- how the girls were treated as though they were sex things," she said. Pitcairn remained uninhabited until mate Fletcher Christian aboard the Royal Navy ship HMS Bounty led a mutiny on April 28, 1789 against Captain William Bligh, who was set adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Eight mutineers along with six Tahitian men, 12 Tahitian women and a small girl then searched the South Seas for a haven, reaching uninhabited Pitcairn on January 15, 1790. Six other island men charged with sex crimes have yet to be extradited from Australia and New Zealand.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[At least 100 people were killed and 180 wounded as US and Iraqi troops stormed the rebel-held city of Samarra in a first effort to restore government control before promised elections, while a shocked nation buried 34 children killed by car bombs. Meanwhile, Iraq's hostage crisis showed no let-up Friday, with Jakarta confirming two female nationals were among the 10 latest victims. Al-Jazeera television said the two Indonesians were seized along with six Iraqis and two Lebanese working for an electrical equipment firm. An Indonesian diplomat appeared on the news channel, appealing for the women's release. A massive force of 3,000 US troops and 2,000 Iraqi auxiliaries poured into Samarra before dawn and seized the city hall and police stations in the largest joint operation since last year's invasion. The armoured assault came just a day after the US-backed interim government vowed to restore control over all insurgent enclaves in the restive Sunni Arab belt north and west of Baghdad by next month in readiness for nationwide polls promised for January. "In response to repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces (US military terminology for insurgents), Iraqi security forces and multinational forces secured the government and police buildings in Samarra," the US military said. A spokesman said 114 insurgents were killed for the loss of just one US soldier. Four more American troops were wounded. Samarra's main hospital received 90 dead and 180 wounded, said Dr Khaled Ahmed. There was intense fighting between troops and insurgents in the city centre around the gold-domed Imam Ali al-Hadi mausoleum, a revered Shiite Muslim shrine in the midst of this overwhelmingly Sunni Arab city of some 250,000 people. Smoke billowed into the sky as the two sides traded fire on the hallowed ground, but the Iraqi army's 36th Commando Battalion secured the area and there was no damage to the mausoleum, the military said. A Turkish hostage was freed by US troops in the city, it added. By midday Friday (0900 GMT), US forces held the city hall and police stations, while Iraqi troops had won control of key heritage sites, including the renowned spiral minaret of the ninth-century Al-Malwiya mosque on Samarra's outskirts. Iraqi forces captured 37 insurgents, said National Security Advisor Qassem Daoud. The massive offensive came despite mounting talk in recent days of an imminent deal between insurgents and Iraq's interim authorities for a peaceful restoration of government control. Only Thursday, provincial governor Hamed Hamud al-Qaissy said a deal was close and cautioned against any resort to force, saying it risked a new spiral of violence in the region. The leader of a Samarra political association also expressed dismay at the the offensive. "We were in talks with Prs. A double suicide car bombing at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Baghdad Thursday killed 34 children and eight adults, capping one of Iraq's deadliest months that saw nearly 600 people killed, according to an AFP count. Adults and children in the poverty-stricken neighbourhood of Al-Amel, where the streets are filled with rubbish and sewage, were gathered for the opening of a brand-new water pump station built by the US military. The attacks followed another car bombing west of the capital that killed one US soldier and two Iraqis. In a new bid to secure the release of British hostage Kenneth Bigley, 100,000 leaflets from his family appealing for the 62-year-old engineer's release were handed out at Baghdad mosques, some of them in areas loyal to the insurgents, the British embassy said. But an unofficial French mediator acknowledged in Damascus that his bid to secure the release of two captive French newsmen had failed. French lawmaker Didier Julia said US forces had attempted several times to torpedo the rescue mission, leaving six Iraqi security guards dead in one incident. But the US military called Julia's allegations untrue. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin refused to be downcast, saying the information coming out of Iraq about the hostages was "not complete" and that the government still had "a favourable outlook" about the prospects for a happy ending.]]></c>

Suzuki's first-inning leadoff single to left field off Texas right-handed pitcher Ryan Drese gave him the same number of hits as George Sisler, who set the record in 1920 while playing for the St. Louis Browns. With a standing ovation from the crowd and flashbulbs greeting every pitch, Suzuki took a no-ball, two-strike offering and slapped it between the Texas third baseman and shortstop into left field to the delight of a sellout crowd. Suzuki advanced on singles by Randy Winn and Raul Ibanez but was stranded at third base after Bret Boone grounded into an inning-ending double play. Suzuki did have an edge in his quest for the record. Sisler set the mark in a 154-game season while this is Seattle's 160th game of the current season.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[STRASBOURG, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Muslim highschool student who refused to remove her headscarf as required by a new French law when she arrived for classes has shaved her head, an AFP photographer said. The 15-year-old girl, only identified as Cennet, had been barred from attending classes and spent school days at a study room at Strasbourg's Louis-Pasteur gymnasium since the resumption of school after the summer break. On Friday she returned to school with her head neatly shaved. "Cennet has tried everything -- a hat, a cap, a bandana but she kept being turned away when she wanted to enter the classroom," her mother said in a telephone interview. Strasbourg school officials said that on Friday she came to school without a headdress and was allowed to return to her class. In the Strasbourg school district 18 students are still known to refuse to remove their headscarf. French Education Minister Francois Fillon said almost two weeks ago that last year a little over 1,500 girls had worn headscarves in France throughout the school year. There were 635 cases at the start of classes this year, Fillon said in a radio interview. The new law which prohibits the headscarf and other "conspicuous" religious insignia from state schools took effect a month ago despite complaints from some Muslim groups that it was a form of discrimination against Islam. Under the law school authorities must first try to persuade girls to remove the headscarf and only if they persist in refusing can they be expelled.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Treasury Secretary John Snow urged China Friday to act more decisively to implement a flexible exchange rate hours after his department announced that Chinese officials had promised to move "firmly and steadily" toward easing their currency policy. "Sustained, non-inflationary growth in China is important for maintaining strong global growth, and a more flexible and market-based. exchange rate is an important part of achieving this goal," Snow told reporters following talks here between Group of Seven finance chiefs and their Chinese counterparts. "I have been encouraged by some of the advances that have occurred. Tonight I underscored that I would like to see China move more quickly." Snow's appeal came after the US Treasury Department said in a statement that at a meeting Thursday of US and Chinese officials Beijing reaffirmed its "commitment to further advance reform and to push ahead firmly and steadily to a market-based flexible exchange rate." On Friday Finance Minister Jin Renqing and the head of the Chinese central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, joined counterparts at a dinner following a meeting of the Group of Seven countries, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. It was the first appearance at a G7 gathering of senior Chinese officials and was seen as belated recognition by the major industrialized powers of China's stature in the world economy. The United States and its G7 partners have made no secret of their displeasure with the Chinese currency's dollar peg, which they say artificially weakens the cost of Chinese exports -- making them more competitive -- while increasing the cost of imported goods in China. A newly formed US labor, industry and farm alliance, the China Currency Coalition, maintains that Chinese imports in the United States are undervalued by 40 percent and US exports to China overvalued by the same figure. German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said G7 ministers nonetheless stressed that when China does decide to modify its exchange rate regime it should not be done hastily and should be accompanied by "internal reforms" to avoid economic disruption in China and elsewhere. US Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Sander Levin meanwhile dismissed the reported Chinese offer announced Friday by the US Treasury as nothing new and said Washington had failed to extract "concrete action" from Beijing. "Contrary to comments by administration and Chinese officials, it is not accurate to say that China's promise to move 'firmly and steadily to a market-based flexible exchange rate' is a 'new policy,'" they argued in a letter to Snow. "In fact, it is merely a re-statement of the same rhetoric that China has issued for at least five years." Outside US government circles, analysts likewise suggested that China's statement of intent would not lead to any near-term nd trigger higher, growth-dampening interest rate hikes in the United States and elsewhere.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[President Megawati Sukarnoputri would make a televised appeal Saturday for the release of two Indonesian women held hostage in Iraq, her spokesman told AFP. "She will make an appeal through Al-Jazeera," said Garibaldi Sujatmiko, head of the presidential press bureau. He said the content of her message was still being discussed and the Al-Jazeera crew was to arrive shortly to record the message at Megawati's home. Indonesia's ambassador to Qatar, Abdel Wahed Maktoub, went on Al-Jazeera Friday, appealing to an Islamic militant group in Iraq to release the women.

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Group of Seven finance chiefs called on oil producers for help Friday in keeping energy prices manageable as they pledged action to alleviate the debt burden on poor countries and renewed an appeal for exchange rate flexibility. Finance ministers and central bankers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States also gave an upbeat assessment for global economic prospects next year, describing them as "favorable." But they warned in a statement following a meeting here that growth was uneven and at risk from high oil prices. "We call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices moderate," they said, adding that consumers had to boost energy efficiency. "We're urging the countries with reserves to do everything they can to make sure that the supplies are adequate to meet market requirements," US Treasury Secretary John Snow told reporters following the meeting. "That commitment on their side to make adequate reserves available will help deal with some market uncertainty, which I think is feeding some speculation and which is taking the spot price well above the fundamentals in the markets." Snow added that high energy prices "reduce the level of disposable income that people have to use for other claims," noting that US consumer sentiment had weakened in the second quarter. "I don't think we're going to have a recession but what I'm worrying about is a slowing of this good growth in the world economy." A more ominous assessment came from European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet, who said that "all we are observing today is not encouraging." He said that if oil prices continued to climb it would pose "a serious problem" for the world economy. The G7 also took note of increased agitation for action by rich countries to ease the debt burden carried by the world's most impoverished nations, many of which spend more on debt servicing than on social welfare. "We are now committed to addressing the sustainability of debt of the poorest countries by making progress on debt relief and grant financing," the statement said. Ministers stopped short of endorsing a proposal by Britain to write off its share of debt and avoided any mention of proposals advocated by development activists for a 100-percent cancellation of obligations carried by poor nations. Two groups pressing for a full write-off of debt for the poorest countries criticized the G7 for a lack of action. "The G7 have chosen to delay debt cancellation that could have put 100 million children incompetitive -- while increasing the cost of foreign goods in the Chinese market.

		<t><![CDATA[Afghan police chief says warlords intimidate northern voters by Rachel Morarjee.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MAZAR-I SHARIF, Afghanistan, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[With a week to go until Afghanistan's historic election, it is not only voters who are intimidated by the gunmen of warlord Abdul Rashid Dostam -- even the local police chief is scared. "People have been told which candidate to vote for. This is a reality," General Mohammed Akram Khakraiswall, the ethnic Pashtun police chief for the northern province of Balkh said. When asked which candidates and local warlords had been intimidating voters in the run-up to October 9 polls the thick-set, bearded General laughed and dodged the question. "The police are also afraid of telling everything because we are not powerful enough," he said. General Akram, as he is known in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif has his work cut out providing security for the elections with a staff of poorly-trained and ill-equipped police, many of them drawn from local militias. His turf is the stamping ground of two powerful local warlords -- one of whom is standing for president in the upcoming election. The governor of Balkh province is General Mohammed Atta while in neighbouring Shiberghan city in Jawzjan province General Dostam, who is standing against President Hamid Karzai in upcoming polls, holds sway. The two generals -- Atta an ethnic Tajik and Dostam an Uzbek -- loathe each other and have come to blows several times over the last year. In a country divided by ethnicity, they still command powerful militias -- Afghanistan's former 7th and 8th militia corps -- despite the stuttering beginnings of UN-backed disarmament program. "Since there are armed men all over the countryside, some of the candidates who lose the election could threaten security with riots," General Akram said. In Balkh province, each polling site will be guarded by four policemen, two women from the education ministry and a representative from the National Directorate of Security with radio links to local NATO-led peacekeepers and Afghan army troops. "For example, they could come to enter the polling site with armed men or take the ballot box. We are expecting such incidents so we are getting ready," the police chief said. He speculated that the seven staff guarding the polling site should be able to hold out for an hour or two until reinforcements arrived. General Akram himself is an advertisement of how powerless Afghanistan's fledgling police force is in the face of intimidation and violence by local militia. In July this year he was held hostage in his house for almost three weeks, and British forces from the local Provisional Reconstruction Team kept him fed and watered while he negotiated his release with General Mohammed Atta. Atta has since been appointed governor of Balkh province and has paid lipservice to both the disarmament process and the principle of a free election. Rights groups though, say both Atta and Dostam are using their militias to bully voters and order tribal elders to get their communities to vote for certain candidates. A report this week by Human Rights Watch said police, military and intelligence forces in Mazar-i-Sharif and the surrounding northern provinces are controlled by factions allied with Dostam, Atta or ethnic Hazara general Mohammed Mohaqeq. Commanders allied with the three warlords have "already threatened local leaders to vote as they command," it added. Largely illiterate populations, who have no idea what a secret ballot is or any guarantee that it will be secret, are widely expected to vote as they are told. General Akram said, however, he thought that villagers would pledge their support in public for a certain candidate and then vote as they wanted to. "People want a free and fair election and if they feel this is a secure environment, they will vote as they want to," he said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki set the Major League Baseball record for hits in a single season here Friday, the Japanese star reaching 258 hits in 2004 to break the mark set by George Sisler in 1920. Suzuki singled in the first inning off Texas pitcher Ryan Drese to match the mark and tagged the Rangers right-hander again for a single in the third inning to break the record set 84 years ago by the former St. Louis Browns star. Facing a full count of three balls and two strikes, Suzuki smacked the ball up the middle for the record. As fireworks exploded and a screaming crowd gave him a standing ovation, Suzuki smiled before being surrounded by joyful teammates. The last-place Mariners have struggled through a dismal season with Suzuki's pursuit of the record the only drama surrounding the club. Suzuki walked to the stands and shook hands with Sisler's daughter, part of a sellout crowd, then walked back to first base and tipped his batting helmet to the cheering crowd, which chanted "I-chi-ro, I-chi-ro". Even Texas infielders tipped their caps to acknowledge his achievement as the crowd refused to quiet down and let play resume until Suzuki tipped his helmet one final time. Suzuki did have an edge in his quest for the record. Sisler set the mark in a 154-game season while this is Seattle's 160th game of the season. Suzuki, who entered the game 8-for-18 lifetime against Drese, missed twice in chances to match Sisler one night earlier in Oakland but equaled the mark with a leadoff single to left field in the first inning. With a standing ovation from the crowd and flashbulbs greeting every pitch, Suzuki took a no-ball, two-strike offering and slapped it between the Texas third baseman and shortstop into left field to equal the mark. Suzuki, known simply by his first name in his homeland, advanced on singles by Randy Winn and Raul Ibanez in the first but was stranded at third base after Bret Boone grounded into an inning-ending double play.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[At least two men have killed themselves after being questioned as part of a massive crackdown on child pornography in Australia, police said Saturday, as media reports put the number of suicides at four. The deaths followed an Australia-wide series of raids which led to the arrest of more than 200 people accused of downloading child pornography from the Internet. Suspects included police officers, teachers and doctors. Police in Victoria state said the bodies of two men being investigated were found Friday and the deaths were not being treated as suspicious. "Victoria Police can confirm that two men have died after being the subject of separate police inquiries," a police spokeswoman said. She said one of the dead men was questioned by officers from the police taskforce investigating child porn, codenamed Operation Auxin. The Sydney Morning Herald said the second man, a prison officer, had been questioned as part of a separate child pornography investigation. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said a Queensland state police officer killed himself last month after being questioned in the early stages of Operation Auxin's investigations. It said the body of another man, named in the Herald as electrician Kim Della-Vedova, was found on Friday after he failed to appear on court. Police have said 500 people could face charges as a result of the investigation and Prime Minister John Howard has offered to introduce tougher legislation if needed to stamp out child pornography. The Australian investigation followed a tip-off from US authorities about a child porn network operating about 20 pay-to-view websites originating in eastern Europe and run by crime groups.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Kobe Bryant's accuser planned to keep quiet about encounter: documents.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[EAGLE, Colorado, Oct 1 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The woman who has accused Kobe Bryant of raping her was going to keep quiet about her notorious encounter with the NBA basketball prodigy until her ex-boyfriend and a co-worker urged her to speak to police, according to police documents released Friday. A transcript of investigators' interviews with her ex-boyfriend Matt Herr, whom she called one hour after her encounter with the Los Angeles Lakers star, shows she intended to keep it a secret -- as she claims Bryant ordered her to do. The transcript is part of 354 pages from the Eagle County Sheriff's Department's file on the case. Herr said that after she left the upscale Lodge and Spa at Cordillera, where she worked, his ex-girlfriend telephoned and told him "that she just wanted to forget about it and that nobody would believe her." The woman finally sat down with investigators after Herr and a co-worker of hers at Cordillera urged her to do so. A Colorado judge dismissed rape charges against Bryant last month after his accuser refused to testify in the case, but the basketball player still faces a civil suit for damages. In a 31-page transcript of her interview with investigators, the woman said she pleaded with Bryant to stop sexually attacking her. "I wouldn't say he was choking me," said the woman, now 20. "I could breathe, but he had his hands tight enough around my neck, so that I thought he would choke me." She added that Bryant "continually had one hand around my neck and with his other hand, pushed me over to the side of the two chairs, um, turned me around and bent me over and lifted up my skirt." She said she told Bryant "no" when he lifted up her skirt and again when he removed her underwear, the documents show. She knew he heard her, she claimed, "Because every time I said no he tightened his hold around me." Bryant, meanwhile, told police he had consensual sex with the woman, who "initiated the sexual contact," and would probably have to pay her hush money. "She has to have a motive to do this," Bryant told detectives when they first approached him at the Cordillera, just after midnight, July 1, 2003, little more than 24 hours after he was with his accuser. "Are you willing to pay that, if she is," he was asked by Detective Dan Loya. "I got to. I got to. I'm in the worst (expletive) situation," said Bryant, who also told investigators, "This is my career."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[COTABATO, Philippines, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A powerful home-made bomb exploded in a compound housing offices of an autonomous Muslim regional government in the southern Philippine city of Cotabato, wounding one person, police said Saturday. The blast late Friday came two days before Latin American ambassadors were scheduled to visit the city to scout for investment opportunities, officials said. City police chief Ajijul Taradji said the bomb was apparently planted in a jeep that entered the compound of the government of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The explosion destroyed the jeep and wounded a local trader who sustained shrapnel wounds but was believed to be in a stable condition, Ajijul said. The explosion was the second to rock Cotabato city this week. On Wednesday unidentified men tossed a hand grenade into a residential district, killing an eight-year-old child and wounding three others. Police said no motive for either attack had been established and no group had claimed responsibility. Heavily armed policemen have been deployed around the ARMM compound. The ARMM consists of four mostly Muslim provinces and a city in the southern island of Mindanao, the scene of a decades-old Muslim separatist rebellion. Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels operate in the area, as do other armed groups of former guerrillas who have turned to banditry.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A man in northern Vietnam has been sentenced to death by firing squad and three others received life terms in jail as courts enforced a zero tolerance approach to illegal narcotics, state-media said Saturday. Nguyen Van Hung, 40, the ringleader of a group of 12, was sentenced to death after being convicted of trafficking 1,420 grams (about 50 ounces) of heroin. His wife received a life term, the Vietnam News Agency said. Their two accomplices were given life terms in the same trial on Thursday. The Hanoi people's court also handed down jail terms ranging from 30 months to 20 years to eight other defendants. Police detected the ring in July 2002 after it had trafficked large quantities of drugs from Ha Tay province in the north to the capital. At least 93 people have been sentenced to death this year in Vietnam and 53 have been executed by firing squad, according to figures compiled from state media and court officials.]]></c>

The Zhongshan Bridge, built in 1909 by the Qing Dynasty government (1644-1911), is at Lanzhou, the capital of northwest China's Gansu Province. The American-designed bridge, measuring 233.5 meters (770 feet) in length and more than eight meters in width, has undergone three major reparations since it was first built, the Xinhua news agency said. The latest reconstruction started four months ago with the municipal government listing the bridge as a cultural relic in need of protection and transforming it into a pedestrian pass only. It was renovated by a German firm which guaranteed that the bridge would be serviceable for another 80 years, Xinhua said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A repeat sex offender who pretended to be a "temple medium" to molest a woman has received the maximum sentence of two years' jail, media reports said Saturday. Loo Chee Seng, 51, convinced a 27-year-old woman in 2000 that he was an incarnation of a god and molested her after saying it was part of a ritual to cleanse her of bad luck and make the moles on her body disappear, the Straits Times said. District judge Kow Keng Siong said in court when he sentenced Loo on Friday it was "clear" that the maximum sentence was necessary. Loo was released from jail in 1998 after serving a four-year sentence for a similar con job, in which he convinced a woman into performing oral sex on him and then raped her. Defence lawyer David Ng said in his mitigation plea that "there was no physical violence involved". But deputy public prosecutor Adam Nakhoda replied that a deterrent sentence was needed as Loo was "unrepentant" and had caused the victim "mental anguish", the paper said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Luxury watch and jewellery events are being staged in Singapore this month as the city-state eyes wealthy tourists from China and India, media reports said Saturday. JewelFest 2004 is a month-long sale drawing jewellers across the city-state, the Straits Times reported. A survey conducted by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in 2002 found that 2.9 billion Singapore dollars (1.7 billion US), or 53 percent, of all tourism expenditure in the city went to shopping, with 10 percent of that amount derived from jewellery. Chinese tourists proved to be the biggest spenders on jewellery, while the Indians came in third place. Taiwanese shoppers were in second place. Chairman of JewelFest 2004 and general manager of local jewellery chain TianPo, Rosalind Foong-Lim said the event was being targeted at the Chinese because they were cash rich and "more experimental", the paper said. The inaugural Singapore International Watch Auction, to be held on October 23, is being touted as the island nation's equivalent of a similar event held by renowned English auction house Christie's, the paper said. The auction will feature 240 collectible watches worth three million Singapore dollars (1.8 million US). But owner of watch retailer Bezel: The Watch Collector's Guild, Ong Chih Ching, told the Straits Times that the pieces up for auction were each affordable. "For a few hundred dollars or so, you can own an antique watch," the paper quoted her as saying. The two events are hoped to capture "highly mobile individuals" from China and India, STB's director of tourism shopping Sulian Tan-Wijaya told the paper. "The Malaysians and Indonesians are regulars. Now, we hope to see that happen with the Chinese and Indians too," the paper quoted her as saying. STB has organised 34,000 travel packages across Asia in conjunction with the events.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indonesia on Sunday was awaiting news of two women held hostage in Iraq by kidnappers demanding the release of a jailed militant cleric after a pleas from the president of the world's largest Muslim nation. A day after President Megawati Sukarnoputri appealed on Arab television for the women's release, officials in Jakarta said they were seeking ways to contact the abductors while trying to confirm the identities of the captives. A group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq said it seized the women and demanded that Jakarta release Abu Bakar Bashir, an Indonesian cleric police say leads the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group. Although the abductors, in a written statement sent to the Al-Jazeera television network, named the two hostages as Rosidah binti Anom and Rafikah binti Aming, Indonesian authorities have yet to find their relatives. "Until now, we do not yet have the precise identity of the two. Nobody has come up so far to say they know any of the two women," Ferry Adamhar, the foreign ministry's director for citizens' protection, told AFP. Adamhar, who is leading a team to help secure the women's release, said officials were combing districts on Java island where the hostages are believed from in the hope of finding relatives to make further appeals. The two women, reportedly seized alongside six Iraqis and two Lebanese all working for electronics company G-Bell, were pictured in Islamic headscarves in footage shot by their captors and aired on Al-Jazeera on Friday. On Saturday the Arab news channel broadcast an appeal by Megawati for their release in which the Indonesian president, whose country staunchly opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq, said there was no political reason for the kidnapping. "I sincerely ask in my own name, in the name of the state, in the name of the Indonesian government, that they be immediately freed from the hands of the hostage-takers so they can go home again to their families," she said. Lawyers for Bashir, who is in jail awaiting trial for terrorism, told AFP that the cleric also rejected the abductor's demands, saying he refused to be released in return for the women's freedom. "My release should be made through the legal channel, even though the Indonesian justice is until today, still dominated by, and working for, foreign interests," lawyer Mahendradatta quoted Bashir as having said. He said Bashir remained adamant that the two women be freed unconditionally. Police say Bashir leads the Jemaah Islamiyah extremist group blamed for a series of attacks including the October 2002 Bali bombings, and the Jakarta Marriott hotel blast in 2003 and the Australian embassy bombing here last month. Bashir, who is awaiting trial for his alleged role in various bomb attacks, has been quoted as saying the embassy bombing was part of a US and Australian conspiracy to divide Muslims. A court cleared Bashir last year of heading Jemaah Islamiyah but he was re-arrested in April immediately after completing a sentence for other offences. Police say they have new evidence that he leads the group.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei arrived Sunday in South Korea, where his agency is investigating unauthorized nuclear research. ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is in South Korea to attend a conference but IAEA officials said discussions on Seoul's nuclear activities would follow. He will meet Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hae-Chan on Monday and Unification Minister Chung Dong-Young on Tuesday, Seoul officials said. IAEA inspectors last month visited the country to investigate Seoul's shock revelations of past secret experiments with potential ingredients for nuclear bombs. South Korea disclosed in September that its scientists secretly enriched a tiny amount of plutonium in 1982 and uranium in 2000. It said the laboratory experiments were not linked to nuclear weapons programs but ElBaradei has expressed "serious concern". The clandestine activity has embarrassed the United States and South Korea at a time when they are trying, through six-party talks, to pressure Stalinist North Korea to end its nuclear weapons drive. The North has refused to take part in a fourth round of the multilateral talks, blaming "hostile" US policy and the secret nuclear experiments. ElBaradei, who is being tipped as a possible Nobel Peace Prize winner, travels Wednesday to Japan. The prizewinner is to be announced on Friday in Oslo. Observers have said they expect the Nobel committee this year to hail efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Philippine Roman Catholic leader has warned against granting amnesty to military officers who launched a mutiny last year, saying there must be a guarantee against further adventurism. Archbishop Gaudencio Rosales, who is in charge of the church in Manila, said the eight military coup attempts and mutinies mounted since 1986 had scared away foreign investment and seriously harmed the economy. "It's up to the government if they want to grant (the mutineers) amnesty but they should ensure that these things will not happen again because this is an obstacle to our development," the church leader said in remarks released Sunday. He was reacting to signs that the junior military officers who mounted a short-lived mutiny against President Gloria Arroyo in July last year, might be pardoned after they publicly apologized last month. Defense secretary Avelino Cruz said the coup attempt leaders could be granted pardons and that the soldiers who took part "would be reinstated in accordance with the rules", but would be demoted or reprimanded. Critics have said the failure to sternly punish the military men behind seven earlier coup attempts from 1986 to 1989, had encouraged the junior officers to mount a mutiny last year. "If this was stopped after the first (coup attempt) our nation would now be more progressive," Rosales said. The government has said Arroyo offered not amnesty but a lenient treatment to the junior officers. The officers led 300 soldiers in taking over a portion of the Makati financial district, demanding that Arroyo and other officials step down because of alleged corruption and abuse of power. The bloodless mutiny fizzled out less than 24 hours later when the soldiers failed to rally support from the armed forces.]]></c>

The suspects told police they had had an argument with a security guard at the cafe and wanted to take revenge on him, the newspaper reported. Frustrated that they could not find the guard, the young men "lost their senses" and started stabbing the customers indiscriminately, the report said. Earlier reports said most of the injured were stabbed in the back and arm. One man was said to be in serious condition but officials at the Tongzhou Luhe hospital refused to comment on his condition on Sunday.

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Police have reinforced security around several facilities including the American embassy after receiving a fresh Al-Qaeda threat against South Korea and other US allies which have troops in Iraq, officials said Sunday. Some 5,000 policemen are on a heightened alert to counter any attacks, said the National Police Agency's anti-terror task force. A squad of special commandos was posted near the high-walled and barricaded US embassy in Seoul, and police with sniffer dogs stepped up their patrols at airports, the force said. "With the troops reinforced to 5,000, we have been on a heightened anti-terrorism alert since Saturday," a senior official at the task force said requesting anonymity. Seoul's foreign ministry told its missions overseas Saturday to step up security for South Korean interests from possible attacks following an National Security Council meeting on the Al-Qaeda threat. The security alert came after Al-Jazeera television Friday broadcast a message attributed to Al-Qaeda number two Ayman al-Zawahiri urging Muslims to attack member-countries of the US-led coalition in Iraq. The message said: "We should start the resistance from now. The interests of the Americans, English, Australian, French, Polish, Norwegian, South Korean and Japanese are everywhere." South Korea recently sent 2,800 troops to Arbil, a Kurdish-controlled town in the north of Iraq. With another 800 troops to be sent in November, the South Korean contingent makes up the third largest foreign force in the US-led coalition in Iraq. Islamic militants beheaded a South Korean hostage, Kim Sun-Il, in June after President Roh Moo-Hyun's rejection of their demand that Seoul scrap its plan to send troops to Iraq. In August, a group calling itself Ashap Rayat Sud (Black Banners), linked to the Islamic militant organization Ansar al-Sunna, sent a videotape to Seoul, threatening to attack South Korean troops and citizens in retaliation. Ansar al-Sunna has claimed responsibility for many attacks, including a suicide bombing which killed at least 105 in Arbil in February.]]></c>

Klitschko, who suffered a deep cut over his right eye, won by a split decision after the ring doctor halted the scheduled 10-round fight at the end of the fifth round. The clash of heads took place late in the fifth and opened a deep gash that the ring doctor said went down to the bone. "I built my fight with my left jab," said Klitschko. "I was using both hands well and I wanted to continue the fight." Two judges scored the fight for Klitschko (49-46, 49-46) and one judge had Williamson ahead (48-47) at the time the featured heavyweight bout was stopped on a card that also boasted two title bouts at the new outdoor Amphitheatre at Caesars Palace. Williamson was frustrated with the ending. He said his his plan was to take tire Klitschko by forcing him to go into the later rounds. He knocked Klitschko down in the fourth round with a straight right hand to the head. "This is unfinished business," Williamson said. "We should do it again." Klitschko tried to downplay the knockdown saying, "I was off balance and he caught me with a right hand." The odd ending and knockdown did little to boost Klitschko's sagging credibility. It wasn't long ago that the younger Wladimir was being hailed as the stronger of the two fighting Klitschko brothers. Now older brother Vitali holds the World Boxing Council title while Wladimir's stock has fallen. On April 10, Wladimir was floored in the fifth round by Lamon Brewster in a fight for the vacant World Boxing Organization title. Vitali will make the first defence of his WBC title against Britain's Danny Williams in December.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenians were voting in general elections Sunday that may force the centre-left coalition that has ruled the former Yugoslav state for over a decade to form an alliance with the right-wing opposition. With voting expected to be very close, the main party in government, the Liberal Democracy (LDS) party, is ready to consider forming a coalition with current opposition rivals to remain in power, Prime Minister and LDS leader Anton Rop made clear as he wrapped up campaigning Friday. "We expect to win a relative victory on Sunday that will enable us to build a stable coalition government," Rop said. "Let us surprise you," Rop said, when asked about chances of a coalition with his party's main rival, the opposition centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), expected to do well Sunday. Over 20 parties, eight of them represented in parliament, will be fighting for 90 seats in the legislature, in the first national election in the tiny Alpine state of only 1.6 million registered voters since it joined the European Union last May. Polls opened Sunday at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) and close at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT). Exit poll projections are expected immediately after the closure of polls. The country's electoral commission is expected to publish first partial results after 10:00 pm (2000 GMT). Opinion polls forecast a turnout of over 70 percent compared to 28 percent registered in European parliament elections in June and predict a tight race. Voter turnout is expected to be crucial -- the opposition fared well in European parliamentary elections in June when participation was low. "It would be very hard to forecast a winner. All scenarios are possible," Miha Kovac, columnist for the newspaper Dnevnik, told AFP. A poll by the influential newspaper Delo predicted the opposition SDS would win the most votes, with 21.5 percent, followed by the LDS with 21.3 percent. This was with a projected turnout of around 74 percent. The future parliament is expected to have two, almost equal blocs, which will make decision-making more complicated than in the outgoing legislature, where the LDS and its allies control 58 seats out of 90. Public opinion in Slovenia has been moving to the right over the past year-and-a-half, with people weary of almost 12 years of LDS rule, Kovac said. SDS leader Janez Jansa's campaign was centered this year on blaming the LDS for failing to deliver on promises it made in 2000, especially those concerning economic growth, highway construction and increase of pensions. "Over the last four years the LDS has made five fouls (as in basketball) and it is time for voters to replace it as in every fair-play game," Jansa said at a rally in Ljubljana on Wednesday, wrapping up his campaign. But Rop has defended his record, saying that the cabinet he took over from Drnovsek in 2002 led the country into the EU and NATO, started the process for entering the eurozone by 2007, reduced unemployment and is on its way to making Slovenia one of the EU's most developed countries. The Slovenian Journalists' Union (SNS) is to launch a limited strike Sunday to call for a new collective agreement for journalists. But the strike will not prevent journalists from publishing reports on the elections.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[An editor of a newspaper in Bangladesh's northwestern city of Bogra was killed early Sunday by five axe-wielding youths who appeared to be professional killers, police said. Dipankar Chakroborty, 59, editor of the Bengali daily Durjoy Bangla, was heading home at around 12:20 am Sunday when the gang struck him down with traditional axes, killing him instantly, police said. "Some five criminals did this murder and from the type of attack it seems they were professional killers," said Nurul Islam, officer in charge in Bogra. "He died instantly. So far we have no clue who was behind the attack," Islam told AFP. Police are investigating the motive for the attack, he said. Witnesses said they saw five youths on two motorcycles at the time of the attack. International media watchdogs have ranked Bangladesh as one of the most violent countries for journalists, although the government disagrees. Since 1997, at least seven Bangladeshi journalists have been killed in reprisal for their work, the Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has reported. It described Bangladesh as "by far the world's most violent country for journalists", saying at least 26 reporters had been attacked or threatened in January alone. Analysts have blamed Bangladesh's confrontational style of politics for putting the country's journalists at risk.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Serbian voters went to the polls for the second round of local elections on Sunday to choose between moderate and ultra-nationlist candidates for mayors in cities and towns throughout the country. These are the first democratic local elections in Serbia since nationalist president strongman Slobodan Milosevic and his regime were ousted in October 2000. Polling stations opened in 148 municipalities at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) and were due to close at 8:00 pm (1800 GMT). Serbian reformist President Boris Tadic and moderate nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica have joined forces since the first round of the local elections on September 19, in a bid to strengthen the democratic bloc and defeat the hardline nationalist Serbian Radical Party. Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) won around 30 percent of the vote in the first round of the ballot two weeks ago, while the Radicals obtained 27 percent. Their candidates face each other in a run-off for the post of mayor in Belgrade and most other Serbian towns. Turnout was low in the first round, when only 34 percent of the six million eligible voters cast ballots. This is first time mayors are being elected directly, following the introduction of new electoral laws. In the capital Belgrade, Democratic Party candidate Nenad Bogdanovic is favoured to defeat ultra-nationalist Aleksandar Vucic. The position of Belgrade mayor is considered the third most important post in the country, after that of prime minister and president. Belgrade's mayor controls a capital city with a population of 1.7 million. After the first round, Tadic and Kostunica reached an agreement to form coalitions in local parliaments and fight together against the Radicals in the second round. The Radicals became the strongest single party in the Serbian parliament after the general election in December 2003 but were unable to form a government. This is the first such deal between the moderate parties since Tadic was elected president in June but the fraught relations between the two camps may make its application difficult. The Democratic Party will be hoping for a strong showing in Novi Sad, the capital of Vojvodina province and the second largest town in Serbia, where the Radicals' candidate has had an advantage since the first round. Ethnically-mixed Vojvodina, in the north of Serbia, was recently the scene of violence between the ethnic Serb and ethnic Hungarian communities. Along with local elections for mayors, voters in Vojvodina were casting their ballots in the run-off for the provincial parliament.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Three-time former division champion Felix Trinidad shook off the rust from 29 months of retirement by beating Ricardo Mayorga in the eighth round of a middleweight bout on Saturday. Puerto Rico's Trinidad knocked Mayorga down three times in the eighth, before stopping the former champion with 21 seconds remaining at Madison Square Gardens. "Mayorga is a boxer who hits hard and can take a punch," Trinidad said. "But I said that it would win." The 31-year-old Trinidad, who won titles in three weight classes before suddenly retiring in July 2002, was impressive throughout the fight. He got the better of a series of explosive exchanges in the first round and dominated Mayorga in the eighth round. Trinidad improved to 42-1 following his 35th knockout while Mayorga, of Nicaragua, dropped to 27-5-1. Trinidad hurt Mayorga with a body shot halfway through the eighth round but Mayorga managed to beat the count. Seconds later, Mayorga was down again but he wanted to continue. In the first round, Mayorga was the more aggressive of the two. Midway through, the brash Mayorga dropped his hands and dared Trinidad to hit him. Mayorga was credited with a knockdown in the third when he smacked Trinidad on top of the head and his glove brushed the canvas. In the fifth round, the more experienced Trinidad swarmed Mayorga, unleashing a furious display of punches. He opened a gash under the left eye Mayorga and the one-sided action continued in the next round. There was a break in the sixth after Trinidad hit Mayorga in the hip with 40 seconds left in the round. Mayorga used the incident to gather his senses and catch his breath. Mayorga came out strong in the seventh but was caught by a left hook to the body and then more combinations to the head. With the win, Trinidad hopes to entice undisputed champ Bernard Hopkins into a rematch. Trinidad's only loss was to Hopkins in 12th-rounds in September 2001 in New York.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[With their trademark smiles and unbridled optimism on overload, the latest batch of American Idol celebrities held an energetic press conference in Singapore on Sunday ahead of their only Asian concert. Seven of this year's 10 finalists, including winner Fantasia Barrino, runner-up Diana DeGarmo and Hawaiian teenager Jasmine Trias, will perform at Singapore's 8,000-capacity Indoor Stadium on Tuesday night. The concert is the final public performance for the American Idols after three months of touring and 50 shows in the United States. But the seven appeared anything but jaded as they clapped and cheered each others' comments throughout the 45-minute press conference and spoke of their hopes for the future. "I'm not going to let you forget me. I'm going to be on cereal packets, milk cartons, ice-cream trucks," Barrino said, adding her debut album was not far away either. The others shared similar ambitions on singing, product endorsements, acting and anything else that would maintain their celebrity lifestyles now their manufactured time in the spotlight is almost over. "Me, Jennifer (Hudson) and La Toya (London), we are going to be the next Destiny's Child," Fantasia said to more cheers and fist pumps from her colleagues on stage. Trias, who is a huge celebrity in the Philippines thanks to her Filipino ancestry, will travel to Manila on Wednesday to cement her profile in that country and fulfill sponsorship requirements with a US fast-food chain and major local companies. "It's pretty amazing how I can be so big in another country and I have never been there before. It's beyond my imagination," she said. Aside from Trias, Barrino, Hudson and London, the others to perform in Singapore are George Huff and Jon Peter Lewis. The American Idol reality television program is a phenomenally popular amateur singing contest whose winners are chosen by mobile phone subscribers sending votes by text messages after hearing the views of celebrity judges.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Taiwan to test-fire cruise missile which could hit Shanghai: report.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TAIPEI, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Taiwan is to test-fire a cruise missile which could hit the eastern Chinese city of Shanghai, it was reported Sunday, after Taiwanese Premier Yu Shyi-kun threatened to retaliate should China attack the island. The military-controlled Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology plans to test-fire before the year end the weaponry refitted from the indigenous "Hsiung Feng" anti-ship missile, Taipei's Apple Daily said. Mass production could begin in 2006, it said. With a range of 900 missiles (540 miles), the missile could hit the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. If budget permits, Taiwan's military plans to produce six such cruise missiles each year at a cost of 100 million Taiwan dollars (2.94 million US) apiece, the daily said. The defense ministry declined to comment on the report. The institute twice unsuccessfully test-fired the system last year, the daily said. "Chungshan's research team found the problem was with the turbofane engine" which powered the missile, it said, adding the researchers had tackled the problem. The institute kicked off the weaponry development programme in 2000, the daily said. The report came a week after Premier Yu vowed to retaliate should China launch missile attacks against the island. "You (China) have the capability to destroy me and Taiwan should have the capability to counter. You strike me with 100 missiles and I should at least strike back with 50," Yu told a gathering of government officials. "You strike Taipei and Kaohsiung and I shall strike Shanghai. This way Taiwan will be safe," he said. Yu's remarks angered Beijing, which called it a "belligerent provocation" and a "clamor for war." Taiwan's Defense Minister Lee Jye Thursday told parliament China was likely to have 800 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan before the end of 2006 and pressed the case for an 18 billion US dollar special defence budget. Since pro-independence president Chen Shui-bian was re-elected in March, Beijing has stressed its long-standing vow to take Taiwan by force should it declare formal independence.

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japan from next year will conduct immigration screening for South Koreans and Taiwanese in their home countries if they are flying to Japanese regional airports, a report said Sunday. The pre-clearance system aims to prevent illegal entries through regional airports which often have less strict screening, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, citing government sources. The system is likely to start with flights from Taiwan and South Korea since many travellers from those countries fly to regional airports, it said. Because local governments have been stepping up efforts to lure tourists from those countries, the number of charter flights directly to regional airports and the number of illegal entries with fake passports is rising, it noted. The paper said the government hopes in future to include other countries such as China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in the system. According to a draft transport ministry plan, three immigration officers each will be sent to South Korea and Taiwan, the Yomiuri said. They would set up special screening booths inside airports. Japan's two biggest airports, Narita and Kansai, would be excluded from the system to be launched in the year starting April 2005.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Wladimir Klitschko survived a fourth round knockdown to beat DaVarryl Williamson on points after the heavyweight fight was stopped prematurely by an accidental head butt. Klitschko, who suffered a nasty cut over his right eye, won by a split decision after the ring doctor halted the scheduled 10-round fight at the end of the fifth round. The clash of heads took place late in the fifth and opened a deep gash that the ring doctor said went down to the bone. "I built my fight with my left jab," said Klitschko. "I was using both hands well and I wanted to continue the fight." Two judges scored the fight for Klitschko, 49-46, 49-46, and one judge had Williamson ahead 48-47 at the time the featured heavyweight bout was stopped on a card that also boasted two title bouts at the new outdoor Amphitheatre at Caesars Palace.

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Thailand has vowed to provide locally made cheap "copycat" anti-AIDS drugs to 300,000 HIV-positive people here and overseas within the next two years, media reported Sunday. The kingdom is one of the world's key production centres for inexpensive generic anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs along with Brazil and India, and has already geared up production to supply 50,000 low-income Thais living with the virus. ARVs allow many people with HIV/AIDS greatly to extend life expectancy and maintain their health. Government officials told the Bangkok Post that construction of a new state drug factory would ensure ARV production would reach the target. "We have enough capacity to give more people access to low-cost anti-AIDS drugs within two years," Government Pharmaceutical Organisation official Isaraet Gosriwatana told the daily. She said Cambodia and Myanmar would top the list of overseas countries to receive the drugs. Thailand supplied 2.5 million dollars worth of generic ARVs to Myanmar last month. Thailand has repeatedly come under fire from US drug giants over its anti-retroviral program. The companies argue that generic ARVs break patents and deprive the firms of money needed to research new anti-AIDS drugs. Thailand was one of six nations facing serious HIV/AIDS epidemics which forged a pact promoting low-cost drugs at a world AIDS forum it hosted in July. Brazil, China, Nigeria Russia, Thailand and Ukraine forged the alliance, with the aim of treating up to 10 million new patients.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISTALIF, Afghanistan, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[With just days to go before Afghanistan's landmark presidential election, members of the Tajik community on the fertile Shamali Plain seem caught between confusion and concern while some Pashtuns say they will vote for anyone their tribal elders choose. Istalif, less than three hours by road from Kabul, is the centre of the Shamali Plains, a vast and lush Tajik-majority area north of Kabul that has been left largely in ruins by decades of war. At the Mohammad household, mention of the vote brings confusion. "Yes, I'll go and vote," says Ghulan, a 30-year-old carpenter, before admitting he does not know when the poll is, who is running and worst of all that he has not registered yet. "What, do you really need your card to vote." he asks, surprised. His father, Mohammad Afzal, 70, rolls his eyes: "You had to register. I got my card. Someone stole it but I'll get another one before the vote. "Because Karzai's in power, we should vote for him," he says of the favourite, US-backed interim president Hamid Karzai, with an air of authority. Their neighbour smiles, explaining to Afzal that it is already too late for him to get a new voting card. "And in any case, to vote, you should follow the advice of your malik (village elder)." "He will collect all the votes and put them in the ballot", says Abdul Basir, 44. He appeared not to know that voters would have go to the polling booths individually, mark a cross by the name and photograph of one of the 18 candidates running in the historic election and post their voting slip in the ballot box themselves. In the streets, a few low-key posters advise voters not to miss the election. "Vote, take part in the reconstruction of Afghanistan." Another reads: "Your vote will be secret." But the message seems not to be getting through, to go by the reactions of several residents interviewed by AFP. A list of candidates is posted up in Jumay's workshop but he has yet to decide who to vote for. "I've got my card. Don't ask me what the election's all about though, I'm illiterate. Next Saturday I'll vote whichever way everyone else does," the 38-year-old says. At the entrance to the village, another Mohammad family, recently returned from Iran where they lived as refugees, understands how the country's first ever democratic election is going to work but is worried about the process. The father has decided to vote for Karzai, an ethnic Pashtun. His son will back Yunus Qanooni, Karzai's main challenger and an ethnic Tajik. Ghulan, a 36-year-old driver, says the process is open to vote tampering. "Of course they're going to buy votes from the poor. When you're poor like we are, you're not going to turn down 500 afghanis (around 10 dollars) for your vote. "And here, like other places, voters will the same candidate," says the village chief Khan Zada, 47. "Next week we'll decide who it should be."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[China has brought its mobile phone network to the last of its ethnic minority regions previously cut off from communication with the outside world, state media reported Sunday. The district of Drung in the mountainous county of Gongshan in southwestern Yunnan province was connected to the mobile phone network on Saturday -- the last of 55 ethnic minority regions to be hooked up, said Xinhua news agency. "The connection of the network has created good conditions for the Drung community to grow prosperous along with the rest of the Chinese people," Xinhua said. The district has a population of 3,990 spread over an area of 2,000 square kilometers (781 square miles) and is one of the poorest areas in the country, the agency said. The county, which borders northern Myanmar, lies about 500 kilometers (313 miles) from Yunnan's capital city Kunming. The Drung ethnic group, with a total population of only 5,816, is one of the smallest ethnic minorities in China.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Voters in Abkhazia cast ballots Sunday to replace the ailing leader who led the separatist province in its bid for independence from Tbilisi more than a decade ago. Polls opened at 8:00 am (0400 GMT) in the province tucked along the Black Sea coast in Georgia's northwest, news agencies reported. Five men are competing to succeed Vladislav Ardzinba as leader of the republic, which is one of several potential flashpoints in a volatile region where Russia and the West are jostling for influence. Raul Khajimba, a 46-year-old former KGB agent who currently serves as prime minister of the self-styled republic, is considered the front-runner. "It is 90-percent certain that Khajimba will win, since he's Ardzinba's chosen successor," said Alexei Malashenko, a specialist on the Caucasus at the Carnegie Moscow Center. "There's no particular intrigue here." Khajimba was also the only candidate to meet recently with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a sign that Moscow is also tacitly backing him. He was involved in counter-intelligence operations during Abkhazia's 1992-93 war with Tbilisi that resulted in de facto independence that has yet to be recognized by any state. Georgia still considers Abkhazia part of its territory and Georgia's youthful president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has vowed to bring it and another separatist republic, South Ossetia, back under Tbilisi's control. Although Khajimba is widely regarded as the likely victor Sunday, he faces a stiff challenge from Sergei Bagapsh, a wealthy 55-year-old business executive. The other three candidates are Sergei Shamba, a former "foreign minister", Anri Jergeniya, a former "prime minister", and Yakub Lakoba, head of the People's Party. Ardzinba led Abkhzia's fight for independence from Georgia in 1992 and 1993 and became leader of the republic in 1994. Some 120,000 voters are eligible to cast ballots in the election, according to the ITAR-TASS news agency.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[HONG KONG, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A threatened labour shortage in the booming gambling city of Macau became a reality this weekend when a new casino was forced to opened short of staff, a report said Sunday. The Casa Real Casino, the latest gaming centre of gambling tycoon Stanley Ho, opened Saturday without its full complement of croupiers, the South China Morning Post reported. "Our hotels and casinos are all short of staff," Ho, who until this year owned a 40-year monopoly on gambling in the former Portuguese enclave, was reported as saying. "Macau is developing so fast that supporting elements, especially labour, are lagging behind." Since foreign companies were allowed to move into the city's century-old casino market, economists have warned that the tiny southern Chinese enclave would not have enough skilled workers to staff the 20-odd planned casinos. Monthly turnover in Macau's casino market has mushroomed to four-billion patacas (512 million US dollars) over the past year mostly thanks to a surge of tourists from mainland China. The gambling revolution has been led by Sands Macau, the Asian casino of Las Vegas's Venetian Group. It is spearheading a huge new gaming and hotel development on 100,000 square metres of reclaimed land.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Calm returns to Haitian capital by Pierre-Marie Giraud.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PORT-AU-PRINCE, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Calm settled over the Haitian capital early Sunday after two days of political unrest left 10 dead, as aid continued to arrive in flood-ravaged areas in the north. Saturday, armored vehicles of UN peacekeepers were no longer parked in front of the presidential palace or the offices of the prime minister. In Delmas, in the north of the city, a dozen soldiers from the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (Minustah) operated a checkpoint for vehicles coming from the airport. Downtown, only vendors selling fruit and household items from sidewalk stalls hawked their wares, while stores remained shuttered for fear of fresh violence. Eyewitnesses said vehicles were burned and shots were heard late Friday in impoverished Cite Soleil north of the capital, a stronghold of supporters of former president Jean Bertrand Aristide. Haitians heard followers of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue in an animated debate with former lawmakers close to Aristide Saturday over the airwaves of Radio-Caribbean. Aristide is now living in exile in South Africa after stepping down February 29 amid international pressure and the threat of an armed insurrection. Each side accused the other of arming the bands of thugs who killed 10 people, including nine police officers, in the capital Thursday and Friday. All the speakers deplored the police's lack of personnel and resources. Police encircled the radio station for six hours, then arrested and questioned four former parliamentarians close to Aristide, including three who had participated in the debate. A police officer on the scene who requested anonymity said the leaders of Aristide's Lavalas party were suspected of fomenting the violence. The unrest broke out in the Haitian capital Thursday during a demonstration staged by Aristide supporters to mark the thirteenth anniversary of a military coup that ousted him in 1991. Despite the presence of 3,000 UN police and peacekeepers, militant Aristide supporters and opponents have yet to be disarmed. The political situation in the poorest country in the Americas remains fragile ahead of general elections scheduled for 2005. And Haiti is still suffering in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Jeanne, which ravaged the northern city of Gonaives two weeks ago, killing more than 1,500. Flooding left tens of thousands homeless and completely dependent on international aid. Convoys of trucks carrying medicine, drinking water and food leave Port au Prince twice daily headed for Gonaives, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the Haitian capital. Ten tonnes of protein biscuits arrived in Port au Prince late Friday aboard a giant Antonov 124 cargo plane. The first shipment was delivered to Gonaives Saturday, according to Anne Poulsen, spokeswoman for the World Food Program in Haiti. A force of about 3,000 UN peacekeepers, mainly from Latin American nations, have been in Haiti since March seeking to re-establish order. But the political tensions and natural disasters have made their job difficult and UN leaders have expressed concern about conditions in Haiti. Haiti's interim president, Boniface Alexandre, told the UN General Assembly last week that "armed groups are roving around with impunity and show no concern about the presence of MINUSTHA," the UN peacekeeping mission. Efforts to disarm the rival groups have proved largely ineffective and Alexandre called on the UN force to work more closely with the Haitian authorities.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TAIPEI, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Taiwan's Deputy Defense Minister General Houh Shoou-yeh has left for the United States to attend a defense industry meeting, a trip likely to anger rival Beijing which has called on Washington to halt military exchanges with the island. The defense ministry confirmed Houh's departure over the weekend but tried to play down the significance of the meeting he will attend. "It is simply a meeting hosted by a civil organization," said ministry spokesman Huang Suey-sheng. Houh will deliver a keynote speech at the opening of the United States-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona on Sunday, Huang said without providing details. Taiwan's government is to seek parliament's approval for a controversial 18 billion US dollar special defence budget to buy six US-made Pac-3 anti-missile systems, eight conventional submarines and a fleet of submarine-hunting P-3C aircraft, over a 15-year period from 2005. Richard Lawless, a deputy undersecretary at the US Defense Department, will also speak at the conference, according to its organisers the US-Taiwan Business Council. This is the third in a series of conferences addressing the future of US defense cooperation with Taiwan and the defense procurement process. It will provide a progress report on Taiwan's future defense needs and review its communications and command systems, submarine and missile defense programs, the council said. Some critics say Taiwan cannot afford the massive arms spending while others say the new weaponry will not be delivered in time to help the island fend off any attack from China in coming years. Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing in July asked the United States to halt military exchanges and arms sales to Taiwan, given the "seriousness" of the cross-strait standoff. Since pro-independence Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian was re-elected in March, Beijing has stressed its long-standing vow to take Taiwan by force should it declare formal independence. The two sides split in 1949 at the end of a civil war. The United States has remained the leading arms supplier to Taiwan despite switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JERUSALEM, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed Sunday to press ahead with a massive military incursion in the Gaza Strip that has killed almost 60 people in five days. "The operation is progressing in a satisfactory way. Our forces are acting professionally and efficiently. This is not a short operation. We should act for as long as the danger exists," he told Israeli military radio. Israel launched the incursion -- one of the deadliest since the start of the Palestnian uprising four years ago -- in a bid to prevent rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. Overnight, the Israeli army killed three Palestinians, including two militants, in the Jabaliya area of the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian security and hospital sources said, after 11 people were killed on Saturday. The two militants killed were both members of the Al-Qods Brigades, an armed faction of the Islamic Jihad movement, according to witnesses. A total of 58 people, most of them Palestinians, have been killed since about 100 Israeli tanks, backed by aircraft, moved into the northern Gaza Strip in an operation called "Days of Penitence". The operation was intensified after the killing of two young children in an Israeli border town by the makeshift so-called Qassam rockets on Wednesday. The Palestinian cabinet on Saturday declared a state of emergency in the occupied territories, with Yasser Arafat appealing for international help against the Israeli incursion. Arafat called on the world to end the "criminal and racist" Israeli campaign, while shops closed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday in a widely followed strike to protest at the deaths of the Palestinians. Militants of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said they would continue to fire the rockets and would target the Israeli port city of Ashkelon. "The Israeli military operation has failed," a leader of Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades, said at a press conference at the Jabaliya refugee camp, a focal point in the fighting, adding: "We will continue to fire Qassam rockets." However, another Hamas leader later said his group was prepared to stop firing rockets if Israeli forces ended their action in the northern Gaza Strip. "Our sons will stop the firing of Qassam rockets as a means of defence if the Israeli occupier ceases its aggressive incursion and its occupation in the north of the Gaza Strip," said Ismail Haniyeh. Arafat, speaking to journalists outside his headquarters after the emergency cabinet session, said: "I call on the entire world to act immediately and rapidly to stop the criminal and racist" attack launched by the Israeli army. At the same time, he denied that any of the rockets fired at Israel had caused any casualties, contradicting Israeli reports that two children had been killed in the southern Israeli town of Sderot on Wednesday. "These rockets the Israelis are talking about have not killed anyone. and only make noise," he said. A Palestinian cabinet statement called for international intervention, humanitarian help for the people of Gaza and denounced what it called "world silence in the face of the magnitude of crimes committed". Egypt and France joined mounting calls for a halt to the violence while Spain, Switzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Canada also expressed concern and the Arab League said it would hold an emergency session on Sunday. The total toll from the four-year old Palestinian intifada stands at 4,414 dead, most of them Palestinian, according to an AFP tally.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Winner of Afghan election will have fraught future by Jean-Herve Deiller.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[KABUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Whoever wins Afghanistan's landmark presidential election on October 9 will have their work cut out to pull the country back from a quarter century of war and crises. Whether the winner is incumbent Hamid Karzai or one of his challengers, the future president's first problem will be one of legitimacy. A multi-ethnic melting pot, Afghanistan is attempting for the first time since winning independence in 1919 to conduct an exercise in Western-style democracy. But this is alien to local customs, where tribal law has held sway for centuries. Using the ballot box rather than the traditional tribal assemblies, or jirgas, to appoint leaders represents something of a revolution for the country's roughly 10 million voters. Organising the poll has been fraught with problems, including voters registering more than once and fears of intimidation by people representing different social, military and religious groups. Despite being elected president through the ballot box, the winner in the poll will inevitably face accusations that he or she lacks legitimacy and will first have to work hard to build a political majority, probably along ethnic lines. Karzai is perhaps the best placed candidate to manage such a feat. His assured support from the United States -- which has made no secret of its backing for the man it put in power after helping topple the radical Islamic Taliban regime in late 2001 -- further helps his case. A Pon minister Yunus Qanooni, also a candidate in the election. The political schism is not considered irreversible but according to one government insider "the reintegration of the Northern Alliance warlords into the heart of the government is not part of the US strategy of rebuilding Afghanistan". As a result, candidates such as Uzbek general Rashid Dostam and Hazara Mohammed Mohaqiq -- both veterans of the anti-Soviet campaigns of the 1980s and the bloody civil war of 1992-96 -- will find it hard to survive politically in the event of Karzai winning. Afghan factions do not easily form allies and the persistence of military factionalism, if left unchecked, could lead to a new civil war, US-based rights group Human Rights Watch warned in a recent report. One Western diplomat who asked not to be named said: "Despite being brought to power with US backing, supported by the US and running in an election tailor-made for him by the Americans, if elected, Karzai will still have to govern with Afghans."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korea's military and police have tightened security after receiving a fresh Al-Qaeda threat against the country and other US allies which have troops in Iraq, officials said Sunday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff office on Sunday issued an emergency instruction for military units to improve security against possible terrorist attacks. "With all counter-terrorism units put on a high alert, troops operating overseas are ordered to refrain from engaging in activities outside bases under the emergency instruction," an official of the office said. Some 5,000 policemen are also on heightened alert to counter any attacks on key facilities including the American embassy, said the National Police Agency's anti-terror task force. A squad of police commandos was posted near the high-walled and barricaded US embassy in Seoul and police with sniffer dogs stepped up their patrols at airports, the task force said. The foreign ministry on Saturday told embassies overseas to step up security for South Korean interests following a National Security Council meeting on the Al-Qaeda threat. Al-Jazeera television on Friday broadcast a message attributed to Al-Qaeda number two Ayman al-Zawahiri urging Muslims to attack member countries of the US-led coalition in Iraq. The message said: "We should start the resistance from now. The interests of the Americans, English, Australian, French, Polish, Norwegians, South Korean and Japanese are everywhere." South Korea recently sent 2,800 troops to Arbil, a Kurdish-controlled town in the north of Iraq. With another 800 troops to be sent in November, the South Korean contingent makes up the third largest foreign force in the coalition. Islamic militants beheaded a South Korean hostage, Kim Sun-Il, in June after President Roh Moo-Hyun rejected their demand that Seoul scrap its plan to send troops to Iraq. In August a group calling itself Ashap Rayat Sud (Black Banners), linked to the Islamic militant organization Ansar al-Sunna, sent a videotape to Seoul, threatening to attack South Korean troops and citizens in retaliation. Ansar al-Sunna has claimed responsibility for many attacks, including a suicide bombing which killed at least 105 in Arbil in February.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MADISON, Mississippi, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Fred Funk shot an eight-under par 64 to seize a one-stroke lead after the third round of the three million dollar PGA Southern Farm Bureau Classic on Saturday. Funk goes into the fourth round looking to become the second straight player over the age of 40 to win the event. John Huston, 42, became the fifth 40-plus champion at the Annandale Golf Club in 2003. "I really enjoy playing here," said the 48-year-old Funk. "I've had nice success here in the past." Huston lost his chance of defending after missing the cut. Funk, who won the event in 1998, opened the round with a birdie and closed it with two more, collecting seven birdies. Entering at 40th on the money list, he eagled the par-five fifth hole after bogeying the second hole and followed with three consecutive birdies. "I made a lot of birdies today and one eagle," said Funk. "I finally hit the fairway on No. 5. The last time I played it, I think I missed it every time. I got my eagle and got rewarded on it today. "Obviously, everyone is making lots of birdies, so you have to get as many as you can. I still have to go low tomorrow to have a chance at winning this." Chris Couch carded two birdies Saturday while adding an eagle on No. 7. He is tied with Steve Pate for second place after shooting 68. Pate shot a three-under with four birdies and a bogey. The 43-year-old Pate has not won a tournament on the PGA Tour since the 1998 CVS Charity Classic.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[EU set to give Turkey green light, but long road ahead by Michael Thurston.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The European Commission will this week publish a long-awaited report widely expected to give Turkey a green light to start EU entry talks, but warning that there is a long and potentially bumpy road ahead. The European Union (EU) executive, whose findings will form the basis of a decision by EU leaders at a December summit, notably forecasts that the vast Muslim country cannot hope to join the bloc until well into the next decade. And the crunch report, to be unveiled in Brussels on Wednesday, will also list a series of areas where Turkey's reforms fall short, notably on human rights issues including torture, according to leaked elements of its findings. "Accession of Turkey to the Union would be challenging both for the EU and Turkey. If well managed, it would offer important opportunities for both," said an impact study expected to be approved alongside the main recommendations. Turkey first forged links with the European bloc over four decades ago, but in the last few years has pushed hard to actually start formal EU membership negotiations. Opponents of such a move have long argued that Turkey is simply too big and too different to fit into the EU. But EU leaders agreed in Copenhagen two years to decide in December 2004 whether or not to start those talks. And despite public skepticism notably in countries like France and Germany, and a firm hold-out by Austria, it appears increasingly likely that the EU will give the thumbs up next month, albeit with an array of caveats and warnings. This week's report is expected to point firmly in that direction, by giving a strong endorsement of the reforms pushed through by the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan since he took power two years ago. "Following decades of sporadic progress and partly because of a political consolidation after the 2002 elections, there has been a substantial institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards," said another part of the report leaked to the press ahead of its formal publication. But Brussels has also made clear that areas of serious concern remain. "Although torture is no longer systematic, numerous cases of torture and in particular ill-treatment still continue to occur and further efforts will be required to eradicate such practice," it said. Meanwhile another couple of clouds are looming over Turkey's hopes: notably a row leading the EU to boycott a meeting in Istanbul this week because Turkey insisted on formally inviting the breakaway Turkish enclave of northern Cyprus. Officials in Ankara were quick to dismiss fears that the spat would have an adverse impact on the EU decision, but there is little doubt it will not help the atmosphere. And another fly in the ointment came on Friday when French President Jacques Chirac said he backs a constitutional change tothe European Institute in Florence, Italy. "They will drag their feet, but the leaders will take a positive decision. because the costs of a 'no' today are much bigger than the costs of a 'yes,' which will only be felt in 10 or 15 years," he added.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The EU's decision on whether or not to start membership talks with Turkey comes four decades after the signing of a agreement of association between Ankara and Brussels in 1963. Following is a chronology of the ups and downs in Turkey's march towards EU membership. - September 12, 1963: Turkey signs an association agreement with the European Economic Community with provisions for a gradual lowering of customs barriers as a preliminary to full membership of the EEC, precursor of the European Union. - 1980-1986: The association is suspended following a military coup in Turkey. - April 14, 1987: Turkey applies for EU membership. - December 18, 1989: The European Commission rejects Turkey's application, citing economic and political difficulties. - March 6, 1995: Ankara and Brussels sign an agreement on a customs union, providing for the removal of import duties and closer economic cooperation. The customs union, which comes into effect in January 1996, encounters financial difficulties, largely on account of reservations by Athens. - July 15, 1997: The European Commission recommends opening membership talks with five eastern European countries and Cyprus but excluding Turkey. Turkey's human rights record is considered a major obstacle to membership. - December 12-13, 1997: The 15 EU heads of state and government confirm their decision to enlarge the Union to several eastern European countries and Cyprus, but persist in excluding Turkey. - December 14, 1997: Ankara breaks off political dialogue with the European Union, in particular over issues relating to Greece and Cyprus. - October 13, 1999: The European Commission recommends including Turkey in the list of candidate members, extended to six eastern European countries and Malta, but without entering into negotiations for membership. - December 10, 1999: Turkey is granted candidate status at an EU summit at Helsinki. But the EU says negotiations will not begin until Turkey meets certain democracy and human rights conditions. - Turkey is in the meantime invited as an observer at EU summits, and also participates in a convention which drafted a first-ever EU constitution, designed as a rule-book to avoid institutional paralysis in the expanding bloc. - December 2002: EU leaders meeting in Copenhagen pledged to take a decision in December 2004 on whether or not to start EU accession negotiations with Ankara. If approved, the talks would start "without delay," it said. The EU heads of government agreed that they would base their decision on recommendations made by the European Commission.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Steve Finley's grand slam capped a seven-run ninth inning as Los Angeles captured their first division title since 1995 with a 7-3 win over the division rivals San Francisco. After entering the closing weekend with a three-game cushion over the Giants in the National League West Division, Los Angeles didn't help their cause by dropping a 4-2 decision on Friday. The Giants could have closed to within a game of the Dodgers as they entered the ninth with a three-run lead. But pitcher Dustin Hermanson loaded the bases with one out before giving up his third walk of the inning to South Korean pinch hitter Hee Seop Choi, forcing in Dodgers' first run. "I made some good pitches that inning," said Hermanson. "I'm not going to make any excuses, I just couldn't get the job done. I wore out a little easier today." Manager Felipe Alou brought in Wayne Franklin, whose second pitch to Finley landed in the right field seats to end the Giants chances of a third straight NL West title. "I was just looking to hit the ball to the outfield, but I got a pitch to hit," Finley said. The grand slam gave Los Angeles its NL-leading 53rd comeback win of the year, breaking the franchise record.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[EU governments strain to lead public over Turkish bid by Michael Thurston.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[As the European Commission prepares to publish a crunch report on Turkey's EU hopes, political leaders' and public opinions seem strikingly divided over the prospect of admitting the vast Muslim country. While the majority of European Union (EU) governments are broadly in favour of Ankara's accession, criticism notably comes from opposition parties and public opinion in key European countries. And the stakes of the public-political split have been raised by French President Jacques Chirac's backing for a constitutional change to allow the French people to vote on the matter. The main arguments against Ankara's bid centre on its sheer size, which will in theory give Turkey as much power as heavyweights like Germany and France, as well as the cost, which Brussels says could be up to 27.5 billion euros (34 billion dollars). Others fear mass immigration from Turkey, while culturally many question whether a country whose population is 95 percent Muslim can realistically be integrated with a bloc whose heritage is broadly Christian. Those backing Turkey argue it is an essential bridgehead between the West and the Muslim world, helping spread stability in a volatile region, while underlining the economic opportunities offered. Of those in favour, Britain is among the most supportive, with Prime Minister Tony Blair saying Ankara's EU entry would be "important for Turkey, important for Europe, and important for Britain too". Italy's Silvio Berlusconi is also a key backer, although a key member of his ruling coalition is strongly against. The Spanish government's favourable view of talks with Turkey is shared by the opposition Popular Party. French President Chirac has voiced support once Turkey meets "all the necessary conditions," but on Friday called for a study into constitutional changes so that the entry of all new EU states must be subject to a referendum. A French poll last week indicated that 56 percent of French people oppose Turkish EU entry, with only 36 percent in favour. Other polls have showed similiar trends: in Denmark 49 percent are against, compared to 31 percent in favour, while in Lithuania fewer than one in three people back Turkey's EU hopes. Chirac seems determined to press ahead. "We have an interest in having Turkey with us," he said after talks with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Paris. "It opens the perspective of democracy and peace taking root on the whole of the European continent -- in the wider sense of the term -- so that we avoid the mistakes and violence of the past," he said. Schroeder said he shared the French position on Turkish entry. Of all EU member states, Austria is the most opposed, with Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel urging that the EU "digest" its latest wave of enlargement in May this year before engaging in a further round of enlargement. The opposition is also against, and a recent opinion poll found 76 percent of Austrians are against Turkey's accession. Opposition also comes from inside the Commission itself, which is to publish its recommendations Wednesday on whether Turkey should be allowed to start entry negotiations with the EU. Two commissioners -- Dutch interior market chief Frits Bolkestein and Austria's Franz Fischler, who holds the farm brief -- have in recent weeks voice their doubts. Bolkestein notably cited an American Islamic expert as forecasting that by the end of the 21st century Europe will be mostly Islamic, due to migration flows and democraphic trends. "I don't know if it will go in this direction, but if he is right, the liberation of Vienna in 1683 would have been in vain," he said, referring to the event which turned the tide of the Ottoman Empire's advance on Europe.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Kerry puts Bush on defensive, a month before election by Stephen Collinson.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A month before the US election, President George W. Bush suddenly faces a fight for his political life, after a resurgent John Kerry staved off elimination and hauled himself back into the game. The Democratic candidate was celebrating his best week on the campaign trail in months as a Newsweek poll suggested he had not only wiped out Bush's modest lead, but surged into a slim advantage himself. Now he enters a critical 10 days, with two more debates with Bush, on October 8 and 13, and a vice-presidential debate on Tuesday. Bush aides had hoped their man could nail Kerry in last Thursday's first presidential face-off -- and effectively end the race. But now they must be wondering whether Bush played his trump card too soon, after pushing for the initial debate to be on foreign policy, supposed to be the president's most solid territory. According to the Newsweek poll, and other snap surveys after the confrontation, Kerry was the clear winner, and dented support for the president's stewardship of the Iraq war and the global anti-terror campaign. Though some analysts scored the event a draw, it evidently changed the dynamic in the race and presented voters with a clear choice. "Bush has managed to make the campaign about Kerry even though he is not the incumbent," said Jonathan Siegel, a law professor at George Washington University. "And this (the debate) took it back to being, 'What is the Bush record and do we really want more of the same.'" Kerry has, according to some observers, closed the credibility gap with Bush, who as an incumbent has the power, prestige and trappings of the presidency to lord over his opponent. The debate has raised some comparisons to a contest in the 1980 presidential campaign, when underestimated Republican Ronald Reagan passed his own test en-route to turfing Jimmy Carter out of the White House. Kerry's debate performance seemed to release weeks of pent-up tension, as he appeared looser and more confident on the stump. "I have always had a feeling about the end of September when the leaves begin to change, the air gets a little cooler, my political juices start to flow," said Kerry at a fundraiser with wealthy donors Saturday night. Kerry's reputation as a "good closer" has become almost cliched but he does appear to be gathering steam. Aides said Saturday that Kerry would now link Bush's perceived failings over Iraq to his economic management. "Time and again, George Bush has proven that he's stubborn, out of touch and unwilling to change course. he confuses staying in place with leadership. "But it's not just in Iraq. Over the past four years he has made a series of serious misjudgments here at home," Kerry said in Florida on Saturday. And Democrats say they are ready for a wave of Republican attacks : "if you punch us, we will punch back harder," warned Democratic National Committee chairman in a more polished performance at the next debate after he was caught on cut-away shots at the University of Miami on Thursday scowling. Friday's encounter is a town-hall style meeting, which may play into Bush's ability to connect with average Americans. Kerry has struggled with that format. But there must be some concern that the president's tried and tested tactic of sticking relentlessly to his core message has come unstuck. Bush's frequent repetitions in the first debate made Kerry seem nimble by comparison. And when the Democrat failed to match the caricature of negative attack ads, he may have gained in stature as a result. "I think the reason everybody is in such a good mood and applauding is, that you're thrilled I can complete a sentence in 15 words or less," Kerry joked to supporters on Saturday.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Turkey in facts and figures.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ANKARA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Turkey, which hopes to get the nod Wednesday from the European Commission to obtain a date in December to launch membership talks with the European Union, stands at the center of a strategic zone between the Caucasus, the Middle East and the Balkans. Following is a factsheet on Turkey, comparing some figures with those of the European Union: GEOGRAPHY: Covering an area of 779,452 square kilometres (311,781 square miles), Turkey borders Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Greece and Bulgaria, and is washed by the Mediterranean to the south, the Aegean to the west and the Black Sea to the north, and surrounds the Sea of Marmara. It is divided between two continents, Europe and Asia. The area west of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus (the straits between Europe and Asia) accounts for five percent of the total. Comparatively, the total area of the EU countries is 3,691,214 sq km (1,476,486 sq miles). POPULATION: 70.7 million inhabitants (2003), including 13 to 19 million Kurds. With Turkey joining, the EU's population, which stood at 455 million in January 2004, would pass the half-billion mark. CAPITAL: Ankara, population 3.5 million. Istanbul is the country's largest city and industrial and commercial hub with a population in excess of 10 million (Turkish State Statistics Institute, 2000 - latest figures available). OFFICAL LANGUAGE: Turkish. The EU currently has 20 official, but only three working languages: English, French and German. RELIGION: Muslim (99 percent): 80 percent Sunni, 20 percent Alevi. Armenians form the largest religious minority, with about 45,000 people, followed by some 35,000 Jews. Turkey's entry into the EU would bring the number of Muslims in the European bloc to around 80 million. RECENT HISTORY: Founded in 1923, the Republic of Turkey was created after the collapse of the Ottoman empire at the end of World War I. The republic became a modern secular state under its founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk ("father of the Turks"), until his death in 1938. His successor, Ismet Inonu, ran the counry as a single-party dictatorship until 1946, when he introduced a multi-party system. Turkey was the scene of military coups, followed by periods of repression, in 1960, 1971 and 1980. From 1984 to 1999, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) led an armed rebellion in southeastern Turkey, which claimed more than 37,000 lives. The PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and many other countries and international organisations, called a unilateral truce after the capture in Kenya in 1999 of its founder and leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who was tried and sentenced to death; his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. The PKK has changed names several times since, and its latest incarnation, the Kurdistan People's Congress (KONGRA-GEL), in June announced the end of thin March 2003. ECONOMY: The economy, which is based mainly on textiles, light industry, tourism and agriculture, saw considerable growth until it was hit by a severe crisis in the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991. With 14 million foreign visitors generating 13.2 billion dollars of income, tourism in 2003 was the country's biggest earner. Long hit by PKK terror attacks and the effects of the Gulf War, the sector boomed in 2003 and 2004, with incoming tourist figures increasing by 43.5% for the first six months of this year compared with the first six months of 2003. Turkey has been linked with the EU with an association accord signed in 1963 and a customs agreement signed in 1996. Turkey's candidacy for EU membership was rejected in 1989, largely due to its human rights record, but was accepted on December 10, 1999. GNP PER CAPITA: 2.790 dollars. By comparison, the highest per capita GNP in the EU belongs to Luxembourg, with 38,830 dollars; n Hamid Reza Asefi was quoted as saying. "The brutal slaughter of innocent people in the Gaza Strip has further exposed the inhuman nature of Zionist regime's leaders to the public." Israel has been conducing a massive and bloody incursion into the northern Gaza Strip centred on Jabaliya since late Tuesday, with some 59 Palestinians killed so far. Israel asserts the operation is aimed at preventing rocket attacks against its territory.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[First commercial spacecraft set for bid to clinch big prize by Marc Lavine.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A private US spaceship is set to blast off for the second time in five days Monday in the final stage of an attempt to clinch a 10-million-dollar prize aimed at launching a new era of space tourism. SpaceShipOne is the frontrunner to win the coveted Ansari X Prize that organisers hope will spawn an age of space travel rivalling the dawn of commercial air transport in the late 1920s. "What we finally have here, after 40 years of waiting, is the beginning of the personal space flight revolution," said Peter Diamandis, president of the X Prize foundation. The stubby rocket plane SpaceShipOne in June became the world's first ever manned space vessel not funded by a government, shifting the paradigm of celestial exploration and marking the start of a new space race. Wednesday, test pilot Mike Melvill took it on its second successful -- if hair-raising -- foray out of the earth's atmosphere that simultaneously bedazzled and horrified onlookers. After a heart-stopping corkscrew ride into the sky, SpaceShipOne burst out of the earth's atmosphere and reached an altitude of 37,500 feet, or 103 kilometers (64 miles), qualifying for the last phase of the X Prize competition. Melvill then glided the craft back to earth for a text-book landing, before proclaiming a "near perfect" flight, despite his unintentional "victory roll" that saw SpaceShipOne spin up to two dozen times during its ascent. Travelling at speeds of up to 3,500 kilometers (2,100 miles) an hour, SpaceShipOne's seemingly uncontrollable rolls spooked team members and television viewers across the world. But at around 7:00 am (1400 GMT) on Monday, the ship will again take off from California's Mojave desert on the belly of a specially-adapted jet to complete its prize bid with its second flight into space within two weeks. If all goes well, organisers, including aviation pioneer and SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan, say the craft will blast off from its carrier jet, White Knight, just over an hour later, before punching out into space. The pilot, who has not yet been named, will be weightless for around 3.5 minutes, before completing his arc-like ascent and reentering earth's atmosphere ahead of a runway landing scheduled for 8:30 am. If the craft again breaches the 328,000-foot (62-mile; 100-kilometer) barrier, the SpaceShipOne team lead by Rutan will claim the Ansari X Prize purse ahead of any of the two dozen other competitors eyeing the bounty. Rutan selected the October 4 date to coincide with the 47th anniversary of the 1957 launch of the Soviet Union's first satellite, Sputnik I, which sparked the original space race between Moscow and Washington. Rutan confirmed the launch would go ahead as scheduled Monday after examining data from Wednesday's flight to ensure that the craft's vertical roll was not the result of not the craft succeeds in Monday's second attempt to snag the X Prize, organisers said the competition's true goal had already been achieved and that the first buds of commercial space travel were already burgeoning. Last week Rutan and British tycoon Richard Branson announced a 14-million-pound (25-million-dollar) tie-up between Virgin Atlantic Airways and Mojave Aerospace Ventures to set up Virgin Galactic, the first company to offer the public trips into space using SpaceShipOne's technology. And Rutan and X Prize chiefs said Virgin Galactic was just the beginning. "The fact that this has gone so well -- I have to pinch myself," Rutan said, predicting that within the next few years manufacturers will be producing low-cost spaceships to service customers who are already lining up for the first paying sub-orbital flights. "I believe they just don't know it yet," he said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[American League MVP candidate Vladimir Guerrero blasted a two-run homer and three Oakland relievers combined to squander a two-run lead as Anaheim clinched the AL West with a 5-4 win over the A's. Entering the season-ending three-game series with Anaheim tied for first place in the AL West, the Athletics received a poor performance from 17-game winner Mark Mulder in Friday's 10-0 loss. With the season on the line, Oakland turned to a former Cy Young Award winner Barry Zito on Saturday to keep alive its hopes. Zito limited the Angels to two runs and three hits with a walk and three strikeouts. The lefthander, who retired 11 straight before Chone Figgins' one-out single in the fifth, threw 114 pitches - 72 for strikes. But with a 4-2 lead after seven, Oakland manager Ken Macha turned to the bullpen, bringing in Jim Mecir. The righthander allowed two of the three batters he faced to reach before being lifted. Southpaw Ricardo Rincon and Octavio Dotel couldn't get the job done either. Brendan Donnelly (5-2) benefited from Oakland's stumble after tossing 1 2/3 scoreless innings. Francisco Rodriguez struck out the side around a walk in the eighth before closer Troy Percival posted his 33rd save. Figgins scored two runs for Anaheim, who won the AL West for the first time since 1986.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Admitting mainly Muslim Turkey into the European Union would mark nothing short of a cultural, economic and political revolution for Europe, analysts say. Accepting the vast country, with its explosive combination of poverty and a burgeoning population, into the bloc would also throw up the basic question of what are the limits of the expanding Union. With a population predicted at 73 million in 2005 alone, Turkey would immediately leap up alongside EU heavyweight Germany, and ahead of France and Britain in terms of voting rights and seats in the European Parliament. The country is already bigger than the 10 mostly ex-communist states which joined the EU this year put together. The UN predicts it will have 82 million inhabitants by 2015 -- widely cited as a target date for Turkey's EU entry. The strategic argument for this year's expansion eastwards was to re-unite a continent divided after World War II. Turkey's backers say admitting Ankara is essential to build a bridge between the West and the volatile Middle East. "It is necessary. that after the opening to the East, Europe now turns toward the South so that it can again become the link between the Western world and the Orient," said former French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn. On the economic front, although Turkey has made vigorous progress for the last few years, the country has a huge backlog to make up with the Union, in particular in its farming sector. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capital remains barely a quarter of the 25-member EU's, at 6,356 euros (7,878 dollars) compared to 22,278 euros (27,612 dollars). This huge imbalance means it will cost the EU's current states dear at the start, notably in terms of subsidies dished out under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Outgoing EU farm commissioner Franz Fischler said the EU would have to spend some 11.3 billion euros per year on farm aid alo on Friday in Oslo. Observers have said they expect the Nobel committee this year to hail efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[FALLUJAH, Iraq, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US warplanes pounded the Iraqi insurgent-held town of Fallujah on Sunday for a third time in just over 24 hours in an ongoing push to wrest hotspots from rebel hands ahead of January elections. The pre-dawn strike took place just hours after US and Iraqi officials said Samarra, another violence-wracked city, was largely under control after one of their largest post-war military offensives in the country. Despite such attempts to crush the insurgency, militant groups continued holding scores of foreigners hostage, including a Jordanian, two French journalists and a British engineer who have all been threatened with death. A senior US military official, however, warned that the militants' shock tactics, such as a wave of car bombings last week that killed scores of children, had the potential to backfire by uniting world opinion against them. The outskirts of Fallujah were smouldering again after US warplanes bombed a building where the military said between 10 and 15 insurgents suspected of links with Iraq's most wanted man Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi had been shifting weapons. "A large number of enemy fighters are presumed killed," the army said, without giving an exact toll. The latest onslaught followed two earlier missions around the Sunni Arab enclave west of Baghdad again targeting suspected Zarqawi hideouts. In the latest attack, the US military insisted that special measures were taken to ensure no civilians were caught up in the blasts but it was impossible immediately to verify the casualty situation on the ground. Several women and children were among those killed and wounded in an earlier strike Friday, according to hospital officials. Meanwhile in Samarra, a key bastion in the Sunni insurgent belt north of the Iraqi capital, hospital officials were still attending the dead after a massive US-Iraqi offensive on Friday and into Saturday that killed at least 125 people. Corpses in black bags at the city's general hospital were being carried out for burial. "We cleaned up the city from all the bad guys and terrorists," Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib told reporters on Saturday. Speaking at city hall, Naqib said the mission was the most successful to date, and hinted at further action to regain control of other no-go areas. Asked if Fallujah would be next on the list, the minister said: "I would like to say today rather than tomorrow. we would be able to do that. "Fallujah has to come back to Iraq. we want all Iraqis to participate in the elections." But a leading Sunni Muslim religious group questioned the logic of using brute force to achieve democratic goals. "Resorting to iron and fire to prepare for elections is a flawed method," the Committee of Muslim Scholars said. Desperate to thwart the US-led efforts to rebuild Iraq following last year's invasion and the creation of agest Muslim nation. And French President Jacques Chirac slammed a failed private initiative to secure the release of two French journalists held hostage since August 20. US Brigadier General Erv Lessel, chief spokesman for the US-led forces in Iraq, said the militants may regret their grisly actions. "The tactic of increasingly violent and shocking terrorist acts has the potential to backfire by increasingly turning Iraqi and world public opinion against the terrorists," Lessel told AFP. Meanwhile, a blame game over alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction that have never been found continued, with The New York Times reporting that the administration of President George W. Bush was made aware as early as 2001 that aluminum tubes used as critical evidence to justify an invasion were most likely not for nuclear weapons.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[John Lennon's killer faces possible release by Alfons Luna.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Mark Chapman, the man who gunned down John Lennon in New York, could be released from jail this week -- a prospect that has drawn protests and even threats against his life from the former Beatle's fans. Chapman, now 49, was sentenced to 20 years to life after shooting Lennon five times in the back outside the singer's Manhattan apartment building on December 8, 1980. Having served 24 years, Chapman has a parole hearing scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the State of New York Division of Parole said. It will be the third hearing for Chapman, whose previous requests to be set free were turned down in 2000 and 2002. On the last occasion, the parole board ruled that release would "deprecate the seriousness" of his crime. Opposition to paroling Chapman has been led by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, who has argued that he continues to pose a risk to herself and her family. Lennon fans have also organised an online petition calling for Chapman to remain in prison for the rest of his natural life. "Chapman committed a heinous crime, unprovoked and without remorse. He shot to death John Lennon, a man who had signed an autograph for him only six hours earlier. He deserves to pay for this with life in prison," the petition says. "It is also a matter of public safety that he not be released. He should not be free to harm anyone else. Please remember that Mark David Chapman is forty-nine years old, and John Lennon never got to be older than forty." Comments attached to the petition, which has garnered close to 2,000 signatures, ranged from reasoned arguments for keeping Chapman locked up, to threatening rants against his life. "By no means whatsoever should this sick waste of oxygen and bone marrow be released for the crime he committed," said Charles Martina of Rome, New York. "May he rot in jail and the fiery pits of hell forever." John Davies, of New York, said Chapman should remain in prison "for his own safety," while another signatory, identified only as Kelsey, was even more direct, saying "I'll kill him myself if he doesn't stay in jail." In 1990, Chapman expressed his remorse for having killed Lennon but his first parole request in 2000 was denied because board members said he still had the same desire for "fame and notoriety" that led to the murder. Two years ago, the board noted Chapman's "very positive" behavioural record, but added that progress in such a controlled and structured environment "cannot predict your community behaviour" if released. In a rare interview several years ago with the British press, Chapman, who is serving his time in Attica maximum security prison in northern New York state, said he was sure that Lennon would have forgiven him and wished his release. "I think he would be liberal, I think he would care," he said. This year marked the 40th anniversary since The Beatles, on the back of their first US number one, flew into New York for a tour that took America by storm and heralded the start of the "British invasion" of the US music charts. Only two of the Fab Four, Lennon's songwriting partner Paul McCartney and drummer Ringo Starr, are still alive. George Harrison died of cancer in 2001.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush and Kerry spar over Iraq, but economy looms large by Jean-Louis Doublet.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MANSFIELD, Ohio, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President George W. Bush, seeking a second term, and Democratic challenger John Kerry, have been sparring energetically over Iraq, but both men are keenly aware of the US economy looming large as a major campaign issue in the November 2 election. The economy will be the central theme of their second televised debate in St. Louis, Missouri, on October 8, just 25 days before the election. The first debate last Thursday night, on security and foreign policy, gave Kerry a boost in voter preference. On Saturday, the first poll since the debate gave the senator from Massachusetts a 49-46 percent edge over Bush in a two-way matchup, and a 47-45 percent margin in a race also involving independent Ralph Nader. Also on Saturday, Bush promised to sign into law a tax cut for the middle class that was recently passed by Congress. "I will proudly sign the Working Families Tax Relief Act. This bipartisan law is good news for America's families," Bush said in his weekly radio address, noting that Kerry had voted against tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. For his part, Kerry blames Bush's tax cuts for pushing the federal deficit to a record 422 billion dollars. The Democratic challenger says that if elected he will revoke the tax cuts for those earning more than 200,000 dollars a year and use the proceeds for health and education. "We can continue to give massive tax giveaways to the wealthiest few in our country," Kerry said in Orlando, Florida. "Or we can fight for the families who are working hard every day, offering middle-class tax cuts that make work pay." Here in Mansfield, Bush countered that, "When you hear (Kerry) say tax the rich, just remember that the rich hire lawyers and accountants for a reason, to slip the bill to you. The good news is that we're not going to let him tax you. I'll win in November with your help." Earlier in Columbus, Ohio, Bush defended his record, saying the economy was resurging and the unemployment rate, at 5.4 percent, was the lowest in decades. The Democrats say Bush is the first president in 30 years on whose watch more jobs have been lost than created, putting the jobs deficit at one million. States like Ohio have been especially hard-hit by the weak industrial sector in recent years. Bush won Ohio in 2000 with a narrow 3.6 percent more votes than Democratic challenger Al Gore, and this year, the Democrats see a Kerry victory here within their sights. Bush has been campaigning hard in the state. He was here last Monday, and made three more appearances on Saturday. The US media were meanwhile crediting Kerry with victory over Bush in the Thursday night debate on security and foreign policy, themes that voters generally see as the president's strong suits. Bush could also find himself on the defensive in the second debate Friday night, faced with relentless attacks on his economic record by Kerry, who voters generally see as better qualified on the economy, health and retirement. Karl Rove, Bush's closest political advisor, said Saturday the election would be very close, and that he was expecting the gap between the candidates to narrow still further. That, he said, would have nothing to do with Kerry's showing Thursday, but was just "the nature of the race."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[All will profit from Turkey-EU partnership, Turk analysts say by Nicolas CHEVIRON.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ISTANBUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[While debate rages among European Union members over whether Turkey has a place in their bloc or not, analysts here agree that both sides can expect nothing but benefit from a future partnership. "If it becomes a member, Turkey will be an El Dorado for large European industry," predicted Bulent Akarcali, a former liberathe theory that the cost of Turkish membership would be an immense financial burden on the EU. Farming Commissioner Franz Fischler predicted last month that the cost of integrating Turkish agriculture alone would cost the Union 11.3 billion euros (13.9 billion dollars). "Turks will be well aware when they begin negotiating that the EU is no longer the growth engine it once was and does not have much to offer to Turkey in that field," Akat said. Turkey's major gain from EU membership, he said, will be that "this will render economic and political reform irreversible and bring stability to the country, attracting large amounts of foreign investment." This, in turn, will "transform Turkey into a 'Mediterranean Dragon'," he said, referring to the four Asian Dragons -- Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea -- that saw major economic booms in the eighties with their export-oriented industries. The geopolitical benefits to Europe of having Turkey as a member aree asked, referring to the projected percentage of Turkish representation in the EU parliament. As for arguments that Turkey's arrival would make a strong, politically integrated Europe impossible, he said: "It's already too late for that -- if that's what it wanted, the EU should have had the courage to say no to Poland and the Baltic states."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[White House aspirant John Kerry's plan to hold direct talks with North Korea to end its nuclear weapons drive may turn up the heat on President George W. Bush and force him to revamp his policy toward the Stalinist state if reelected, analysts say. Kerry pledged during the first televised presidential debate last week that if he won the November 2 vote, he would seek a no-holds barred bilateral dialogue with Pyongyang -- not only on the nuclear question but the equally sensitive human rights issue as well. His plan to directly engage North Korea is seen by analysts as more pragmatic compared to Bush's current policy of having multilateral negotiations with Pyongyang confined purely on the nuclear issue. After about a year and three rounds of talks, the six-party forum hosted by China and also involving the United States, the two Koreas, Japan and Russia has hit a stalemate, with North Korea refusing to return to the negotiating table and instead vowing to step up its nuclear drive. "There is no question that Kerry's approach would hasten the solution of the problem as bilateral negotiations could provide a framework for getting into some of those underlying issues critical to solving the crisis," said James Moltz, deputy director of the center for non-proliferation studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. But if Bush is reelected, he could come under pressure to change his hardline North Korean policy, Moltz said, citing Pyongyang's ballooning nuclear threat and new uncertainties introduced by South Korea's own nuclear ambitions. Bush is against official talks with North Korea, saying the five nation coalition engaging North Korea under the six-party talks has been effective and that "China's leverage on Kim Jong-Il" was imperative. The Bush administration had scrapped a 1994 bilateral nuclear accord with North Korea after it allegedly pursued an atomic weapons program. Kerry wants to continue consultations with North Korea's neighbors while Washington puts all contentious bilateral issues on the table with Pyongyang. They would cover nuclear, human rights, economic, artillery disposal and demilitarized zone issues as well as a 1953 armistice signed by the United States, North Korea and China. The treaty ended the Korean War but failed to bring permanent peace to the Korean peninsula. More than 50,000 US soldiers died in the war, sparked by North Korea's invasion of its southern neighbor. "The Bush approach is not a good strategy because he's focussing on just the nuclear weapons. The North Koreans are not going to give those up unless they get something in return that's pretty good," said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "But you also can't buy out those weapons. So the only solution is broaden the discussions -- as Kerry has proposed -rism and lifting of economic sanctions. The United States refused to budge and its stand was perceived by North Korea as defying the 'words for words' and 'action for action' spirit agreed upon at the last round of the six-party talks. Fred Carriere, executive director of The Korea Society, said the Bush administration's ineffective North Korean policy boiled down to its failure to win the trust of the North Koreans. "The idea that within the larger context, the two parties (US and North Korea) whose interest is most at issue would not engage in direct one-on-one talks defies centuries of diplomatic practice and the idea of just using sticks and no incentives also defies centuries of diplomatic practice," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GUWAHATI, India, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[India's insurgency-racked northeast was reeling on Sunday from one of its deadliest waves of violence in years, with police reporting killings overnight that brought the death toll to 53 with 141 injured. A string of bloody blasts and shootouts in adjoining Assam and Nagaland states on Saturday killed at least 44 people. Overnight another five victims died in hospital while four others were killed in fresh violence, police said on Sunday. In New York, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan strongly condemned the bombings and gunfire attacks, saying he had learnt of the violence with "shock and dismay". The attacks began as India was commemorating on Saturday the birth of the country's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, a champion of non-violence. Nagaland authorities blamed the attacks on rebels seeking to disrupt the peace process between the authorities and separatist rebels. The bloodshed began early on Saturday in Dimapur, the commercial hub of Nagaland, when three bombs exploded almost simultaneously in what an official called the "worst ever terrorist strike" in the tiny state's history. Police said the plastic explosive RDX appeared to have been used in a powerful blast at a railway station in Dimapur that dug out a large crater next to a platform packed with passengers awaiting a train. "There were limbs everywhere and blood was splattered all over," said student leader T. Zheviho. Later on Saturday, one person was killed when gunmen fired on a train near Bagmari village in eastern Assam's Karbi Anglong district. In one of the worst strikes in Assam, gunmen on Saturday shot at shoppers in a market at Makri Jhora village, 290 kilometres (180 miles) west of the main city of Guwahati. Police said 11 were killed and 12 injured. Fifteen more people were wounded on Sunday when rebels lobbed a grenade at shoppers in a teeming market in northern Assam's Sonitpur district, 180 kilometres (112 miles) from Guwahati, a police spokesman said. And in another incident, three militants from the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) were killed when an explosive device they were planting exploded in northern Assam's Darrang district early on Sunday, police said. Services were planned on Sunday in churches across Nagaland, which has a large Christian population, to pray for the 28 people killed in the three bomb blasts that rocked Dimapur. "We're in a state of shock and disbelief. The only way we can heal the wounds is by offering prayers in memory of the departed and for the well being of those who lived," said G. Ginam, a ades of fighting between security forces and rebel groups who accuse New Delhi of exploiting the area's natural resource wealth.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Australian PM confident in final election week (RECASTS adding Latham quotes, background).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The final week of Australia's October 9 election began Sunday with conservative Prime Minister John Howard confident of winning a fourth term and opposition leader Mark Latham embracing the underdog tag. Opinion polls published Sunday showed the contest remained a virtual dead heat, with analysts saying up to 25 percent of voters would not decide how to cast their ballot until the election campaign's last days. A poll of marginal electorates published in the Sun-Herald newspaper gave the opposition Labor Party a comfortable 54 percent to 46 percent lead over Howard's Liberal-National coalition. But a Sunday Telegraph survey said Labor had failed to make inroads in the marginal seats, giving the conservative government a lead of 51.5 percent to 48.5 percent. The conflicting results highlight the volatility of electoral sentiment in what pollsters say has been a difficult campaign to read. Howard, who will lose power in the 150-seat parliament with a swing of 2.2 percent against him, said for the first time Sunday he believed he was heading for victory, after previously describing the election as too close to call. "I think we'll make it but it's very close," Howard told television station Channel Nine. "It always was going to be close -- we only have a margin of eight seats and that is a tiny margin in a house of 150." Latham, who at 43 is 22 years Howard's junior and fighting his first campaign as leader compared with Howard's fifth, claimed underdog status but said the opinion polls could not be relied on. "These polls are so radically different that obviously some pollsters are going to be out of work next week," he told Channel Seven. "Labor goes into the final week as underdogs, we are against an incumbent government with a huge advertising budget." Sunday marked the last event of the country's domestic sporting season -- the rugby league grand final -- and conventional wisdom is that sports-mad Australians will now focus more on the political contest. Neither side managed to gain a decisive lead with big-spending pledges at their official launches last week and the party leaders returned to their central campaign themes Sunday. Howard said interest rates would rise under the opposition Labor Party and emphasised his conservative Liberal-National coalition's record of more than eight years of economic growth. Latham attacked Howard's credibility on issues such as Australia's involvement in the Iraq war and stressed the prospect of a generational change in leadership under his party. The Labor leader maintained his emphasis on healthcare, with a 665 million Australian dollar (465.5 million US) package to cut the cost of subsidised medicines which he said would be paid for by savings initiatives. Both parties are expected to outline policies to stop logging of iconic old-growth forests in the island state of Tasmania this week, in a bid to capture green support which could form up to 10 percent of the vote. The Sun-Herald's Taverner poll of 800 voters in four marginal seats found 26 percent of respondents felt health was the most important issue of the election, followed by economic management on 15 percent. Only three percent of those polled ranked Australia's involvement in Iraq as the issue that would have the greatest impact on their vote. The Sunday Telegraph poll involved 1,600 voters in 12 marginal seats. Both surveys were conducted after the government and opposition announced their spending pledges last week. They did not give a margin of error.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[YANGON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Focus Energy plans to spend a further four million dollars on its oil operations in Myanmar, where the private firm is already one of the largest onshore producers, the Myanmar Times said. The company will spend the money drilling new wells in the country's north, according to the edition of the semi-official weekly to be published Monday. "Now we are drilling two development wells and at the end of the year we expect to drill another nine wells, mostly development wells," Focus CEO Maurie Drew told the weekly. Drew said that of the 1,000 oil wells the firm had taken over from the state-run Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise at Htaukshabin and Kanni oilfields, only 300 were producing oil. But he said production at those sites was increasing and many old wells were being repaired in preparation to being reactivated. "Now we are producing about 2,500 (barrels per day) and we have a plan to increase production, we produce a little bit more every month." Focus is a privately-owned energy company registered in the British Virgin Islands, while the major shareholders are based in Switzerland. It began operations in Myanmar in 1997 and is responsible for about 15 per cent of total onshore oil production in the military-ruled country. Myanmar has signed dozens of oil and gas exploration and production contracts with foreign firms. The cash-strapped nation last month signaled plans to increase its total oil production by 67 percent this year to reduce costly petrol and diesel imports.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Turkey's Erdogan keeps doubts alive by Sibel Utku Bila.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ANKARA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A true pro-EU campaigner, a cunning Islamist or simply a skillful pragmatist. After a year-and-a-half in office, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan still keeps observers guessing on where his heart really lies. Until only a month ago, the charismatic Erdogan, 50, was the man who led Turkey through a reform process so dramatic that the metamorphosis he claimed to have undergone from Islamist hardliner to conservative democrat seemed credible to many. Then, out of the blue, Erdogan unveiled his intention to make adultery a jailable offense, a move in which critics saw the undertones of Islamic law. His advocacy of the plan was belligerent: he warned the outraged EU not to meddle in Turkey's domestic affairs, called women protesting against the clause "marginals" and suspended a penal code reform crucial to Turkey's EU bid. Only one week later, he was in Brussels, shaking hands with EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen: Turkey's membership bid was back on track; the adultery plan was history. Questions popped up, however: Had Erdogan really changed. Was he only a practicing Muslim, as he said, or a master of political "takiye," the principle of allowing followers of Islam to conceal their faith when in danger. "He may still be regarded as a reformist on other issues, but he proved to be at least very conservative, very traditionalist on social issues concerning the family and women. Certainly his image has changed, and not for the better," a European diplomat observed. Others say the Turkish prime minister has simply too many balls to juggle. He is no longer the man who, as Istanbul mayor back in the 1990s, banned alcohol in municipality-run cafes, they argue, but still has to make hardline Islamists, who form part of the grassroots of his Justice and Development Party (AKP), happy. For them, Erdogan has so far delivered almost nothing -- a ban on headscarves in universities is intact and graduates of religious high schools are barred from higher education establishments other than those teaching theology. Each time he attempted to move on those issues, the army-backed secularist establishment called the prime minister back to order. And that is the juncture where the goals of Erdogan and his supporters are said to intersect with the creeds of the EU: the army should stay out of politics and religious freedoms should be guaranteed. "The Islamists in Turkey have come to see the EU as an island of salvation after the political pressures they were subject to," said Fehmi Calmuk, an Erdogan biographer. He was referring to the turbulent events of 1997, when the army ousted the country's first Islamist prime minister and Erdogan's mentor, Necmettin Erbakan, and launched a harsh anti-Islamist campaign. Erdogan was jailed for four months for reciting a poem with an Islamic message, which the courts saw as an attempt at sedition. The la is a consensus in the AKP on starting negotiations, but this consensus includes different groups with different motivations for turning to Europe," the diplomat said. "If the talks start, we will see whether they are all serious about membership."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JERUSALEM, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed Sunday to press ahead with a massive incursion in the Gaza Strip that has killed almost 60 people in five days. "The operation is progressing in a satisfactory way. Our forces are acting professionally and efficiently. This is not a short operation. We should act for as long as the danger exists," he told Israeli military radio. Sharon said he had "given the order to change the situation on the Gaza front, to hit at the terrorists, their leadership and those who send them, along with those responsible for making weapons". A total of 59 people have been killed since late Tuesday when the army launched its "Days of Penitence" operation -- one of the deadliest since the start of the Palestinian uprising four years ago -- in a bid to prevent rocket attacks by militants. Overnight, three Palestinians militants were killed by Israeli fire in the Jabaliya area of the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian security and hospital sources said, after 11 people were killed on Saturday. The latest casualties were said to be members of the Al-Quds Brigades, an armed faction of the Islamic Jihad movement. "We must broaden the area of action in order to push back the rocket launchers so that Jewish areas along the border are no longer within their range," Sharon said. He said the operation aims to halt rocket fire against Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, both in the immediate term and during implementation of his so-called disengagement plan, which would see all Jewish settlers and troops evacuated from the Strip by the end of 2005. The operation was intensified Wednesday after one rockets killed two young children in the southern Israeli town of Sderot, which lies less than a kilometre (half a mile) from the Gaza border. The Palestinian cabinet on Saturday declared a state of emergency in the occupied territories, with Yasser Arafat appealing for international help against the Israeli incursion. Arafat called on the world to end the "criminal and racist" Israeli campaign, while shops closed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday in a widely followed strike to protest at the deaths of the Palestinians. Egypt and France joined mounting calls for a halt to the violence while Spain, Switzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Canada also expressed concern and the Arab League said it would hold an emergency session on Sunday. And Israel's archfoe Iran accused the Jewish state on Sunday of committing "genocide" against the Palestinians. Militants of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said they would continue to fire the rockets and would target the Israeli port city of Ashkelon. "The Israeli military operation has failed," a leader t Wednesday. "These rockets the Israelis are talking about have not killed anyone. and only make noise," he said. A Palestinian cabinet statement called for international intervention, humanitarian help for the people of Gaza and denounced what it called "world silence in the face of the magnitude of crimes committed". The ongoing violence in northern Gaza raised to 4,415 the overall death toll since the outbreak of the intifada or uprising against Israeli occupation in September 2000, including 3,391 Palestinians and 953 Israelis.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Two people were killed and 10 woundedafter US warplanes bombed a building on the outskirts of the rebel-held Iraqi town of Fallujah on Sunday, medics said. The US military said the raids had probably killed a "large number" of insurgents who had been shifting weapons. "We have received two dead and 10 wounded," said Dr Dhiya Ahmed at the general hospital in Fallujah, west of Baghdad. The strike, the third in just over 24 hours, severely damaged the targeted building, triggering a wave of secondary explosions that indicated ammunition had been stored inside, the army said in a statement. "A large number of enemy fighters are presumed killed," it said. According to the military, 10 to 15 rebels suspected of links with Iraq's most wanted man Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi had been present when it struck at about 1:00 am (2200 GMT Saturday), but it gave no exact casualty figure. The latest onslaught followed two earlier missions around the insurgent-held city targeting suspected Zarqawi hideouts. A building on the outskirts of Fallujah housing another 15 to 20 rebels who the army said had been conducting military-style training was the scene of one bombing on Saturday evening, while another site was hit late on Friday night. In the latest attack, the US military insisted that special measures were taken to ensure no innocent civilians were caught up in the blasts. "All precautions were made to keep collateral damage to a minimum," it said. The US military calls it strikes on Fallujah "precise," while Iraqi hospital officials in the city insist civilians are almost always among casualties.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indonesia on Sunday was awaiting news of two women held hostage in Iraq by kidnappers demanding the release of a jailed extremist cleric after the president of the world's largest Muslim-populated nation appealed for their freedom. President Megawati Sukarnoputri appeared on Arab television calling for the women's release as officials in Jakarta said they were seeking ways to contact the abductors and trying to find the captives' relatives. A group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq said it seized the women. It demanded that Jakarta release Abu Bakar Bashir, an Indonesian cleric whom police say led the Jemaah Islamiyah group, which is believed to have links to Al-Qaeda. In a recording made from his prison cell in Indonesia, Bashir condemned the kidnappers and called for the women to be freed. Ferry Adamhar, Indonesian foreign ministry director for citizens' protection, told AFP that Jakarta's mission in Doha was attempting to make contact with the kidnappers. A written statement sent by the abductors to the Al-Jazeera television network named the two hostages as Rosidah binti Anom and Rafikah binti Aming. However Indonesian authorities have yet to locate their relatives. "Until now, we do not yet have the precise identity of the two. Nobody has come up so far to say they know any of the two women," said Adamhar. Adamhar, who is leading a team to help secure the women's release, said officials were combing districts on Java island where the hostages are believed to be from in the hope of finding relatives to make further appeals. The two women, reportedly seized alongside six Iraqis and two Lebanese all working for electronics company G-Bell, were pictured in Islamic headscarves in footage shot by their captors and aired on Al-Jazeera on Friday. On Saturday the Arab news channel broadcast an appeal by Megawati for their release. The Indonesian president, whose country staunchly opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq, said there was no political reason for the kidnapping. "I sincerely ask in my own name, in the name of the state, in the name of the Indonesian government, that they be immediately freed from the hands of the hostage-takers so they can go home again to their families," she said. Lawyers for Bashir, who is in jail awaiting trial on terrorism charges, told AFP that the cleric also rejected the abductor's demands. They said he would refuse to be released in return for the women's freedom. "My release should be made through legal channels, even though the Indonesian justice is until today still dominated by, and working for, foreign interests," lawyer Mahendradatta quoted Bashir as having said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[COLOMBO, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Sri Lanka's latest bid to revive the peace process with Tiger rebels has suffered a stillbirth with the country's main opposition calling for a boycott of the new initiative, political sources said Sunday. President Chandrika Kumaratunga is due to launch a "National Advisory Council for Peace and Reconciliation" on Monday. But parties holding the balance of power in parliament, who can make or break a deal with rebels, will not attend. "The council shall be the forum for consultation and advice on issues pertaining to the peace process and for advancing reconciliation and understanding among persons of communities through dialogue," the president's office said. The main opposition United National Party (UNP) dismissed Kumaratunga's initiative and said the way to end the deadlock in the Norwegian-backed peace process was to start direct negotiations with the Tigers. Compounding the problems for Kumaratunga is a decision by Tiger proxies in parliament, the Tamil National Alliance, to keep away and instead insist on resuming peace talks based on the controversial Tiger self-rule proposals. Political sources said the council would be of little use without the key players. Kumaratunga's Marxist-backed party came to power in April after dismissing the right-wing administration of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe on a charge of making too many concessions to Tigers. Negotiations between Colombo and the Tigers have been suspended since April 2003 when the guerrillas abruptly pulled out. Diplomatic efforts since then to revive the process have been inconclusive. Diplomatic pressure on the parties mounted at the weekend with the US government asking both sides to get back to the negotiating table to resolve a conflict that has claimed over 60,000 lives since 1972. "We urge both parties to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring peace to the island," state department spokesman Richard Boucher said. The State Department praised Kumaratunga for her "flexibility" in attempting to renew the talks and said any further delay in their resumption would hurt the interests of both sides. Boucher also urged the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to immediately end attacks against the government and to stop using children as combatants in their struggle for an independent homeland. "Both sides have to take steps to ensure that all provisions of the Ceasefire Agreement are adhered to," he said in a statement, referring to a February 2002 truce arranged and put in place by peace broker Norway. "President Kumaratunga has shown flexibility in her proposals to renew discussions with the LTTE," Boucher said. "Further delay in restarting negotiations can only damage the interests of all Sri Lankans who stand to gain from a return to real peace." Inside the country, the main opposition led by Wickremesinghe waspposition for such a majority.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KHARTOUM, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Ethnic minority rebels in Darfur have rejected an attempt by the Sudanese government to divide them ahead of a new round of peace talks in Nigeria later this month, a Khartoum daily reported Sunday. The Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) said it would not take part in the talks in Abuja on October 21 unless fellow rebels from the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) were also allowed to take part. Khartoum "has no right to name which of the opposition movements can take part in the talks but can name its own delegation," SLM spokesman Mahjoub Hussein told the Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper from his base in London. The Sudanese government has accused the JEM of complicity in an alleged coup attempt in Khartoum last month by the Popular Congress party of jailed Islamist opposition leader Hassan al-Turabi and rejected it as a negotiating partner. But the rebels, along with nearly all the other myriad armed groups opposed to the military-backed regime in Khartoum, charge that the alleged coup bid never took place and was a mere ploy by the government to divert attention from its mounting diplomatic woes. The SLM spokesman expressed concern that Khartoum was set to retain its hardline pointman on Darfur -- Agriculture Minister Majzoub al-Khalifa Ahmed -- for the next round of negotiations for an end to the 20-month conflict in the vast western region. The current team "lacked the political vision needed for the negotiations," Hussein said. The agriculture minister has been outspoken in rejecting mounting international pressure for a genuinely federal system to address the grievances of Sudan's non-Arab minorities in the north as well as the south. On Thursday he was quoted as saying that Khartoum "does not speak at the moment about autonomy to any region in the north," sharply backtracking on pledges by other government ministers that self-rule for Darfur's indigenous minorities was on the table. As many as 50,000 people have died and 1.4 million fled their homes since Khartoum launched its bloody clampdown on the rebels and minority civilians suspected of supporting them, according to UN figures. Despite two UN Security Council resolutions and an agreement with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Khartoum has yet to meet demands to stem what the United Nations describes as the world's worst current humanitarian crisis.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISTANBUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Andrea is a "Rum", Tarin is Armenian, Giovanni a Levantine. For centuries, their communities served as bridges between Europe and the Ottoman Empire whose successor, Turkey, is now seeking full membership in the European Union. All three are Christian and favor the mainly Muslim country's entry into the EU and see in it a fragile hope for their disappearing cultures. Andrea Rombopoulos single-handedly produces Iho, one of two Greek-language dailies to still appear in Turkey. He claims 80 percent of Istanbul's "Rums" -- Romans, as Greeks of Turkish nationality are called here, in reference to the Eastern Roman Empire from which they descended -- read his paper. That makes about 1,600 people. Rombopoulos believes Turkey's membership in the European bloc will end all the problems his community faces in trying to defend its rights. "We have about 60 foundations that run our schools and our churches," he explained. "But for the past 37 years, the (Turkish) state has forbidden any elections to renew their management -- has sometimes seized their property -- and prevented them from functioning properly." Turkish membership in the EU, he believes, will be the best guarantee for the future of his dwindling community. In the editorial offices of his newspaper, in a 19th century townhouse built by the great Zarifi "Rum" banking dynasty that is witness to the past grandeur and current decline of Istanbul's Greeks, Rombopoulos laments: "We are on the verge of extinction." The EU, he explained, can mean salvation. "When Turkey enters the EU, foreign firms will invest in Turkey and they will need staff who know how to trade with the Turks," he said. "The Greeks are in the best position to do that. "If new (Greek) families settle in Istanbul, then maybe we can save our culture." Tarin Karakasli, who works for the Armenian daily Agos, agrees. "Turkey joining the EU means normalizing relations with Armenia," she said. "For people like us, who live in the shadow of their ancestors, this will be like a drop of cool water through a parched throat. we could even speak of a cultural renaissance." She is a fervent supporter of Turkey's rapid accession to the European bloc -- contrary to most of the Armenian diaspora, which says Turkey should be kept out of the EU until it admits that the 1915 massacre of hundreds of thousand of Armenians was an act of genocide. "My newspaper believes that only a fully democratic country can question its past," she said. "As things stand, Turkey can neither confirm nor deny something it does not really know about -- something that has been kept under wraps like a terrible taboo." She believes that the democratization process accompanying membership talks will free the Turkish mindset -- and allow the country's 45,000-strong Armenian community to finallysh of Levantines into Turkey -- I don't think so. "Anyway," he joked, "once Turkey is part of the EU, at least I won't have to queue for my residence permit every five years."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Pakistan police probing identity of Shiite mosque bombing suspect.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ISLAMABAD, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Pakistani security agencies are trying to identify a charred body believed to be that of the bomber who blew himself up in a crowded Shiite Muslim mosque and killed 30 people, police said Sunday. "We have recovered a badly mutilated and charred body of a man, we suspect he was the man who detonated the bomb inside the mosque," senior police officer Ishtiaq Hussain Shah told AFP. "He was a young man, about 25 years of age," Shah said. "So far no one has come to claim the body and witnesses believe he was the man who had come to the mosque with a briefcase which might have carried the explosive device," the police officer said. "Police and other security agencies are trying to identify the body." The bomb went off during Friday noon prayers in the city of Sialkot when hundreds of worshippers from the minority Shiite sect had packed the mosque. The blast killed at least 30 people and dozens were injured, 12 of them seriously. Thousands of people attended special prayers for the victims on Sunday. Speakers -- including the Imam of the mosque, Faiz Ali Kirpalvi, who was himself injured -- condemned the attack and demanded the immediate arrest of the attackers. Sialkot was plunged into mourning after the bombing, termed by the authorities an act of terrorism. Shops and markets near the Shiite Zainabia Mosque remained closed after community leaders called for a two-day shutdown. Tensions remained high on Sunday and groups of people continued to gather outside the scene of the bombing but no incidents were reported. Rioting erupted after funeral prayers on Saturday. Hundreds of angry youths carrying bamboo sticks attacked a police station, public buildings and state-run banks and torched about a dozen vehicles. "Police and paramilitary troops are patrolling the city but the situation is under control," said city mayor Javed Naeem. The administration has set up peace committees and Shiite leaders have appealed to people not to indulge in violence, he said. Local Shiite leader Pervez Mehndi said the authorities Sunday released about a dozen Shiite youths who were detained for rioting on Saturday. Provincial Law Minister Muhammad Bisharat Raja announced a 10 million rupee (170,000 dollar) reward for information about the culprits. The attack came five days after Pakistani security forces killed the country's most wanted Sunni Muslim extremist, Al-Qaeda operative Amjad Farooqi, in a shootout in the south of the country. Farooqi, the alleged mastermind of several attempts to kill President Pervez Musharraf, was an activist in the Harkatul Jihad-e-Islam, a Sunni Muslim group blamed for the 2002 murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl. Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao said Saturday the blast could be a reaction to the killing of Amjad Farooqi, who he said had been involved in sectarian crimes. Fanatics from Pakistan's Sunni Muslim majority and Shiite minority have been killing each other since the 1980s. The conflict has so far cost more than 4,000 lives.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Three Palestinian militants were killed by Israeli fire in the Jabaliya refugee camp early Sunday as troops continued a massive operation in the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian security sources said. One Palestinian was killed when an Israeli tank shell struck him near a school in the camp, they said. His identity was not immediately clear, but witnesses said he belonged to the Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the radical Islamic Jihad movement. An army spokeswoman said troops had opened fire towards the man as he was preparing to launch a missile towards them. "He was part of a group of several men who were about to launch an anti-tank missile," she told AFP, saying troops had registered a "hit". Shortly before dawn, another two activists from the Al Quds Brigades were killed by an Israeli rocket fired in the camp, Palestinian medical and security sources said. The spokeswoman said soldiers had spotted a group of gunmen trying to booby-trap a road in the camp. "Two terrorists from Islamic Jihad were seen trying to plant an explosive device. The force opened fire and killed them," she said. The latest deaths brought to 62 the number of people killed since the start of a massive Israeli operation in the northern Gaza Strip late Tuesday, including 59 Palestinians and three Israelis, two of them soldiers. It also raised to 4,415 the overall death toll since the outbreak of the intifada or uprising against Israeli occupation in September 2000, including 3,391 Palestinians and 953 Israelis.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TEHRAN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Iran announced Sunday it intended to take part in a US-proposed international conference on election plans for Iraq scheduled to take place in Egypt next month. "In principle, taking part in the conference does not pose a problem for us," foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters, adding the Islamic republic "welcomes all initiatives that favour stability in Iraq." "The details on our participation will be announced later," he added. US Secretary of State Colin Powell unveiled plans for the conference last week amid mounting expressions of skepticism among world leaders that the security situation in Iraq would permit nationwide elections to go ahead as promised by the end of January. Egypt's foreign ministry announced Saturday it will host the international conference during the last week of November, and Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit said it appeared that all of the parties invited to attend would do so. The United States and the Iraqi interim government are hoping the meeting will bring Iraq's neighbours on board in efforts to help stabilise the country, which remains wracked by violence. Iran and Syria in particular are accused of supporting insurgents battling the US-led occupation of the country, although both have denied frequent charges of meddling. In proposing the conference, Powell said he had no objection to the presence of Iran. The two countries cut off diplomatic relations in 1980, but Iran recently resumed full diplomatic ties with Iraq, with whom ties were cut at the outset of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Taiwan on Sunday announced support for Japan's application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, officials said. "Regarding the UN reform, we supported Japan to play a critical role," Chiou I-jen, head of the National Security Council, was quoted by the United Evening News as saying while attending a Taiwan-Japan forum. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi last week pitched his country's bid at the UN General Assembly, saying it should be a reward for its contributions to global peace and security. Japan, along with Germany, Brazil and India, have launched a united campaign to be admitted to the Security Council on a permanent basis. Taiwan's rival China was reluctant to back Japan. Beijing has long said Japan should not be admitted because it has not yet adequately faced up to the atrocities it committed in China before and during World War II. Chiou urged the world to set aside history. He said Japan, as the biggest democracy in East Asia, deserves the seat. Tokyo recognizes Beijing but maintains close economic links with Taipei, which lost its UN seat to China in 1971.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[More than a million people thronged central Paris for an all-night cultural festival that finished in the early hours of Sunday and which saw city spots turned into stages for music, cinema and experimental art. The capital's mayor, Bertrand Delanoe, opened the annual event -- called "Nuit Blanche" (literally, "White Night", meaning a sleepless night in French) -- by dedicating it to celebrated French writer Francoise Sagan, who died last month. The municipality's cultural official, Christophe Girard, hailed the "peaceful and good-natured" behaviour of the crowds who spilled off the sidewalks as they walked around the 125 venues showcasing the works of 300 artists from around the world. Delanoe's council started the idea three years ago as a way of livening up Paris for residents and tourists alike, along with a summer initiative of installing a temporary artificial beach and altering roads to be more bicycle-friendly. The inaugural festival in 2002 was marred when a man professing a hatred for homosexuals stabbed Delanoe, who is openly gay, in the stomach. Police said 2004's version went off without incident. One of the biggest draws was an old-fashioned ball under artificial snow and blue lanterns in the central Les Halles district attended by 15,000 people. Other events included a choral concert at Notre Dame Cathedral and an inflatable cinema screen showing Buster Keaton classics outside a former stockmarket building. Also, three swimming pools stayed open all night, as did the underground Metro rail system, and 8,000 roller-bladers took to the streets in a fast-moving procession. Among those enjoying the special night were a group of 15 children suffering from a rare disease which leaves them intolerant to unltra-violet light, and therefore to daylight. They came from all over the country to enjoy a rare chance to mingle socially with other youngsters, with a doctor in attendance to check the UV levels at each event as they toured the capital. Along with the homage to Sagan, the night was dedicated to two French hostages being held in Iraq -- journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot -- with the lobby group Reporters Without Borders setting up a van outside the mayoral building to collect signatures in support of their release.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Argentina's Guillermo Canas crushed unheralded German Lars Burgsmuller in the final of the Shanghai ATP tennis tournament on Sunday, conceding just one game in the process. Third seed Canas outclassed his 123rd ranked opponent 6-1, 6-0 in an outstanding display of speed and power to come out on top in the 380,500 dollar event. An aggressive Burgsmuller tried to take the game to Canas, attacking from all angles, but the quicker and determined Buenos Aires native always had an answer as he outran and outgunned the 28-year-old German. Canas, 26, set the tone of the match early as he broke Burgsmuller in the third game of the first set. It heralded what was to come as the unseeded Mulheim resident succumbed in the fifth game and again in the seventh. A change of shirt from white to black did little to change Burgsmuller's fortunes in the second set. He continued to struggle to hit the mark with his first serve, while also faltering on key points that could have kept him apace of his opponent. For Canas, who is set to move up in the world rankings from his current 24th, it was his third title of the year and a vindication for missing most of 2003 recuperating from surgery on his wrist. With his sixth career ATP title in the bag, following back-to-back tournaments at Umag and Stuttgart in July, Canas has no doubts about where he wants to go. "My next goal is to try and get into the top 10," said Canas. Canas has now won 18 of his last 19 matches, with his only loss coming at the hands of 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Opener Brendon Taylor and Dion Ebrahim hit half-centuries to lift Zimbabwe in the second tri-series match against Pakistan here on Sunday. Taylor hit an attractive 73 while Ebrahim finished with a resolute 71 not out to help the tourists reach 252-4 in the allotted 50 overs after Pakistan's stand-in captain Yousuf Youhana put them in. The 18-year-old Taylor, who hit his maiden first class hundred in a four-day match last week, hit six boundaries at the top of the order. Ebrahim steadied the innings, hitting only four boundaries. Skipper Tatenda Taibu played a brisk knock of 46 not out off just 33 deliveries. He hit three towering sixes and a boundary to finish Zimbabwe's innings on a high note and improve on their paltry 148 in the first match. Pakistan, who won the first match at Multan by 144 runs last week, rested express paceman Shoaib Akhtar and Abdul Razzaq while captain Inzamam-ul Haq (groin injury) and Moin Khan (flu) missed the match. Sri Lanka, the third team in the tri-series, face Pakistan in the third match in Karachi on Wednesday. Zimbabwe were given a sound start of 87 by Stuart Matsikenyeri and Taylor, who batted with resolve and treated a weakened Pakistan attack with disdain. Leg-spinner Shahid Afridi got the first breakthrough for the home team when Matsikenyeri hit his looping delivery straight to long on for Mohammad Sami to take an easy catch. Matsikenyeri made 41. Taylor, who reached his fifty off 87 balls, found an able ally in Dion Ebrahim. The pair added 72 for the third wicket before paceman Rana Naveedul Hassan pegged them back with a double strike. Naveed induced Taylor to miscue a drive for Youhana to catch him at mid-off and then bowled Mark Vermeulen for one to leave Zimbabwe 161-4 off 40 overs. Ebrahim reached his half-century off 72 balls with a solitary boundary but saw his captain Taibu took charge with lusty hitting, giving his team 91 runs for the fifth wicket stand in the last ten overs. Naveed was the pick of the bowlers with two wickets but his ten overs cost 82 runs.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Iran said Sunday it was unable to confirm reports that Israeli agents have been operating in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, but nevertheless warned Iraqi officials to "pay attention". "Regarding the presence of Israeli forces in northen Iraq, we have also heard some things," foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters. "We hope this news is a lie and that Iraqi officials pay attention to the sensitivites of neighbouring countries," he warned, adding the matter was the subject of "protests" by several states on the sidelines of an Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) gathering in Turkey. Although he said "our proof is only based on reports", he warned that any Israeli presence in northern Iraq "is not something that the Islamic and regional nations would accept, because Israel is an enemy of the region." Speculation that Israeli agents have been operating in Iraq's Kurdish areas has been circulating for several months. On Saturday a leading Egyptian MP charged that Israel had taken advantage of last year's US-led invasion of Iraq to deploy large numbers of it agents there to spy on neighbouring Iran and Syria. "They can deny it all they like but it's the reality," said Mustafa Feki, the chairman of the Egyptian parliamentary foreign affairs committee and a leading member of the ruling National Democratic Party of President Hosni Mubarak.]]></c>

"We have to understand that regardless of our successes (on the path towards NATO membership) we will not enter the alliance until (Ante) Gotovina's case is solved," Anton Tus told the Jutarnji List daily. "Gotovina himself should be aware of that." Gotovina has been charged by the UN court in The Hague for crimes against ethnic Serbs during a key 1995 military operation he led on territories held by rebel Serbs. The operation virtually ended Croatia's 1991-95 war of independece from the former Yugoslavia, opposed by Belgrade-backed rebel Serbs. Gotovina went into hiding in mid-2001 immediately after the UN tribunal charged him. The European Union has been putting pressure on Croatia to arrest Gotovina but Zagreb maintains that the 49-year-old has fled the country. Croatia is hoping to become a full-fledged member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by 2007. The Balkans country also wants to meet criteria for EU membership by that date. Last week Croatian police questionned four people suspected of being Gotovina's supporters and raided their houses and offices.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will discuss Manila's efforts to make peace with Muslim separatist rebels when he meets Philippine President Gloria Arroyo this week, her spokesman said Sunday. Mahathir will meet Arroyo for dinner on Monday before his speech to the Philippine Business Conference on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo said. Arroyo will likely thank Mahathir for his role when he was in power in fostering the resumption of peace talks between the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Romulo said Mahathir, who is credited with developing Malaysia's economy, would also discuss the Philippines' efforts to avoid a looming fiscal crisis. "The president said she would welcome any advice that Dr. Mahathir may wish to give," he added. Malaysia has hosted the resumption of peace talks between the government and the MILF and is leading a mission from Muslim countries, to monitor a ceasefire in place between the two sides in the strife-torn southern Philippines. The 12,000-strong MILF has been fighting to set up a separate Islamic state in the southern third of this largely-Christian archipelago. However the rebels signed a truce with Manila two years ago and denounced foreign terrorist links, paving the way for the reopening of peace negotiations. There have been allegations by security officials that the MILF is still sheltering members of the Jemaah Islamiyah regional terror network in its camps in the south. MILF leaders deny this. Officials also said Arroyo would thank several leaders of Southeast Asian and European nations for supporting the peace process with the MILF when she attends the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Hanoi from October 7 to 9. "With the arrival of the international peace monitors and sustained cessation of hostilities between the MILF and our military, the president can inform world leaders present at the ASEM summit that the. peace agenda is now at an advanced stage," said Arroyo spokesman Ignacio Bunye.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Nigerian league champions Dolphin of Port Harcourt completed a league and cup double when they defeated Enugu Rangers 1-0 in the final of the FA Cup Saturday. Dolphin's remarkable double victory comes nine years after Shooting Stars of Ibadan last achieved such a feat on the local scene. The double kings deservedly went ahead in the 44th minute when Bola Bello slotted a through ball beyond onrushing Rangers goalkeeper Sam Okoye. Playing in front of an impressive crowd at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, both teams went in search of a goal from kick-off with Rangers first to find their rhythm. However, it was Dolphin who created the best chances of the first half. On 40 minutes, striker Kelechi Osunwa failed to get a foot to a cross after a mazy dribbling run by Ochuko Ojobo from the rightwing. And almost immediately defender Emma Godwin's header off a corner kick missed the target. After the interval, Rangers adopted the long ball tactic and this unsettled their opponents, causing a few anxious moments in the Dolphin defence as towering substitute Ugochukwu Okeke won virtually everything in the air. "We were unlucky especially in the second half where we played very well and deserved at least a goal," said Rangers coach Lawrence Akpokona, who was also critical of the officiating. Dolphin, who first won the cup competition in 2001, also won a cash prize of three million naira and each player has been promised a car by Rivers State Government, financiers of the club. A 37th minute goal by Ebeki Johnbull earned Insurance of Benin third place in the cup competition ahead of Julius Berger.]]></c>

The hospital corridor smelled of decomposing bodies as staff wearing surgical masks lifted corpses out of the building one after the other, shouting out names as they reached the front doors. "Ali Salman Othman Majid, 20," yelled one hospital employee as another scribbled down the details on a notepad. A grey-haired man gripped a white handkerchief as he watched his lifeless son being loaded on to a white pick-up truck piled with five other body bags. His wife and five other women wept as they crammed into the back of his car with four children on their lap. Two days ago, US and Iraqi forces launched one of the largest post-Saddam Hussein military operations in a first major push to reconquer the country's insurgent enclaves ahead of planned approached the heavily-guarded premises to claim the bodies of his sister-in-law, five nieces and one nephew he claimed were killed by US fire. "I blame the Americans for all this. They were driving away from the Al-Khatul neighbourhood where there was intense fighting," Hassan Abbas Mahmud sobbed. Moments later, he left with the bodies. Head doctor Abdul Hamid said that all of the hospital's 50-odd corpses would be carried out by noon, some of them wrapped in blankets or black plastic after all the special bags were used up. US troops took pictures of the some of the hospital's 120 wounded as they were being transferred to the nearby city of Tikrit due to a shortage in medecines, doctors and electricity. The head of the city council, Taha Hussein Salah, then arrived on the hospital grounds. Even as he cooperated with the US troops for the evacuation of the bodies, mean glances were exchanged with the colonel. "We did not request from the interior ministry or any other government official for troops to come into the city," he said as Schacht stood nearby, grimacing. Wearing a brown dishdasha (robe) and a traditional headdress, he nevertheless sounded conflicted about the operation and admitted: "The problem is that some people here don't respect anybody, not the sheikhs, not the city council, not the imams." "That's why we're in this situation now," Salah said. "But for every person who died, there will be five to 15 of his relatives who will want to fight back. and in the end it's always the innocent who pay the price."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[China and South Korea are likely to skip Asia's first multinational naval exercise aimed at seizing weapons of mass destruction, a report said Sunday. Japan will this month host the first Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) drill to be held in Asia and has invited the two key neighbours to take part, Tokyo Shimbun newspaper said. Neither China nor South Korea have replied, the daily said. "Both the Chinese and South Korean governments are believed to have decided to forgo the event due to consideration for North Korea," which opposes the exercise, it said, citing government sources. North Korea slammed Japan in August for adopting a "double-faced" attitude towards it by leading the PSI exercise while engaging in talks to improve ties with the communist state. North Korea has previously exported missiles and is working to develop nuclear weapons. Ten previous PSI exercises were held in other parts of the world. The upcoming drill off Tokyo Bay will draw participants from 15 core PSI member nations, including Australia, Britain, France, Singapore and the United States. China and South Korea are not members. The PSI allows for the seizure of missiles and other potential components of weapons of mass destruction while they are being transferred at sea or in the air. In August the then-defence agency chief Shigeru Ishiba said Japan hoped many Asian nations would take part in the drill. No comment on the report was available from the agency on Sunday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SUKHUMI, Georgia, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia voted for its first new leader in 10 years Sunday, in an election taking place amid simmering tension between the separatist regime here and Georgia's government. The tough-talking new Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has vowed to restore central rule over Abkhazia, but many fear he could be on a collision course with Abkhazia's rulers -- and with neighbouring Russia, which backs the separatist regime. The man widely seen as favourite to win Sunday's vote was 46-year-old Raul Khajimba, currently Abkhazia's prime minister. He is seen as a pro-Russian who will fiercely defend his region's autonomy. "We were in Georgia once and we do not want to go back to that," Khajimba said as he cast his ballot at school No.4 in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi. "Whoever wins the election, Abkhazia's path will be that of an independent state. Our policy of moving closer to Russia will (also) stay the same." In the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, there was condemnation of the elections. "Of course we, along with the whole of the international community, do not recognise the legitimacy of these elections," Georgia's Security Minister Vano Merabishvili said late Saturday. But he added: "We do not intend to interfere in any way, unless pressure is put on (ethnic Georgians living in Abkhazia). We are absolutely ready to defend our citizens if need be." Sunday's poll was the first properly contested leadership election held in Abkhazia since it shook off Tbilisi's rule in a war in the early 1990s. That conflict left some 10,000 people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands of refugees, the majority of them ethnic Georgians who fled Abkhazia. There are fears that the three-way spat between Tbilisi, Moscow and Sukhumi could again erupt into violence, destabilizing a Caucasus region which is soon to be a strategic gateway for oil exports from the Capsian Sea to Western markets. The row over Abkhazia's status was rekindled after Saakashvili, a US-educated lawyer, was swept to power in Georgia last year in a dramatic bloodless revolution. He has said he will not rest until Georgia's separatist regions -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- are back under Tbilisi's control. This summer he announced Georgian warships would sink any vessels carrying tourists from Russia to resorts in Abkhazia, provoking a furious response from Moscow. Sunday's vote was called to choose a replacement for Vladislav Ardzinba, the man who led Abkhazia's war of secession but who for the last several years has been incapactiated by serious illness. A field of five candidates is competing but only two, Khajimba and businessman Sergei Bagpash, have a realistic chance of winning, according to observers. Khajimba got a vital boost when Russia's President Vla It had been feared that the ethnic Georgians might clash with the separatist authorities over the election.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GAZA CITY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Palestinian minister lashed out at the international community Sunday for staying silent over Israel's deadly incursion into the Gaza Strip, saying it was only encouraging a continuation of the vast operation. "The absence of international reaction is encouraging (Israeli Prime Minister) Ariel Sharon to assert that the operation will continue, although the situation is getting worse and the Palestinian people are enduring massacres," Palestinian negotiations minister Saeb Erakat told AFP. Erakat was speaking shortly before an emergency session of the Palestinian parliament to discuss the situation in the northern Gaza Strip, where almost 60 Palestinians have been killed during the five day Israali operation. Members of the Palestinian Legislative Council were set to meet in the West Bank city of Ramallah to discuss ways of defusing the crisis, deputy speaker Hassan Khreishe told AFP. "Sharon's objective is to destroy the Palestinian Authority and the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation), and to reoccupy the Gaza Strip in order to turn it into one vast prison," Erakat said, warning that the raid would lead to "a flareup in violence and extremism". Resolution of the Palestinian question was unlikely in the wake of Israel's "state terrorism" in Gaza, he added. Until now, nearly all of the 62 people killed since the start of Israel's massive operation in northern Gaza late Tuesday have been Palestinians. Three of the victims were Israeli, two of whom were soldiers. Erakat's comments were made shortly after Sharon confirmed that the operation, aimed at stopping the flow of Palestinian rockets fired at Israel, would continue. "This is not a short operation. We should act for as long as the danger exists," Sharon told Israel military radio. Over the weekend, Egypt and France joined the growing chorus of international condemnation of the raid, which Spain, Switzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Canada also expressing concern at the scope of the Israeli operation. The Arab League, which is to hold an emergency session over the crisis on Sunday, also criticised the Middle East Quartet, comprising diplomats from the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia, for not speaking out against the ongoing raid. So far, the United States has refrained from criticising Israel, saying only that the Jewish state should use "proportional force" and to avoid civilian Palestinian casualties.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Visionary spacecraft designer is a legend in his field by Jean-Louis Santini.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Burt Rutan, creator of the first privately-owned manned spaceship, is a dentist's son who tested model airplanes from the window of his mother's car as a child. Rutan's brainchild SpaceShipOne is set to blast off for a final test flight Monday, aiming to puncture the 100-kilometer (62-mile) high edge of earth's atmosphere and the paradigm of space as a sphere beyond most mortals' reach. If it does, it will win the coveted 10-million-dollar Ansari X Prize meant to foment a new era of private space travel, just 80 years after the dawn of commercial air transport. If it does not, Rutan, 61, will still be a legend of aircraft and aerospace design. The founder and CEO of Scaled Composites, the world's most productive aerospace development company, Rutan has helped conceive, develop and test numerous aircraft for the Pentagon and the US space agency NASA. Rutan is known for using composite materials that due to their lightness, flexibility and resilience have pushed the envelope of aircraft design. A civilian test pilot for the US Air Force during his youth, from 1965 to 1972, Rutan later conceived and created Voyager, the first plane to fly around the world without stopping and without refueling. The vessel with its outsized wings is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington. The plane took off from Edwards Air Base on December 14, 1986, piloted by his older brother Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, and returned nine days later, having flown a 40,000 kilometer (24,855 mile) loop around the world. Rutan is also known as a designer of small aircrafts for personal use, available to amateurs to build in their garages. His designs such as the VariEze et the LongEz use an old-fashioned tail-less "duck" design that gives the craft great stability. Rutan is the type of person who lives his passions fully and openly. In audiocassettes he sent to his family while testing airplanes for the US Air Force in California, during his twenties, Rutan told of his dream of making a difference in the world of aviation. That drive cost him his first marriage. He admitted as much in a recent interview with the New Yorker magazine, joking that it was an easy choice between the airplane he was building and his wife. In the late 1990s he turned seriously to the holy grail of aeronautics, a high-altitude research rocket capable of flying to 100 kilometers (62 miles) of altitude. His new wife Tonya, more than twenty years his junior, tells of how her husband woke her at three in the morning to tell her excitedly that he had hit upon a concept for the spaceship design -- a badminton shuttlecock. The shuttlecock, a lightweight cone with a rounded rubber nose surrounded by feathers, falls slowly and always in the same position, Rutan explained. Its first flight took place six years later, opening the way for a revolution in private space travel. Elbert Rutan was born June 17, 1943 in Portland, Oregon in the northwestern United States. He grew up in central California, the second of three children of a dentist. As children Rutan and his brother convinced their mother Irene to drive down deserted roads at high speeds late at night so they could test model airplanes by holding them out the car windows. During SpaceShipOne's second test flight Wednesday, the rocket plane's ballast weight was made up by a range of memorabilia proffered by team members, including the ashes of Rutan's late mother. A graduate of California State Polytechnic University, Rutan also did coursework at the California Institute of Technology and at Edwards Air Force Base. He has lived since 1974 in California's Mojave Desert.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A once keenly sought New Zealand export to China is facing its stiffest test as the deer pizzle trade faces growing competition from anti impotency drugs. About 200,000 of the deer penises, complete with testicles, were sold to China each year, but the market was gradually declining, Murray Hamer, Oriental trade manager for the Alpine Deer Group said Sunday. "For a long time men believed that the larger the pizzle, the stronger their own would be," he said. "The belief in the sexual vigour of pizzles is slowly dying out. Modern Chinese men believe they don't work. They have turned to the Chinese version of Viagra and are getting results." The pizzles were generally served in a soup, after being boiled for hours with herbs. Sometimes, a three-pizzle soup was made, from deer, snake and seal pizzles and served in slices. Asked if he had tried pizzle soup, Hamer said, yes "but it was simply awful". Hamer, whose company exports a variety of other deer parts to China, declined to reveal the worth of the market on commercial grounds.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Forensic experts have exhumed the body of a Kenyan girl who died after she was allegedly raped by a British soldier several years ago, police said on Sunday. "We exhumed the remains of the girl on Saturday, took all the samples we wanted, then reburied her remains," said Kenya's Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Deputy Director John Maina. The samples from Mantoi Lekoloi Kaunda's body will be examined by British and Kenyan pathologists as part of a probe into claims that British soldiers raped hundreds of Kenyan women over a 30-year period. A Kenyan court last month ordered the body of the 16-year-old to be exhumed. "The girl's family insisted that Lekoloi and her younger sister were attacked by two soldiers while walking home after collecting firewood some time in 1995," Maina told AFP from Isiolo town in eastern Kenya. Lekoloi's remains were exhumed by 20 forensic experts from Britain and Kenya, he said, in her home near Archer's Post in eastern Kenya, one of the ranges where British soldiers carried out exercises for more than three decades. "Now we have several tests to do, including trying to establish in the laboratory if there is any seminal fluid that can be traced in the samples or the Kikoi (traditional wrap dress) that we also recovered," Maina said. Kaunda Letoo, who said her daughter was six months pregnant when she was raped, witnessed the exhumation, Maina added.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SENAI, Malaysia, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korea claimed a play-off victory Sunday as Kim Dae-sub and Shin Yong-jin led Myanmar and Taiwan to the World Cup in Spain. The 23-year-old Kim, a two-time Korean Open champion, drained a 40-foot birdie putt on the second extra hole at Palm Resort Golf and Country Club to relegate Myanmar duo Kyi Hla Han and Soe Kyaw Naing to the runner-up place after both teams finished tied at the top on 12-under-par 276. South Korea closed with a 72 in the final day's foursomes while Myanmar shot a 75. Taiwan's Lu Wei-chih and Wang Ter-chang endured an anxious finish to claim the last slot to Spain after a 76. They dropped a bogey and double bogey in their last two holes and finished one stroke ahead of surprise package Pakistan, who carded a 70 to earn first reserve status for the World Cup in November. "We never thought of winning as our intention was to finish inside the top three," said Kim, who like Shin earned his first World Cup appearance. "In the second hole of the play-off, I saw the putting line and felt good. I knew I would make the putt." Shin said their game plan was to play it safe as they entered the final round with a four-shot cushion over the fourth placed team. "I guess that was why we played well. Choi Kyung-ju could have earned an automatic place in the World Cup through the world rankings but he declined to play. I guess that gave us the opportunity to qualify and I'm glad we have made it," said Shin, last year's Korean number one. For the 43-year-old Han, it was still mission accomplished although he had two chances to claim victory, first missing a 12-foot birdie putt at the last hole in regulation and then another eight footer in the first play-off hole. "The main goal was to qualify and we felt comfortable the whole day up till the 14th when we double bogeyed.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[VATICAN CITY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified the last Austro-Hungarian emperor, Charles I, and a German mystic whose visions inspired Mel Gibson's controversial film "The Passion of the Christ". The move brings the Habsburg emperor, who is remembered in Austria for authorising the use of mustard gas during World War I, and mystic Anna Katharina Emmerick one step from sainthood. "I hope Emperor Charles will serve as an example, especially for those with political responsibilities in Europe today," the pope said during an open-air ceremony in Saint Peter's Square that was attended by 30,000 worshippers, including around 1,000 members of the Habsburg dynasty. The pope also conferred the status of "blessed", the penultimate step to full sainthood, on two Frenchmen and an Italian nun. Habsburg emperor Charles I became heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian empire on June 28, 1914, following the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, which historians say was the spark that ignited World War I. He was made emperor in November 1916 and crowned apostolic King of Hungary a month later. His official biography, published by the Vatican, says he was committed to peace and was the only political leader to support Pope Benedict XV's peace efforts. But his beatification has caused controversy in Austria, where Charles I is remembered for authorising the use of mustard gas during World War I and where critics believe his elevation to be politically driven by the conservative right. The Austrian press has ridiculed not only the emperor's political record but the miracle he allegedly produced to merit beatification. According to the Vatican, he cured a Brazilian nun of varicose veins after doctors had given up all hope for her. Emmerick was born into a farming community in 1774, joined a convent and became famous for bearing the stigmata -- the wounds to hands and feet suffered by Christ during crucifixion -- after being confined to bed with a long illness. She died at the age of 50. She is revered as a selfless worker in the biography provided by the Vatican, which says "she was always willing to take on hard work and loathsome tasks". The poet Clemens Brentano became an admirer and visited her sick bed to record her visions. He published these after her death in a book entitled "The Painful Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ" which inspired the actor and director Mel Gibson to make his film.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US troops in Iraq will push on with air stikes and ground offensives against rebel enclaves over the next three months to give the Iraqi government the best chance of restoring control ahead of elections in January, a senior official said. Iraq's fledgling security forces will play a bigger part in these operations with the number of army battalions set to increase five-fold by January, Brigadier General Erv Lessel told AFP. But a leading Sunni Muslim religious group criticised the logic of using brute force, such as a massive combined assault on the Sunni insurgent-held city of Samarra that left some 150 people dead, to achieve democratic goals. "It is desirable to achieve political ends without the use of military force, but recent operations have proven that force is usually required to remove terrorists and criminal elements from the cities of Iraq," insisted Lessel, chief spokesman for the US-led military in Iraq. When militants refused to disarm and take part in the political process, "there is no option other than the use of sufficient military force," he told AFP in an interview late Saturday. The Committee of Muslim Scholars, the leading religious organization for Iraq's ousted Sunni Arab elite, had asked how the government and its US allies could expect to prepare credible elections through the use of such overwhelming force. "Resorting to iron and fire to prepare for elections is a flawed method," the clerics said in a statement Saturday. "We throw on the government the responsibility for the injustices suffered by the inhabitants of the city of Samarra. "The campaign. is the latest in a series of aggressions against the city under the pretext of rebuilding security." Some 3,000 US troops and 2,000 Iraqi auxiliaries stormed Samarra at dawn Friday, sparking fierce fighting in the city of some 250,000 people. Lessel said he was confident that the assault would succeed in restoring full government control to the city which had been held by the insurgents since June. He compared the operation to a combined offensive in the central city of Najaf in August which culminated in Shiite militiamen ceding control to the government in a deal brokered by the spiritual leadership. "I think we will have a successful outcome like we saw in Najaf, where military operations helped achieve desired political objectives," the US general said. In Najaf, the rule of law had been re-established, the local government was in control and the lengthy task of reconstruction was under way, he said. Asked about warnings by US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld among others that elections might be impossible to organize on time in all parts of Iraq, Lessel acknowledged that the remaining insurgent enclaves posed a problem. But he insisted that as Iraq's own military strength grew, the government and its foreign allies ought to be able to flush out the rebels in time. "Our strategy is to strive for local control of cities throughout Iraq by the end of December, so that free and fair elections can be carried out in January," he said. "To achieve that we will have an increased number of trained and equipped Iraqi security forces available to conduct security operations." At present, the Iraqi army has six fully trained and equipped battalions but Lessel said he expected that number to rise to 27 by January. Similarly, the national guard's 45 battalions were expected to be boosted to 65 over about the same period. In a sign of their relentless resolve, US warplanes again pounded Iraq's most defiant insurgent enclave of Fallujah Sunday in what some saw as a prelude to a ground offensive to retake the town west of the capital which has been under rebel control since April.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Bangladesh's main opposition Awami League was Sunday holding its first public meeting amid ultra-tight security since a grenade attack on its rally in August that killed 21 people. Hours ahead of the meeting, Awami League supporters were seen streaming to the venue in downtown Dhaka but traffic movement in the area was thin due to security concerns, according to police. Opposition cadres drove the streets of the capital from early morning playing recorded speeches of their leaders through loudspeakers. Police said they were taking no chances and had beefed up security throughout the capital. "This is the topmost security measure taken for any political gathering -- since we don't want any repetition of August 21," Deputy Police Commissioner Obaidur Rahman told AFP. Some 8,000 law enforcers had been deployed to secure the meeting, while metal detectors have been placed at entrances to the venue and police video cameras will take footage of the event, he added. On Saturday, explosives experts combed the entire area. The August 21 attack, in which a number of grenades exploded as the Awami League rally was ending, was seen by party officials as an assassination bid on their leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed. A little-known Islamic group, Hikmatul Zihad, reportedly claimed responsibility and warned that a fresh attempt would be made on Sheikh Hasina's life. The secular Awami League has been waging a concerted campaign to oust the Islamist-allied coalition government, holding frequent strikes and demonstrations. It accuses the government, which holds an overwhelming parliamentary majority, of failing to tackle crime and corruption. The government, led by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has said it is working hard to clean up a grim law-and-order situation inherited from the previous Awami League administration.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Irish Catholic bishops to warn Irish about suicide epidemic.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[DUBLIN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Amid growing concern about the number of suicides in Ireland, particularly among young people, the country's 33 Roman Catholic bishops are to write to every home warning about the problem, it was announced Sunday. In their pastoral letter entitled "Life is for Living. A reflection on suicide," the bishops urge those thinking of taking their own lives to reconsider. The number of suicides has been rising over recent years in predominantly Catholic Ireland. The bishops say that although suicide had been uncommon in Ireland until the relatively recent past, it was now a "dark cloud" that has gathered over the nation. "Many lives have ended in tragic circumstances and others have been darkened by the heartbreaking reality of the death of a loved one through suicide. The lives of the young, in particular, have been overshadowed by this cloud." Last week, Ireland's Central Statistics Office reported that there had been 54 suicides in the first three months of the year in a population of just under four million, a bigger cause of death than road accidents, which claimed 36 lives. A fifth of all deaths among 15- to 34-year-olds were suicides, making it the largest cause of death in the age group. Males represented 74 percent of all suicides. The bishops argue that much of what supported Irish people in the past and prevented them from considering suicide seems to have vanished. "With economic success has come a weakening of faith for many and the loss of the sense of life as God's gift. With the laudable desire to remove the stigma which surrounded suicide from the families of those who have died has come the erosion of the recognition that suicide is an unthinkable option," they say. The bishops add that while Ireland has been blessed with exceptional economic success in recent years, many people still find themselves clinging to the "wreckage" of life as a result of problems. It was important to realise that suicide "has become a terrifying reality in our society, one which together we need to acknowledge and confront", the letter says. "We want to explore it with you and share with you our concerns and our support, in the hope that those who may think of suicide would reconsider their situation."]]></c>

Glazer has not gone public on any takeover bid he might have, but the Daily Star on Sunday quoted top banker Mehmet Dalman, who has helped Glazer snap up his existing United shares as saying: "The Glazer family - Malcolm and his sons Joel, Ed and Bryan - are interested in having a major involvement in United. "The Glazers want to own the club - either through buying more shares or through management or board level.'' The Mail on Sunday also cited unnamed sources as saying Glazer will soon approach United's board over a possible move. He is expected to seek the support of United's major shareholders, Irish racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9 per cent via their Cubic Expression company.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Slovenians vote in general elections expected to see right-wing gain ground.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenians were voting in tightly-contested general elections Sunday that may force the ruling centre-left coalition to form an alliance with the right-wing opposition after nearly 12 years in power. Prime Minister Anton Rop admitted that voting was likely to be very close and indicated that his Liberal Democracy party (LDS) would form a coalition with its rivals to remain in power. "I expect we'll score a solid relative victory, and we will create a good coalition capable of leading Slovenia forward," he said after casting his ballot at Vodice, 10 kilometres (six miles) north of Ljubljana. "I think results will be tight and that at first sight it might seem hard to agree on a coalition but some might be surprised how fast we will agree on it," Rop added. "I expect maybe a wider coalition but a stable government." Analysts say public support in the former Yugoslav state has shifted to the right over the past year-and-a-half and the party's main rival, the centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), would do well Sunday. Polls opened Sunday at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) and were due to close at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT). Exit poll projections are expected immediately after the closure of polls. Over 20 parties, eight of them represented in parliament, were contesting the 90 seats in the legislature, in the first national election in Slovenia since it joined the European Union last May. The country's electoral commission is expected to publish first partial results after 10:00 pm (2000 GMT). Opinion polls forecast a turnout of over 70 percent of the country's registered 1.6 million voters compared to 28 percent in European parliament elections in June. Voter turnout is expected to be crucial -- the opposition fared well in European parliamentary elections in June when participation was low. "It would be very hard to forecast a winner. All scenarios are possible," Miha Kovac, columnist for the newspaper Dnevnik, told AFP. A poll by the influential newspaper Delo predicted the opposition SDS would win the most votes, with 21.5 percent, followed by the LDS with 21.3 percent. This was with a projected turnout of around 74 percent. The future parliament is expected to have two almost equal blocs, which will make decision-making more complicated than in the outgoing legislature, where the LDS and its allies control 58 seats out of 90. SDS leader Janez Jansa's campaign was centered this year on blaming the LDS for failing to deliver on promises it made in 2000, especially those concerning economic growth, highway construction and increase of pensions. "Over the last four years the LDS has made five fouls (as in basketball) and it is time for voters to replace it as in every fair-play game," he said at a rally in Ljubljana on Wednesday as he wrapped up his campaign. But Rop has defended his record, saying that the cabinet he took over in 2002 led the country into the EU and NATO, started the process for entering the eurozone by 2007, reduced unemployment and is on its way to making Slovenia one of the EU's most developed countries. He denied Sunday that tense relations with neighbouring Croatia, involving territorial disputes, had dented the government's support. "I believe that will not have a strong effect on elections, I don't think that will be decisive," he told journalists. "Relations with Croatia will be good if Croatia decides to join the EU and follow the European path." The Slovenian Journalists' Union (SNS) was observing a limited strike Sunday to call for a new collective agreement for journalists. But the strike will not prevent journalists from publishing reports on the elections.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Argentina's Guillermo Canas crushed unheralded German Lars Burgsmuller in the final of the Shanghai ATP tennis tournament on Sunday, conceding just one game in the 57-minute match. Third seed Canas outclassed his 123rd ranked opponent 6-1, 6-0 in an awesome display of speed and power to come away the victor of the 380,500 dollar event. An aggressive Burgsmuller tried to take the game to Canas, attacking from all angles, but the quicker and determined Buenos Aires native always had an answer as he outran and outgunned the 28-year-old German. "I played the beginning of the match and then I got better and better and I think that is why you had this (final) score," said Canas. Canas, 26, set the tone of the match early as he broke Burgsmuller in the third game of the first set. It was a harbinger of what was to come as the unseeded Mulheim resident succumbed in the fifth game and again in the seventh as too many nearly certain winners sailed wide or into the net. A change of shirt from white to black did little to change Burgsmuller's fortunes in the second set. He continued to struggle to hit the mark with his first serve, while also faltering on key points that could have kept him apace of his opponent. "He played very good and he didn't miss any shots and I missed a lot," said a disappointed Burgsmuller. "I didn't make the important points right from the beginning." Shanghai was Burgsmuller's second singles final this year after Heilbronn. He was a finalist in Casablanca four years ago and he won his only ATP trophy in Copenhagen in 2002. For Canas, who is set to move up in the world rankings from his current 24th, it was his third title of the year and a vindication for missing most of 2002 and last year recuperating from surgery on his wrist. With his sixth career ATP title in the bag, following back-to-back tournaments at Umag and Stuttgart in July, Canas has no doubts about where he wants to go. "My next goal is to try and get into the top 10," said Canas, who will play in the Japan Open next week. "I will try to play my best tennnis (in Japan), if I do, I have a chance to win there too," he said. Canas has now won 18 of his last 19 matches, with his only loss coming at the hands of 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Iran asserted Sunday that it had already had the technology to produce its own nuclear fuel and said it would be "irrational" to surrender the capability in exchange for supplies from overseas. "One should not put one's fate in the hands of others. It would irrational," said foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi. "We have the technology and there is no need for us to beg from others. This suggestion is good for countries that do not have this technology, but we do not need their generosity and help," he added. Asefi was reacting to US Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry, who has suggested providing Iran with nuclear fuel to generate electricity if Iran agreed to give up its controversial work on the sensitive nuclear fuel cycle. In a debate with US President George W. Bush, Kerry said the United States should have joined a British-French-German initiative aimed at getting Iran to agree to stop work surrounding the enrichment of uranium. Fuel cycle work for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), of which Iran is a signatory, but the process can also be used to produce the core of an atomic bomb. But Asefi repeated the assertion here that Iran needs to be self-sufficient when it comes to fueling it atomic energy programme, and would not accept being dependent on supplies from overseas. "What guarantees are there. Will they supply us one day, and then if they want to, stop supplying us another day." he said.]]></c>

"There are different types of captains. Eric Cantona led by example on the pitch and after the game sat down with the players and talked to them. "Then you have your traditional, driving United captains - Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce and Roy Keane. "I think Rio has a bit of both styles.

		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Their ranks thinning with the years, several hundred Communists unfurled red banners Sunday and marched through a chilly Moscow to mark the 11th anniversary of the day Boris Yeltsin used tanks to shell parliament, putting a bloody end to their hardline revolt. Aging Communists and teenage nationalists joining ranks as they gathered under a statue of Lenin in southern Moscow before marching in unison on what is now the government building but what in 1993 served as Russia's parliament. The chamber was dominated by Communist and ultra-nationalist forces who wrestled for power with Yeltsin, as post-Soviet Russia faced a constitutional crisis that the Russian president chose to resolve by shelling the building with tanks. Fighting aross Moscow killed 148 people, according to the official toll, breathing a poisonous air into Russia's democratic reforms. The way the anniversary is marked now has reflected the modern course of Russia's politics. It brought tens of thousands of people out on to the streets in the 1990s amid economic chaos, hyperinflation and frustration with Yeltsin's commitment to democracy but seeming inability to get the economy on course. Those steadily died down under the reign of President Vladimir Putin, and the police presence in front of the government building Sunday afternoon was greater than that of demonstrators, who only numbered in the dozens, but whose ranks were expected to grow. "We must wring the necks of the bourgeoisie," one elderly woman told Russian state television with a hint of a smile on her face, a familiar refrain at these rallies. In late September 1993, after Yeltsin signed a decree dissolving the Supreme Soviet, as the legislature was then called, the Communist-dominated parliament voted to remove the Russian leader and handed his powers to his vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, who joined the opposition. Anti-Yeltsin protests began on October 2 and escalated the following day as parliament supporters barricaded themselves inside the White House, seized the Moscow mayor's offices and took over part of the national television centre. But on Monday October 4, troops and tanks loyal to Yeltsin opened fire on the White House and by the next morning the rebellion had been crushed.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The bloodied uniform of a British policeman murdered by a machete-wielding mob during a riot in London 19 years ago has been removed from a crime museum for new forensic tests, police said on Sunday. The uniform of Keith Blakelock, who was hacked to death during violence on a housing estate in Tottenham, north London, in October 1985, a murder which shocked Britain, has been taken from Scotland Yard's private crime museum. It will undergo DNA testing in connection with new leads into the murder, which police hope could finally solve the case. Blakelock died and a colleague was badly injured when they were attacked during fierce rioting sparked by the death of a woman who collapsed when police raided her home on the sprawling Broadwater Farm housing estate. Three men were jailed in 1987 for the killing, but were released four years later after it became clear much of the evidence against them was seriously flawed, with some allegedly fabricated by police. A new investigation into the murder began last year, and in September police dug up a garden near the murder scene and found "an item of interest", reportedly a machete. Blakelock's uniform -- minus his helmet, which has never been found -- is kept in what is dubbed the "Black Museum", which contains weapons and other items from notorious crimes investigated by Scotland Yard, London's police force. It is not open to the public and is used to train police and forensic officers. "We can confirm that PC Blakelock's uniform has been removed from the New Scotland Yard crime museum," a police spokeswoman said. "The uniform will be subjected to forensic testing as part of a new inquiry."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Michael Caine gangster movie voted best-ever British film.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Gritty 1971 gangster film "Get Carter" starring Michael Caine has been voted the best British film ever made, according to results of a magazine poll published on Sunday. The film, in which Caine stars as a tough London hoodlum seeking revenge for the death of his brother, just beat "A Matter of Life and Death", a quirky 1946 film in which David Niven plays a British wartime aviator who cheats death. The poll of movie critics conducted by Total Film magazine was slanted heavily towards older classics, with only one film made in the last decade, 1996 drug drama "Trainspotting", making the top 10. The experts also turned up their noses at a quartet of heavily lauded films, "The English Patient" from 1996, 1981's "Chariots of Fire", "Gandhi" from 1983 and "Oliver." from 1968. Despite winning a combined total of 26 Oscars between them, none of the films made the top 50 poll. And while top-grossing Hugh Grant romantic comedy "Four Weddings and a Funeral" was voted in at 26, similar box office smashes also featuring Grant, "Notting Hill", "Love Actually" and "Bridget Jones's Diary" were ignored. The top 25 films in the poll, and their year of release, were: 1. Get Carter (1971) 2. A Matter of Life and Death (1946) 3. Trainspotting (1996) 4. The Third Man (1949) 5. Life of Brian (1979) 6. The Wicker Man (1973) 7. Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) 8. Lawrence of Arabia (1962) 9. From Russia with Love (1963) 10. Naked (1993) 11. Billy Liar (1963) 12. A Clockwork Orange (1971) 13. Withnail and I (1987) 14. Great Expectations (1946) 15. If. (1968) 16. Kes (1969) 17. Brighton Rock (1947) 18. Don't Look Now (1973) 19. Sexy Beast (2000) 20. Brazil (1985) 21. Blowup (1966) 22.

		<d><![CDATA[ALMATY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Kazakhstan on Sunday held run-off polls in a parliamentary election that has been criticized by the West and written off by opponents of the oil-rich country's President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The polls to the 77-seat lower house of parliament, or majilis, were taking place in 22 constituencies where no single candidate won a majority at a September 19 first round. Nazarbayev's Otan (Fatherland) party has already claimed victory, saying it expected to win at least a 60 percent majority in parliament, which rarely crosses the president but has been promised more powers. By mid-Sunday afternoon, some 25 percent of eligible voters had cast their vote, according to the electoral commission's Internet site. Failings in the process have been highlighted by both Washington and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), particularly over the rushed introduction of electronic voting and the absence of numerous eligible voters from electoral rolls. "We believe the central election commission has functioned in an arbitrary, selective and non-transparent manner," Robert Barry, head of an OSCE observer team, said before the vote. Opposition parties have voiced outrage at what they say has been a deliberate effort to falsify the elections, particularly in the largest city Almaty, where three seats were to be allotted at Sunday's polling. An opposition rally planned for October 2 had been postponed for one week however, the Ak Zhol (Bright Path) party said. The participation of the Asar (All Together) party of the president's daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva has prompted speculation that she may eventually hope to succeed her father. Nazarbayev was Kazakhstan's last Soviet-era leader and has clung on through a series of elections and referenda criticized by the West as flawed. He has said he hopes to stand again at presidential elections in 2006.]]></c>

Reseachers from the University of Derby spent 18 months browsing Internet health sites which offer advice on the common symptoms and treatment of a huge range of illnesses, from colds to cancer. They found that misleading or vague advice could easily lead people to incorrectly diagnose their symptoms. "We found that people using these sites can take on board medical advice which is incorrect -- an obvious concern," said Dr Neil Coulson, who led the research team. "Indeed, the health profession has coined the phrase 'cyberchondria' for people using the Internet for self diagnosis and presenting this misinformation to their GP (general practitioner)." The study found that while most sites linked to societies, charities or professional bodies gave sound advice, those run by individuals could include glaring inaccuracies.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korea's military and police on Sunday tightened security after receiving a fresh Al-Qaeda threat against the country and other US allies which have troops in Iraq, officials said. The Joint Chiefs of Staff office issued an emergency instruction for all military units to improve security against possible terrorist attacks. "With all counter-terrorism units put on a high alert, troops operating overseas are ordered to refrain from engaging in activities outside bases under the emergency instruction," an official of the office said. About 5,000 policemen are also on heightened alert to counter any attacks on key facilities including the US embassy, said the National Police Agency's anti-terror task force. Police commandos were posted near the high-walled and barricaded American embassy in Seoul and police with sniffer dogs stepped up their patrols at airports, the task force said. The foreign ministry held a seperate anti-terrorism task force meeting Sunday as a follow-up to its previous-day instructions for embassies overseas to step up security for South Korean interests. Counter-terrorism officials from 16 government agencies are also to meet for working-level talks on Tuesday to discuss the Al-Qaeda threat. Al-Jazeera television broadcast Friday a message attributed to Al-Qaeda number two Ayman al-Zawahiri urging Muslims to attack member countries of the US-led coalition in Iraq. The message said: "We should start the resistance from now. The interests of the Americans, English, Australian, French, Polish, Norwegians, South Korean and Japanese are everywhere." South Korea recently sent 2,800 troops to Arbil, a Kurdish-controlled town in the north of Iraq. With another 800 troops to be sent in November, the South Korean contingent makes up the third largest foreign force in the coalition. Islamic militants beheaded a South Korean hostage, Kim Sun-Il, in June after President Roh Moo-Hyun rejected their demand that Seoul scrap its plan to send troops to Iraq. In August a group calling itself Ashap Rayat Sud (Black Banners), linked to the Islamic militant organization Ansar al-Sunna, sent a videotape to Seoul, threatening to attack South Korean troops and citizens in retaliation. Ansar al-Sunna has claimed responsibility for many attacks, including a suicide bombing which killed at least 105 in Arbil in February.]]></c>

Budget Secretary Emilia Boncodin said the agencies all suffered low collection efficiency, insufficient corporate funds to cover operations, money-losing subsidiaries and charters that restrict their capacity to raise revenue. She said the budget and finance departments would still conduct a joint review of the 15 government financial institutions and government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs) before deciding what to do with them. Among the 15 money-losers is the National Power Corp. (Napocor), the country's main power producer. Also included are two railway systems, the irrigation administration, three housing agencies, offices overseeing the coconut and tobacco industries, the crop insurance system, the Philippine National Oil Company and the state-run Islamic bank. The list also covers the state television station, the rice-importing agency and a state holding firm.

		<d><![CDATA[PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The governor of southern Nigeria's Rivers State, at the heart of the restive oil-rich Niger Delta, on Sunday offered an amnesty to local gang leaders if their followers hand in their weapons. Two gangs fighting for supremacy over the oil wealth in the region, the hub of Nigeria's lucrative oil industry, signed a ceasefire and disarmament agreement in Abuja on Friday after months of violence. The unrest in the region sent world oil prices soaring last week. The Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force led by Mujahid Dokubo Asari and Akete Tom, leader of a rival gang, signed the peace deal at the instance of President Olusegun Obasanjo. "Our earlier amnesty for those who have offered to renounce violence and voluntarily surrender their weapons stills stands and will be vigorously pursued," said Governor Peter Odili in a state broadcast here Sunday. Odili said a peace committee would be set up "in the next few days to reach out to members of the militia groups and cult gangs so that they can be rehabilitated and integrated into the larger society to pursue their economic and political aspirations and interests". "Peace has no price," he said, adding that the government will continue to pursue policies and programmes that will create more jobs and increase infrastructural development to reduce tension and restiveness in the region. Various armed gangs have been terrorising Port Harcourt, the capital and nerve-centre of Nigeria's multi-billion-dollar oil industry and its surrounding creeks in the past month. The gangs are financed by illegal bunkering -- stealing of crude oil from tapped pipelines before selling it to local and foreign buyers. According to Amnesty International, some 500 people have been killed following the unrest, but government officials disputed the figure, saying only 13 died. Last Monday, Asari's group had threatened oil installations and told foreign oil workers to quit the region, triggering fright in the international oil market and helping push the price per barrel to around 50 dollars.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GENEVA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[European football's governing body UEFA has given the Austrian and Swiss football federations until the end of the year to clear up shortcomings in their organisation of the tournament, a Swiss newspaper reported Sunday. UEFA's top officials wrote to both federations to warn them that rival bids which lost out in the race to host Euro 2008 could challenge the decision to award it to Austria and Switzerland, Sonntagszeitung said. The governing body reportedly said it had not been informed about alternative arrangements after plans for one of the eight stadiums in the Swiss city of Zurich fell through last month and demanded a response by December 31. It also called on the two federations to come up with signed contracts with the other stadia by the end of November and criticised an apparent lack of political backing for the project in the two countries. The amounts of money set aside for security in the project, notably in Switzerland, were regarded as inadequate, and other financial arrangements needed to be cleared up, according to the letter. UEFA could not be contacted about the report Sunday, which carried a picture of the faxed letterhead and quoted extracts. "We are taking this letter very seriously," Swiss football federation (ASF) president Ralph Zloczower said in the newspaper. Austria and Switzerland edged out Hungary as well as joint bids from Greece and Turkey, Ireland and Scotland, and four Nordic countries in the race to host Euro 2008 two years ago.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova returns to the scene of her first WTA title win to spearhead the field at this week's Japan Open tennis tournament. The 17-year-old Russian heart-throb posted her first WTA doubles title with Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand here a year ago and added her first singles title the following day. Sharapova has since enjoyed victories at Quebec City and Birmingham and trounced former world number one Serena Wiliams of the United States in the Wimbledon final for her first Grand Slam victory. On Sunday, Sharapova, losing semi-finalist to Russia's US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in Beijing two weeks ago, defeated Marta Domachowska of Poland 6-1, 6-1 to win the Korea Open for her fifth career singles title. Her biggest threat in the 860,000-dollar even should come from second-seeded French teenager Tatiana Golovin after the withdrawals of Jelena Dokic of Serbia and Montenegro and two-time Japan Open champion Amy Frazier of the United States. The top-seeded Russian is in the top half with US fifth seed Meghann Shaughnessy, third seed Shinobu Asagoe of Japan and eighth seed Arantxa Parra Santonja of Spain. Golovin was drawn with seventh seed Klara Koukalova of the Czech Republic, fourth seed Kristina Brandi of Puerto Rico, and sixth seed Nicole Pratt of Australia. The men's field is led by top seed Lleyton Hewitt of Australia and second seed David Nalbandian of Argentina, the respective 2002 Wimbledon champion and losing finalist, and Asia's number one Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand. Hewitt receives a first-round bye before taking on either American Glenn Weiner or Goichi Motomura of Japan in the top quarter of the draw, which includes French ninth seed Cyril Saulnier and eighth seed Thomas Johansson of Sweden. Paradorn, the tournament's fourth seed, was drawn in the same half as Hewitt with fifth seed Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic. Joining Nalbandian in the draw's bottom half will be Mark Philippoussis of Australia and two former Japan Open winners -- Romanian third seed Andrei Pavel and unseeded Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark. French Open champion Gaston Gaudio of Argentina pulled out due to an ankle injury, while Zheng Jie, who became the first Chinese player to reach the fourth round of the Paris Grand Slam in May, could not get a visa for the event.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[We hold the edge over Australia, says India captain by Kuldip Lal.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BANGALORE, India, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has raised the stakes in the Test series against Australia starting on Wednesday, saying the world champions had reason to fear his team. And even though the Indians have had a poor run in limited-overs tournaments this season, Ganguly believes the hosts have a "huge psychological advantage" going into the highly-anticipated series. "I am certain they are worried about playing us," Ganguly told AFP ahead of the first Test at the Chinnaswamy stadium here. "The Aussies know that we are the only side that comes hard at them. And that will be a huge psychological advantage for us. "We are always formidable at home and they know it. I am not saying we will certainly win the series, you can't predict that, but it will be a very, very close contest." Australia, who last won a Test series on Indian soil in 1969 under Bill Lawry, have lost five of the last seven Tests they played here since 1996. In 2001, Ganguly's men fought back from a four-day drubbing in the first Test and a 274-run deficit in the second to conjure up a stunning 2-1 series win in the final session of the third and final Test. That the Indians reserve their best cricket for the Australians was evident on the tour down under last season when they held Steve Waugh's world beaters to a 1-1 draw. "The Aussies bring out the best in us," Ganguly said. "And I am confident the same will happen again despite a very ordinary start to the season where we played poor cricket." India, the 2003 World Cup finalists, failed to win four one-day tournaments over the last two months in Sri Lanka, the Netherlands and England, including the Champions Trophy. Ganguly, India's most successful Test captain with 15 wins, concedes the Australian series will test his leadership qualities. "Maybe you are only as good as the team you lead, but I have never shirked away from the responhe Australians are no exception. It will put them in a lot of pressure." Ponting has been ruled out of the first two Tests of the four-match series with a broken thumb suffered during the Champions Trophy. Adam Gilchrist will lead the tourists in his absence.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGALORE, India, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Australia's caretaker captain Adam Gilchrist is confident India's spin wizards will hold no demons for his team when the Test series starts here on Wednesday. "We are all ready to go," Gilchrist told reporters as his team prepared for the keenly awaited four-match series that has caught the imagination of cricket lovers around the world. "We've toured India and Sri Lanka and we feel very comfortable with our game plans and how we approach the spinners. "All the guys are looking forward to the Test. There are no real demons out there for us now." The world champions consider India the 'last frontier' where they have not won a series since 1969 and lost five of the last seven Tests. The most memorable contest between the two came in 2001 when the hosts rode on Venkatsai Laxman's 281 in the second Test and a 32-wicket series haul by off-spinner Harbhajan Singh to stun Steve Waugh's world-beaters. India, who lost the first Test inside four days and trailed by 274 runs in the second, fought back to win the series 2-1 in the last session of the third and final Test in Madras. Harbhajan will once again carry India's hopes along with seasoned leg-spinner Anil Kumble, who needs three wickets to join the exclusive 400-wicket club. Gilchrist, standing in for the injured Ricky Ponting for the first two Tests, said his team was better prepared now to tackle the hosts. The flamboyant wicketkeeper-batsman was delighted at his side's totals of 302-7 declared and 207-1 in the three-day practice match at Bombay on a wicket where the ball turned and jumped viciously. "We had a quality time out in the middle against the spinners," he said of the game against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai which ended in a draw on Saturday. "Now it depends on how we take this lesson into the Test series. "We have come with a game plan on tackling the Indian spinners. It depends on how we execute that plan." Left-handed Justin Langer beat the stifling hot weather to make 108 while opening partner Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke hit half-centuries. "It was good to start the tour like this," Gilchrist said. "We lost half a day due to rains, otherwise there could have been a result. Still we had a few good days in Bombay." Clarke looks certain to make his Test debut, while Simon Katich is likely to move to the pivotal number three place left vacant by Ponting. Particularly heartening for the tourists was the form shown by premier fast bowler Glenn McGrath, who missed the home series against India and the tour of Sri Lanka earlier this year through injury. The 34-year-old was his usual accurate and miserly self, picking up 4-25 in 21.2 overs, and ended speculation he may be replaced by Brett Lee for the first Test at the Chinnaswamy stadium here. McGrath, Test cricket's fourth highest wicket-taker with 440 victims, will join Jason Gillespie, Michael nisters, having pronounced himself in "excellent" health as he set off there on Saturday, accompanied by his wife Cherie. It was a welcome rest after a rough-and-tumble week in which Blair tried to heal divisions over Iraq at the Labour Party conference, then underwent a two-and-a-half hour operation Friday to correct a recurring irregular heartbeat. In announcing his heart operation late Thursday, Blair also surprised the political establishment by declaring that if Labour won a general election, expected in mid-2005, he would serve a third complete term as prime minister. No other British premier has ever made such an announcement. It has been seen by pundits as a shrewd attempt by Blair to head off challenges to his own leadership inside an increasingly restive Labour Party. The prime minister had no meetings scheduled for the weekend, but it will be a return to full business at 10 Downing Street on Monday, with a trip to Africa starting the next day. Blair'ts expect Labour to win the next election. This has led to warnings that Blair's third term of office could be dominated by Brown and other would-be leadership contenders jockeying for position in the promised succession race. However Prescott, a blunt-spoken veteran politician with a fierce loyalty to Blair, insisted Labour MPs were happy with the prime minister's plans, and dismissed what he called "press prattle" about in-fighting. "I think the reaction in the party is that they are pleased, basically, that there's a timetable," he said, warning also that any actions seen as damaging Labour would be viewed very dimly. "If the party feels that in any way the personal ambitions of individuals threaten the possibility of our party winning the next election. then I think they will feel angry about it," he said. "What's absolutely clear, make no mistake, the electorate do not like parties that are disunited, fighting amongst themselves."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Sharon vows Gaza offensive will go on as death toll tops 60.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[JERUSALEM, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed Sunday to press ahead with a vast military offensive in the northern Gaza Strip that has left more than 60 people dead in five days, almost all of them Palestinians. "This is not a short operation. We should act for as long as the danger exists," Sharon told army radio in his first public comments on the operation. The Palestinians lashed out at the international community for its "silence" in the face of the incursion, the largest in the impoverished Gaza Strip since the start of the Palestinian uprising four years ago. Sharon said he had "given the order to change the situation on the Gaza front, to hit at the terrorists, their leadership and those who send them, along with those responsible for making weapons". A total of 62 people have been killed in fighting since late Tuesday when the army launched the "Days of Penitence" operation in a bid to prevent rocket attacks by militants. The dead include 59 Palestinians, both civilians and gunmen, and three Israelis, including two soldiers. The death toll has swept past that of a May operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than 40 Palestinians were killed as Israel sought to destroy cross-border weapons-smuggling tunnels. Overnight, three members of the Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad movement, were killed in the densely populated Jabaliya area of the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said, An army spokeswoman said troops had shot dead a man preparing to launch an anti-tank missile, while another group of soldiers had opened fire on a group of gunmen who were trying to booby-trap a road. Despite the spiralling bloodshed, which escalated Wednesday after a rocket killed two Israeli toddlers in southern Israel, Sharon said the operation would continue until troops stamped out the ability of militants to fire missiles at Israel. "We must broaden the area of action to push back the rocket launchers so Jewish areas along the border are no longer within their range," Sharon said, adding the aim was also to halt fire on Jewish settlements in Gaza, both in the immediate term and during implementation of his so-called disengagement plan. Under terms of the plan, all Jewish settlers and troops are to be evacuated from the Gaza Strip by the end of 2005. The Palestinian cabinet on Saturday declared a state of emergency, with Yasser Arafat appealing for international help against the "criminal and racist" Israeli campaign. On Sunday, the Palestinian parliament was holding an emergency session, with MPs mulling a proposal to give up one day's salary for victims of the raids. Palestinian negotiations minister Saeb Erakat had harsh words for the international"if many Palestinian civilians became victims of collateral damage". Amos Gilad, head of the defence ministry's political bureau, also said the operation would continue "as until now, the majority of Palestinians killed were terrorists". In other violence, eight Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets in Beit Awwa village in the southern West Bank after demonstrators protesting against Israel's construction of a vast barrier across the territory, clashed with Israeli forces, medics and security sources said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Darfur rebels reject Khartoum bid to split them ahead of talks (ADDS new government accusations).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[KHARTOUM, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Ethnic minority rebels in Darfur have rejected an attempt by the Sudanese government to divide them ahead of a new round of peace talks in Nigeria later this month, a Khartoum daily reported Sunday. The Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) said it would not take part in the talks in Abuja on October 21 unless fellow rebels from the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) were also allowed to take part. Khartoum "has no right to name which of the opposition movements can take part in the talks but can name its own delegation," SLM spokesman Mahjoub Hussein told the Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper from his base in London. The Sudanese government has accused the JEM of complicity in an alleged coup attempt in Khartoum last month by the Popular Congress party of jailed Islamist opposition leader Hassan al-Turabi and rejected it as a negotiating partner. But the rebels, along with nearly all the other myriad armed groups opposed to the military-backed regime in Khartoum, charge that the alleged coup bid never took place and was a mere governemt ploy to divert attention from its mounting diplomatic woes. The SLM spokesman expressed concern that Khartoum was set to retain its hardline pointman on Darfur -- Agriculture Minister Majzoub al-Khalifa Ahmed -- for the next round of negotiations for an end to the 20-month conflict in the vast western region. The current team "lacked the political vision needed for the negotiations," Hussein said. The agriculture minister has been outspoken in rejecting mounting international pressure for a genuinely federal system to address the grievances of Sudan's non-Arab minorities in the north as well as the south. On Thursday he was quoted as saying that Khartoum "does not speak at the moment about autonomy to any region in the north," backtracking on pledges by other ministers that self-rule for Darfur's indigenous minorities was on the table. A government official meanwhile accused the SLM as well as the JEM of "conspiring" with the Popular Congress and charged that representatives of both factions had abused their positions on an African Union ceasefire observer mission to further their uprising. The governor of North Darfur state, Osman Yusuf Kibir, told Akhbar Al-Youm that the rebel observers had been "instigating disturbances" in the huge tent cities that have sprung up across the region to accommodate the 1.2 million people displaced by the conflict inside Sudan. He said weapons had been found hidden in a graveyard in the Zamzam camp south of the state of capital of El Fasher and charged that the camps had been infiltrated by Popular Congress saboteurs. Kibir said the alleged mastermind of last month's coup plot, Al-Haj Adam Yusuf, had travelled to eastern Darfur along with an Islamist now in custody -- Ahmed Bekheit -- to liaise with the rebels. Officesolutions and an agreement with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Khartoum has yet to meet demands to stem what the United Nations describes as the world's worst current humanitarian crisis.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Lebanon FM accuses Annan of bias.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BEIRUT, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Lebanese Foreign Minister Jean Obeid accused UN chief Kofi Annan Sunday of making a biased assessment of international respect for Beirut's sovereignty that highlighted Syrian breaches while ignoring Israel's. "Annan's report on Lebanon and Syria is extreme and exaggerated and lets Israel off too lightly by ignoring its violations," Obeid told reporters. "We would have hoped for a fairer, more accurate and comprehensive report." The UN chief reported Friday that Syria had failed to comply with a UN Security Council resolution demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and an end to outside meddling in its affairs. He said he had been able to obtain no timetable for the withdrawal of the remaining 15,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon, which the two governments say are deployed by mutual consent. Annan referred to Israel's 22-year occupation of south Lebanon, ended in 2000, but did not hightlight its continuing occupation of the Shebaa Farms district, part of Syria now claimed by Beirut with Damascus's consent, or its repeated violations of Lebanese air space since its pullout. Other officials were less critical of Annan, acknowledging that he had set out to state the facts in the 30-day compliance report required by the Security Council resolution. "The report is not bad and does set things out as they are," Deputy Prime Minister Issam Fares told the Saudi-owned daily Al-Hayat. "I did not consider the report bad or extreme despite the pressure placed on the UN secretariat to make it hard-hitting." Syria's official media also took a softer line. "The whole world followed with interest the UN secretary general's report which reflected the realities," the government daily Ath-Thawra said. "The report discussed the role of Syrian forces in enabling Lebanon to recover its security and stability. "It recalled the agreements between Syria and Lebanon which provided the framework and legal basis for military cooperation between the two countries."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenians were voting in hotly contested general elections Sunday that may force the ruling centre-left coalition to form an alliance with the right-wing opposition after nearly 12 years in power. Prime Minister Anton Rop admitted that voting was likely to be very close and indicated that his Liberal Democracy party (LDS) would form a coalition with its rivals to remain in power. "I expect we'll score a solid relative victory, and we will create a good coalition capable of leading Slovenia forward," he said after casting his ballot at Vodice, 10 kilometres (six miles) north of the capital Ljubljana. "I think results will be tight and that at first sight it might seem hard to agree on a coalition but some might be surprised how fast we will agree on it," Rop added. "I expect maybe a wider coalition but a stable government." Analysts say public support in the former Yugoslav republic has shifted to the right over the past year-and-a-half and the party's main rival, the centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), would do well Sunday. SDS leader Janez Jansa told reporters: "I expect a good outcome both for the SDS and Coalition Slovenia (consisting of the SDS and the conservative New Slovenia party). We in fact need a really good result in order to change Slovenian politics." "I hope Coalition Slovenia will gain a sufficient majority and that the less possible number of partners will be needed for the future coalition. Wide coalitions usually mean. inefficient rule." Jansa was speaking after voting in Lju for a new collective agreement for journalists. But the strike will not prevent journalists from publishing reports on the elections. The country's electoral commission is expected to publish first partial results after 10:00 pm (2000 GMT).]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Scores of Iraqi Kurds took to the streets of Kirkuk Sunday to demand that Arab families settled in the northern oil centre by Saddam Hussein's regime now leave. In a second day of demonstrations in the ethnically divided city, protestors brandished banners calling for the "departure of the Arabs" and "the return of Kurds chased from their homes" as part of Saddam's efforts to change its population makeup. Demonstrators also called for the departure of loyalists of the old regime they accused of blocking the return of displaced Kurds. The question of the Kurds' return and the continuing presence of Arabs installed in the city before the overthrow of Saddam in April 2003 has fuelled tensions in Kirkuk, which is also inhabited by Turkmen. The interim government has so far roundly rejected calls for the expulsion of the settlers. "Kirkuk should be a city of peaceful coexistence and the new Iraq will not force anyone to leave their home," President Ghazi al-Yawar said during a visit to the city in June shortly before his government assumed full powers. "Your remarks are harsh and I can't accept them," the Sunni Arab head of state said in response to a call from the city's Kurdish deputy governor, Hassib Ruj Bayani, to "chase foreigners out". On Saturday, thousands of Kurds rallied in Kirkuk to demand that it be made the capital of an independent Kurdish state. The two main Kurdish political parties want the city incorporated in an enlarged autonomous Kurdish region but reject the idea of independence, knowing it would be unacceptable to Iraq's neighbours.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The people of Serbia voted on Sunday in the first local elections in the country since nationalist president strongman Slobodan Milosevic and his regime were ousted, with moderates and ultra-nationalists battling for pre-eminence. The second round vote comes after Serbian reformist President Boris Tadic and moderate nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica joined forces following the first round on September 19 in a bid to defeat the hardline nationalist Serbian Radical Party in the run-off. Polling stations opened in 148 municipalities at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) and were due to close at 8:00 pm (1800 GMT). Initial turnout figures showed that between two and four percent of voters cast their ballots in the first two hours of the vote. In Belgrade, only 5.5 percent of those registered had cast their ballots by 10:00 am (0800 GMT), the electoral commission said. Speaking after he voted, Kostunica said the outcome of the polls would be "very important as it leads to a significant reform of Serbia's political system." "These are the first local elections held under democratic conditions and rules," Kostunica told reporters in Belgrade. Tadic's Democratic Party (DS) won around 30 percent of the vote in the first round of the ballot two weeks ago, while the Radicals obtained 27 percent. Their candidates face each other in a run-off for the post of mayor in Belgrade and most other Serbian towns. This is the first time mayors are being elected directly, following the introduction of new electoral laws. In the capital Belgrade, Democratic Party candidate Nenad Bogdanovic is expected to defeat ultra-nationalist Aleksandar Vucic. The position of Belgrade mayor is considered the third most important post in the country, after that of prime minister and president. Belgrade's mayor controls a capital city with a population of 1.7 million. After the first round Tadic and Kostunica reached an agreement to form coalitions in local parliaments and fight together against the Radicals in the second round. The Radicals became the strongest single party in the Serbian parliament after the general election in December 2003 but were unable to form a government. This is the first such deal between the moderate parties since Tadic was elected president in June but the fraught relations between the two camps may make its application difficult. Analysts warned the importance of the vote was "more significant than on the mere local level." "Political and economic reforms launched four years ago (after Milosevic's fall) although slower than expected, could halt completely if the Radicals come to power," analyst Divna Vukomanovic told AFP. In Serbia's second largest town Novi Sad, Tadic's Democratic Party was hoping for a strong showing in the capital of Vojvodina province, wherday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GUWAHATI, India, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[India's insurgency-racked northeast was reeling Sunday from one of its deadliest waves of violence in years, as police reported more killings overnight that brought the death toll to 53 with 161 injured. A string of bloody blasts and shootouts in adjoining Assam and Nagaland states on Saturday killed at least 44 people. Overnight another five victims died in hospital while four others were killed in fresh violence, police said Sunday. In New York, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan strongly condemned the bombings and shootings, saying he had learnt of the violence with "shock and dismay." The attacks came as India Saturday commemorated the birth of the country's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, a champion of non-violence. It also coincided with the 18th anniversary of the founding of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), one of around 30 rebel groups fighting for greater autonomy or independence in the region. In violence Sunday, which followed the widescale bloodletting of the previous day, 15 people were wounded when rebels lobbed a grenade at shoppers in a teeming market in northern Assam's Sonitpur district, 180 kilometres (112 miles) from the main city Guwahati, a police spokesman said. Another 20 people were injured in two blasts in Gossaigaon and Baska areas of western Assam, he added. Late Saturday, one person was killed when gunmen fired on a train near Bagmari village in eastern Assam's Karbi Anglong district. In another incident, three NDFB rebels were killed when an explosive device they were planting exploded in northern Assam's Darrang district early Sunday, police said. The bloodshed began Saturday in Dimapur, the commercial hub of Nagaland, when three bombs exploded almost simultaneously in what an official called the "worst ever terrorist strike" in the tiny state's history. Police said the plastic explosive RDX appeared to have been used in a powerful blast at a railway station in Dimapur that dug out a large crater next to a platform packed with passengers waiting for a train. "There were limbs everywhere and blood was splattered all over," said student leader T. Zheviho. India's Home Minister Shivraj Patil who arrived in Nagaland Sunday on a fact-finding mission after a brief stopover in Assam, said the government would take "very strong steps" to deal with mili said 11 were killed and 12 injured. Assam police official Khagen Sharma blamed the attacks on the United Liberation Front of Asom and the NDFB. A NDFB statement Sunday claimed responsibility for the shootouts in Assam saying: "The attacks were a proof of our strength." More than 50,000 people have died in the remote northeast in nearly six decades of fighting between security forces and rebel groups who accuse New Delhi of exploiting the area's natural resource wealth.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SARAJEVO, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Although moderates appear to have gained some ground in Bosnia's third post-war elections over the weekend, which analysts say is encouraging, nationalists prove to be still the leading force in the Balkans country. "The triumph of nationalist parties had been expected, especially since the campaign has been dominated by major ethnic rather than local issues," political analyst Emir Habul told AFP. "The relative success of moderates in such an atmosphere is an encouraging sign for democracy." Partial results from 46 of the 142 municipalities showed that three powerful nationalist parties that instigated the 1992-95 war -- the Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA), the Croat Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) -- were ahead of the pack. The results were based on less than 50 percent of the votes counted in Saturday's local polls to elect councillors in 142 municipalities and 140 mayors. The latter were, for the first time, elected directly in one round. More complete results were due to be announced late on Sunday. The major surprise of the vote was the strong showing of the moderate Union of Independent Social Democrats in Bosnia's Serb-run part. The party dealt a serious blow to the ruling SDS -- founded by fugitive war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic -- in Bosnia's biggest Serb-run city of Banja Luka, the electoral commission said. But even more surprisingly it appeared to have won in some municipalities of the traditionally hardline eastern parts of Republika Srpska. The Serb-run Republika Srpska along with the Muslim-Croat Federation makes up Bosnia after the 1992-95 war. The two entities are linked by weak central institutions. "One must not forget recent actions by the international community against the SDS. they (SDS) expected to gain from it, but it was the story of their corruption that attracted a lot of attention," Habul said. The top international representative in Bosnia, Paddy Ashdown, in June dismissed 60 Bosnian Serb officials, mostly SDS members, accused of aiding war crimes fugitives including Karadzic. He also ordered an audit of the SDS which revealed that the party was prone to corruption and tax evasion and had links to the criminal underworld. The moderate Union of Independent Social Democrats "sometimes flirted with the nationalists' agenda, but they knew that the corruption of the authorities is what ordinary people care about the most so it was the focus of their campaign," Senad Slatina of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told AFP. "We expected the low turnout to help nationalists, but the big story appears to be the surprise success of the moderates in some of the most unusual places." Turnout was 45.52 percent, the lowest registered in any post-war election so far, reflecting widespread apathy among the 2.3 milliso won in most municipalities, although moderates gained control in major Muslim-dominated cities including Sarajevo and made a strong showing in Banja Luka.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[French police arrested 17 people and discovered a cache of heavy weapons during raids in southwestern France on Sunday that targeted suspected members of Spain's armed Basque separatist group ETA, officials said. The interior ministry said heavy weapons, documents and large sums of cash had been discovered. It said the suspects included "two Spanish fugitives sought for several years who held senior responsibilities in the movement". Around 140 specialist officers, including members of France's anti-terrorist brigade and intelligence services, swooped on properties in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques region of the country which borders the Spanish Basque Country. An anti-terrorist investigating magistrate, Laurence Le Vert, arrived in the town of Urrugne in the region Sunday to oversee ongoing searches. A Spanish official said a Spanish truckdriver had been arrested on Sunday in Burgos, in central Spain, as part of the operation, adding that the man's wife was among those arrested in France. ETA has been blamed for the deaths of more than 800 people in a violent 36-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland comprising parts of northern Spain and southwestern France. It has been weakened in recent years by repeated raids in France and Spain and its political wing, Batasuna, has been banned in Spain. But last year it announced that Spain's economy, and in particular the tourist industry, had become a priority target and there were a spate of small bomb attacks in August in coastal resorts in northern Spain, enied any involvement and evidence soon emerged to indicate the atrocity had been the work of extremists believed to be linked to Al-Qaeda.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A deaf-mute Palestinian man became the latest victim of Israel's offensive in the northern Gaza Strip, bringing to four the number of Palestinians killed Sunday. Raed Abu Wadi, 36, died after being hit by a bullet in the head in the eastern sector of the Jabaliya camp, the centre of the Israeli operations, they said. The army had no immediate comment on the shooting, which brings to 63 the number of people killed since the start of a massive Israeli operation in the are late Tuesday, including 60 Palestinians and three Israelis, two of them soldiers. It also raised to 4,416 the overall death toll since the outbreak of the intifada or uprising against Israeli occupation in September 2000, including 3,392 Palestinians and 953 Israelis. Earlier, three Palestinian militants were killed by Israeli fire in the impoverished Jabaliya refugee camp, security sources said. One was killed when an Israeli tank shell struck him near a school. His identity was not immediately clear, but witnesses said he belonged to the Al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the radical Islamic Jihad movement. An army spokeswoman said troops had opened fire towards the man as he was preparing to launch a missile. "He was part of a group of several men who were about to launch an anti-tank missile," she told AFP, saying troops had registered a "hit". Shortly before dawn, another two activists from the Al Quds Brigades were killed by an Israeli rocket fired in the camp, Palestinian medical and security sources said. The spokeswoman said soldiers had spotted a group of gunmen trying to booby-trap a road in the camp. "Two terrorists from Islamic Jihad were seen trying to plant an explosive device. The force opened fire and killed them," she said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Fourteen people were killed and five injured Sunday in an explosion at a fireworks factory in Thailand's ancient capital Ayuthaya, officials and witnesses said. The blast destroyed the factory that officials revealed had not had a licence to produce fireworks for 10 years and police blamed "carelessness" for the blast. All the dead and injured were from the Boon-Leur factory in Ayuthaya, just north of the Thai capital Bangkok, but the blast at 3:00 pm (0800 GMT) also damaged nearby houses, according to officials and witnesses. "What we do know is this factory's license ran out 10 years ago and it was illegally producing fireworks," Kamnueng Isaro, a district official, told state radio. Prasith Thotawin, who lived nearby, said he rushed to the site when he heard the loud blast and help comfort the injured, according to the online news outlet Manager. The man said he had found four youths aged between 13 and 15 with severe skin burns and helped them get to a nearby hospital. Police said they suspected the accident may have been the result of increased fireworks production at the factory to complete orders ahead of the kingdom's Loi Krathong festival. Letting off fireworks is a key part of Loi Krathong, which falls on November 26 this year and is one of Thailand's largest festivals celebrated by people all over the country. Bangkok's municipal authority has been working to have fireworks banned from the festival in the capital, citing them as a danger to people's lives. Ayuthaya police spokesman Wanchai Tanadkit said the blast destroyed the 200 square-metre building housing the fireworks operation. "I believe it was most likely carelessness which caused this explosion," he said, adding it had also damaged houses about 200 metres (yards) away from the factory. Wanchai said an investigation would be conducted into the cause of the blast and police had secured the site. "The accident site is now under control. and casualties have been taken to Phranakhon Riaythayo and Phra Sangaraja hospitals," said Wanchai, adding the factory owner's wife was among the injured. He said no one outside the factory had been injured by the blast, and did not say whether the owner, Boon-Leur Imsuwan, would be charged over the blast.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei said Sunday he wants South Korea to come clean about past unauthorized nuclear experiments and not to repeat its mistake. ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), arrived in South Korea as his agency was investigating Seoul's secret experiments with potential ingredients for atomic bombs. "Any undeclared activities is a matter of serious concern for me," said ElBaradei who flew in Seoul to attend a conference. "We just wanted to make sure these were experiments and that there were nothing more than these experiments. (and that) these experiments will not be repeated again without being declared to the organization." But he warned against any hasty judgement on South Korea. "You cannot speculate on the issue before we have a comprehensive report on these experiments," he said. IAEA inspectors last month visited the country to investigate Seoul's shock revelations of past secret experiments with plutonium and enriched uranium which can be used for nuclear bombs. South Korea disclosed in September that its scientists secretly enriched a tiny amount of plutonium in 1982 and uranium in 2000. Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon reiterated Sunday the lab experiments had been purely for scientific purposes, not linked to nuclear weapons programs. "I expect a fair and objective conclusion based on facts to be presented before the board of governors on November 25," Ban told ElBaradei at a meeting late Sunday. ElBaradei is to hold a series of meetings with other top South Korean leaders, including Prime Minister Lee Hae-Chan on Monday and Unification Minister Chung Dong-Young on Tuesday. The case has embarrassed the United States and South Korea when they are trying, through six-party talks, to pressure Stalinist North Korea to end its nuclear weapons drive. The North has refused to take part in a fourth round of the multilateral talks, blaming what it calls hostile US policy and the secret nuclear experiments. ElBaradei, who is being tipped as a possible Nobel Peace Prize winner, travels Wednesday to Japan. The prizewinner is to be announced on Friday in Oslo. Observers have said they expect the Nobel committee this year to hail efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Anger, confusion in France over failed mission to free journalists in Iraq by Marc Burleigh.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[French media and authorities expressed anger on the weekend at an unofficial mission to free two French journalists taken hostage in Iraq more than six weeks ago which came up empty-handed after promising imminent success. The operation, headed by a French parliamentary deputy in President Jacques Chirac's ruling UMP party, has sown confusion and raised many questions over government efforts -- in public and in secret -- to free the two men, Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France International, who were captured south of Baghdad on August 20 along with their Syrian driver. Sunday's newspapers were especially scathing. Weekly Le Journal du Dimanche spoke of an "imbroglio" that was made up of "false leads, lies and confusion", while Le Monde's Sunday-Monday edition said: "The contradictions, which give 'Operation Julia' an aura that could be judged ridiculous if it were not a matter of life and death, are legion." Chirac on Saturday slammed the unofficial mission as "interference" while his foreign minister, Michel Barnier, said: "I want to hope that the parallel steps undertaken by a group in Iraq will not have consequences for the safety (of the men) and that they will not delay the moment of their release." Barnier added darkly: "The moment will come for answers to be given to what has happened." Newspapers were contemptuous of the mission's instigators. They are Didier Julia, the 70-year-old UMP deputy who is vice president of an Iraqi-French Friendship Group and an Arabic speaker with ties to the Middle East; and his field man, a 45-year-old former French navy commando named Philippe Brett who belongs to an association that used to have links to Saddam Hussein's regime. Both Julia and Brett had claimed on Friday that they were within hours of securing the release of the reporters. Brett, in a mobile telephone interview with French radio station Europe 1, had even asserted that he was with the two men but did not pass the handset to either of them. Julia later told journalists in the Syrian capital Damascus that a convoy meant to take the hostages out of Iraq had turned back before reaching the Syrian border because the US military had opened fire on it. US officials flatly denied the charge. Doubts were also raised over whether Brett was actually in Iraq. Julia said he met his associate in a Damascus hotel room before dawn on Saturday, despite the fact that the border is closed at night. Julia left Damascus on Sunday and was believed to be heading back to Paris via Lebanon. Asked about his inconsistent assertions and his failed initiative, he told reporters: "My mission as a deputy is never finished." French media, much of which has been publishing a daily vigil for the hostage journalists, took aim at Julia's supposed operation -- but also at the seemingJean-Francois Girault, had held a long meeting with Julia early on Friday, before the deputy affirmed that the hostages would soon be freed. "We are also asking ourselves what the secret services of the (French) republic have been doing for more than 40 days now." it said. Le Journal du Dimanche speculated that Julia had been manipulated by the Syrian intelligence services as part of a plot by Damascus to punish France for backing a United Nations resolution condemning Syrian involvement in Lebanon.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Election violence escalating in south Afghanistan: UN.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[KABUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Violence and intimidation have escalated in the south of Afghanistan ahead of landmark presidential elections on October 9, a United Nations report said Sunday. Supporters of the ousted hardline Islamic Taliban regime and other anti-government forces have been increasingly targeting civilians and government officials, the report said. It was issued jointly by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. The report said that since the end of the voter registration process on August 20, "the number of election-related incidents of violence has generally diminished. "However, violence and intimidation tactics carried out by the Taliban and other anti-government forces have escalated in the south. "They have been increasingly targeting civilians and government officials. "In the last month they have created a climate of fear by confiscating voter registration cards of entire villages and warning people not to participate in the upcoming elections." The document lists several incidents of violence, including the reported beheading of 10 tribal elders from Arghandab district in Zabul province who were seen to be supporting the government and the election process. In the southeast province of Khost, members of the Terezay tribe were warned by a tribal leader in a local radio broadcast to vote for incumbent President Hamid Karzai or have their houses burnt down. The report said that in other parts of the country, particularly in the east, northeast, north and central area, violence and intimidation were used by "factional authorities", or warlords. It said violence and threats remain "a major concern" in efforts to run a free and fair election. "Every effort should be made by the national security agencies and the international forces in order to strengthen security in areas of the country where extremist forces are putting pressure on the communities to stay away from the election." Some 18,500 US-led troops remain in the country after invading in late 2001 following the Taliban's refusal to surrender Osama bin Laden following the September 11 terror attacks. They are supported by around 9,000 NATO troops responsible for security in the capital Kabul and in the northern provinces.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GENEVA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[European football's governing body UEFA has given the Austrian and Swiss football federations until the end of the year to clear up shortcomings in their organisation of the tournament, a Swiss newspaper reported Sunday. UEFA's top officials wrote to both federations to warn them that rival bids which lost out in the race to host Euro 2008 could challenge the decision to award it to Austria and Switzerland, Sonntagszeitung said. The governing body reportedly said it had not been informed about alternative arrangements after plans for one of the eight stadiums in the Swiss city of Zurich fell through last month and demanded a response by December 31. It also called on the two federations to come up with signed contracts with the other stadia by the end of November and criticised an apparent lack of political backing for the project in the two countries. The amounts of money set aside for security in the project, notably in Switzerland, were regarded as inadequate, and other financial arrangements needed to be cleared up, according to the letter. UEFA could not be contacted about the report Sunday, which carried a picture of the faxed letterhead and quoted extracts. "We are taking this letter very seriously," Swiss football federation (ASF) president Ralph Zloczower saiars Christer Olsson added that he remained "fully confident the Local Organising Committee will run a successful tournament even though seven stadiums may be used instead of the eight initially planned". Officials have pointed out that many European countries have adequate infrastructure in place and can step in to organise its top tournament at relatively short notice.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SUKHUMI, Georgia, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia voted for its first new leader in a decade Sunday, amid simmering tension between the separatist regime here and the central government in Tbilisi. The tough-talking new Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has vowed to restore central rule over Abkhazia, but many fear he could be on a collision course with Abkhazia's rulers -- and with neighbouring Russia, which has given tacit backing to the separatist regime. The man widely seen as favourite to win Sunday's vote was 46-year-old Raul Khajimba, currently Abkhazia's prime minister. He is seen as a pro-Russian who will fiercely defend his region's autonomy. "We were in Georgia once and we do not want to go back to that," Khajimba said as he cast his ballot at school No.4 in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi. "Whoever wins the election, Abkhazia's path will be that of an independent state. Our policy of moving closer to Russia will (also) stay the same." In the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, there was condemnation of an election in which ballot papers were printed in Russian and Abkhaz, but not Georgian, even though the region is still internationally recognized as part of the former Soviet republic. "Of course we, along with the whole of the international community, do not recognise the legitimacy of these elections," Georgia's Security Minister Vano Merabishvili said late Saturday. But he added: "We do not intend to interfere in any way, unless pressure is put on (ethnic Georgians living in Abkhazia). We are absolutely ready to defend our citizens if need be." Sunday's poll was the first properly contested leadership election held in Abkhazia since it shook off Tbilisi's rule in a war in the early 1990s. That conflict left some 10,000 people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands of refugees, the majority of them ethnic Georgians who fled Abkhazia. There are fears that the three-way spat between Tbilisi, Moscow and Sukhumi could again erupt into violence, destabilizing a Caucasus region which is soon to be a strategic gateway for oil exports from the Caspian Sea to Western markets. The row over Abkhazia's status was rekindled after Saakashvili, a US-educated lawyer, was swept to power in Georgia last year in a dramatic bloodless revolution. He has said he will not rest until Georgia's separatist regions -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- are back under Tbilisi's control. This summer he announced Georgian warships would sink any vessels carrying tourists from Russia to resorts in Abkhazia, provoking a furious response from Moscow. Sunday's vote was called to choose a replacement for Vladislav Ardzinba, the man who led Abkhazia's war of secession but who for the last several years has been incapactiated by serious illness. A f There were some accusations Sunday from the opposition camp that Khajimba's supporters were pressuring voters into supporting their candidate. But Sergei Smyr, chairman of the election commission said that "there have been no problems. Everything has been going calmly and the voters are being very active."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Qualifier Na Li became the first Chinese woman to win a WTA singles title in Guangzhou on Sunday as she downed Martina Sucha of Slovakia in straight sets. Li defeated the more experienced Sucha 6-3, 6-4, showing the form that has seen her impress at home at the lower levels of the game, winning three ITF titles in China this season on her way to a 43-2 record. "I was nervous out there at the beginning and eager to win for the crowd," said the 22-year-old from Wuhan city in central China. "I didn't start too well because of this, but when I settled down, I felt much better," she said. Li, who ranked a career-high 123 four years ago, was world number 145 going into the event held in this southern Chinese city. At the China Open in Beijing two weeks ago, where Li also had to qualify for the main draw, she held match points against US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova before succumbing in a third-set tiebreak. Sucha, 23, a winner in Hobart two years ago, was unseeded in the 170,000-dollar tournament and ranks 91 in the world. "I was feeling a little tired and was slow, slower than I should have been," the Slovak said. "She was moving faster and deserved to win," Sucha added. Although Li said she was happy with her victory she played down Sunday's milestone and said she had bigger fish to fry. "I'm not concentrating too much on being the first WTA tour (tournament) Chinese champion," Li said. "My goal is to break into the top 100 and once I've achieved that, to break into the top 50."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[VATICAN CITY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified the last Austro-Hungarian emperor, Charles I, who is remembered in Austria for authorising the use of mustard gas during World War I. The move brings the Habsburg monarch one step from sainthood. "I hope Emperor Charles will serve as an example, especially for those with political responsibilities in Europe today," the pope said during an open-air ceremony in Saint Peter's Square that was attended by 30,000 worshippers, including around 1,000 members of the Habsburg dynasty. Also beatified was German mystic Anna Katharina Emmerick whose visions inspired Mel Gibson's controversial film "The Passion of the Christ." The pope, who is 84 and suffers from Parkinson's disease and other ailments, also conferred the status of "blessed", the penultimate step to full sainthood, on two Frenchmen and an Italian nun. Charles I became heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian empire on June 28, 1914 following the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, which historians say was the spark that ignited World War I. He was made emperor in November 1916 and crowned apostolic King of Hungary a month later. His beatification has caused controversy in Austria, where he is remembered for giving the go-ahead for the use of deadly mustard gas during World War I. Critics there believe his elevation to be politically driven by the conservative right. The Austrian press has ridiculed not only Charles' political record but the miracle he allegedly produced to merit beatification. According to the Vatican, he cured a Brazilian nun of varicose veins after doctors had given up all hope for her. His official biography, published by the Vatican, says he was committed to peace and was the only political leader to support pope Benedict XV's peace efforts. About 30,000 people gathered for the ceremony, among them some 700 descendants of the Habsburg family, including Charles I's four surviving sons of the 10 children he fathered with his wife Zita of Bourbon-Parma. Pride of place went to 91-year-old Otto von Habsburg, his eldest son and a former European Parliament deputy who renounced all claim to the throne in 1961. Belgium's Queen Dowager Fabiola led several European royal families attending the ceremony, including those of Spain, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. Anna Katharina Emmerick was born into a farming community in 1774, joined a convent and became famous for bearing the stigmata -- the wounds to hands and feet suffered by Christ during crucifixion -- after being confined to bed with a long illness. She died at the age of 50. She is revered as a selfless worker in the biography provided by the Vatican, which says "she was always willing to take on hard work and loathsome tasks". The poet Clemens Brentano became an admirer and visited her sickbed to record her visions. He published these after her death in a book entitled "The Painful Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ" which inspired the actor and director Mel Gibson to make his film. During the 26 years of his pontificate to date, John Paul II has formally recognized 1,342 religious figures as blessed, and canonised a total of 482 saints, more than any of his predecessors in the 2,000-year history of the Church.]]></c>

But instead, the party which governed for 18 consecutive years from 1979 under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, and also counts Sir Winston Churchill among its 20th Century premiers, faces an almost inevitable third consecutive defeat in a general election expected next year. Blair, who beat Major to take power in 1997, has also subsequently seen off two more Conservative leaders, William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith, while Howard's position is seen as increasingly under threat. With the staunchly eurosceptic message of UKIP eating away at traditional Conservative support, some pundits have predicted that the party could soon be supplanted by the Liberal Democrats as the main opposition to Labour. While dismissing this, Howard admitted Sunday that his party faced a tough task.

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An eight-year-old girl from northern Thailand on Sunday become the kingdom's fourth confirmed human case of bird flu since the start of the latest outbreak, the Thai health ministry said. The girl, from Petchabun province, was taken to hospital with a fever last week after eight of the family's chickens died. Initial tests showed negative for the lethal H5N1 form of the disease which has killed at least 10 people in Thailand and 19 in Vietnam this year. "The laboratory result, which was tested twice, confirmed that the girl is infected with H5N1 strain of bird flu virus," the health ministry said in a statement. Bird flu outbreaks have increased to affect 35 of Thailand's 76 provinces since the start of July to October 1, according to government figures. The health ministry said more than 190 people had been listed as suspected cases since July, when the second wave of cases started after a lull of several months, but virtually all had been cleared after tests. Three people have died in Thailand since July from either confirmed or probable bird flu including a mother and daughter last month in the country's first probable case of human-to-human infection. The case raised concerns the disease had mutated into a more contagious and lethal form that could trigger a global pandemic, although officials said that appeared not to be the case. However, tests continue in the United States and Thailand. A mutated bird flu outbreak was blamed for the deaths of as many as 40 million people worldwide in 1918. The scare led to intensified efforts in Thailand to try to stamp out the disease with the government promising a reform of poultry farming methods and nearly a million volunteers scoured the country for signs of the disease. Thailand was one of the world's largest exporters before the bird flu crisis hit.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Seal-hunting Norwegians to let tourists in on the act.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[OSLO, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Shooting at seals in the open sea may not be everyone's idea of a great holiday, but Norway's budding tourist industry bets that foreign visitors may just acquire the taste, despite criticism of "barbarism". Norway is always on the lookout for new ideas to attract visitors, even more so since the recent theft of artist Edvard Munch's emblematic painting "Scream" deprived the country of a great magnet for foreign tourists. Shrugging off scathing criticism from environmental organizations, Norway has decided to permit tour operators to ferry in seal hunters from Britain, Germany and elsewhere, starting in January. "The idea is not to step up seal hunting, or render the species extinct. All we're doing is allowing foreigners to take part," Norwegian Fisheries Minister Svein Ludvigsen told AFP. The Norwegian government considers seals a nuisance for the country's fishing industry, and has fixed a quota of 2,100 authorized killings per year, a quota which local hunters have not been able to meet. "The seals are a real threat to the fishing industry," Ludvigsen said. "Their presence in the fjords or along the coast frightens the fish, and often they get caught in fishing nets and destroy them." The killing sprees will only be open to bona fide hunters, who have to follow strict rules within the framework set by specialised tour operators. But animal rights activists have little patience with the idea, saying that tourists are more likely to be frightened than attracted by this past-time. "Norway could be labelled a barbaric nation," said Greenpeace official Truls Gulowsen. Animal-rights activists already point the finger at Norway for being the only nation to allow commercial whale-harpooning, and the country will never live down the international outcry produced by images of blood-soaked baby-seals, bludgeoned to death for their soft fur on its coastline. "It is ridiculous to import foreign help to do something that Norwegian fishers themselves don't bother doing," thundered Rasmus Hansson, head of the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) Norwegian section. The furry sea creatures may be a nuisance, but they have a right to co-exist with Norway's fishermen, he told AFP. "There have always been seals along the Norwegian coast. They are part of nature. We can't just go around killing whatever it is we don't like about nature," he said. Hansson also believes that the killing quotas are far too high, given that Norway has just 10,000 Harbour seals and 5,500 grey seals, according to the WWF. "In Great Britain there are 100,000 Harbour seals, and over there, they are protected," he said. In the tourism industry itself opinions are divided, with public-sector body Innovasjon Norge, which promotes the country's image abroad, stating that seal-hunting will just get a low profile in its tourism promotion efforts. "We do not wish to allow much room for this in our marketing activities," said Per-Arne Tuftin, head of Innovasjon Norge's communications department. "This thing could be counter-productive in terms of our tourism image." Throughout Scandinavia, seal fur is used to make vests, shoes or bags, and especially appreciated for being completely waterproof.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TEHRAN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Iran's most powerful legislative body has decided to remove constitutional barriers to large-scale privatisations in an effort to shake up the lumbering state-dominated economy, press reports said Sunday. The Expediency Council, the Islamic republic's final arbiter of legislation, ruled that the reformist government could go ahead with privatising sectors of the economy protected by two articles in the constitution. "In order to bring about economic development and prevent further losses to the national economy, the government is authorised to cede large industries and those mentioned in Articles 43 and 44 of the constitution to the cooperative and private sectors," the Expediency Council said. The concerned sectors that had been protected by the post-1979 constitution are banking, transport, downstream oil and gas production, insurance, telecommunications and shipping. Article 43 of the Iranian constitution, put together after the 1979 Islamic revolution, stipulates "economic independence", the "prevention of foreign domination over the economy" and "the provision of basic necessities to all citizens". Article 44 refers to the sectors to remain under state control. It also includes radio and television, which was not referred to in the Expediency Council's ruling. The decision by the council, which is headed by former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a pragmatic conservative, gives a rare boost to the liberalising agenda of reformist President Mohammad Khatami. The privatisation drive is enshrined in Iran's fourth five-year economic plan (2005-2010), which has met stiff opposition in parliament since hardliners took control of the legislature in May. The five-year economic plan had been approved by deputies in the previous parliament, but was blocked by March 2005, and this month wants to sell off 570 million dollars of assets in heavy industry.]]></c>

Frenchman Loeb was second on Sunday and although his world title lead was cut to 26 points by Norwegian Solberg, he is still overwhelming favourite to wrap up his first world title with just three rounds left. It was Solberg's third win in a row having taken the honours in Great Britain and Japan last month and his win here was never in doubt as he went into the final day with a 1min 11sec lead over Loeb. By the end, he had extended his advantage to 2min 7.9secs over the Frenchman and 3:20.9 in front of Spain's Carlos Sainz who was third in another Citroen. Estonia's Markko Martin, driving a Ford Focus, had been pushing hard to unseat Sainz but he was forced to retire on the 16th stage with a broken turbo.

		<c><![CDATA[European bankers are sceptical about forecasts from the European Central Bank (ECB) of economic growth in the 12-member Eurozone, the German financial newspaper Handelsblatt reports in its Monday edition. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said last month that the bank expected the eurozone economy to grow by 1.8-2.8 percent, or a median of 2.3 percent, in 2005. But a poll of experts at Barclays Capital, BBVA, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Goldman Sachs, Hypo-Vereinsbank, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley puts predicted growth next year at 1.9 percent. According to Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital, the bank erred in its belief that the economic recovery was robust, the paper said. In July the banks were forecasting 2.1 percent average growth in 2005, a figure they revised downwards to 2 percent last month. The ECB and the banks do agree, however, that inflation next year is likely to run at 1.8 percent.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The family of British engineer Kenneth Bigley, held hostage in Iraq for more than two weeks, has asked Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi to help secure his release, they said on Sunday. Paul Bigley, the captive's brother, said he had telephoned Saif Kadhafi, one of the Libyan leader's sons, asking if Tripoli could intervene to win the 62-year-old's freedom. "Saif said he had heard about the situation and asked what he could do," Bigley told Britain's Press Association newswire. "I said: 'Why don't you give your dad a call.,' and he promised he would. "Not long afterwards I had a call from the Kadhafi Foundation in Libya, who have pledged to do all they can to help us. They said they would do their very, very best." Bigley and two US co-workers were kidnapped in Baghdad 18 days ago by the Islamic group Tawhid wal Jihad (Unity and Holy War), which is allegedly run by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a close ally of terror group al-Qaeda, His two colleagues were beheaded soon after they were captured and the Briton's family has fought a desperate battle to try and save him through publicity and the intervention of third parties. On Saturday, Paul Bigley said he was looking into reports in a Kuwaiti newspaper that Tawhid wal Jihad was preparing to pass the British hostage on to another Islamic group, who would ransom him. Al-Zarqawi hoped to "benefit politically and financially" from Bigley, the Al-Rai Al-Aam newspaper reported, citing unnamed "Islamic sources". "Politically, he wants to embarrass British Prime Minister Tony Blair for invading Iraq, and financially he wants to get a ransom for the release of Bigley," the paper said. The Bigley family would be willing to pay up, Paul Bigley said. "If this is the case we will have to buy him back, it is as simple as that," he said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Russia's Communists observe failed 1993 revolt (ADDS details, poll).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Their ranks thinning with the years, several hundred Communists unfurled red banners Sunday and marched through a chilly Moscow to mark the 11th anniversary of the day Boris Yeltsin used tanks to shell parliament, putting a bloody end to their hardline revolt. Aging Communists and teenage nationalists gathered under a statue of Lenin in southern Moscow before marching in unison on what is now the government building but what in 1993 served as Russia's post-Soviet parliament. The chamber was dominated by Communist and ultra-nationalist forces who wrestled for power with Yeltsin, as a dying superpower faced a constitutional crisis that the Russian president chose to resolve by shelling the building with tanks. Fighting across Moscow killed 148 people, according to the official toll, breathing a poisonous air into Russia's nascent democratic reforms. The way the anniversary is marked now has reflected the modern course of Russia's politics. It brought tens of thousands of people out on to the streets in the 1990s amid economic chaos, hyperinflation and frustration with Yeltsin's commitment to democracy but seeming inability to get the economy on course. Such public demonstrations steadily died down under the reign of President Vladimir Putin, and the police presence in front of the government building Sunday afternoon was greater than that of protesters, who only numbered in the dozens, but whose ranks were expected to grow. "We must wring the necks of the bourgeoisie," one elderly woman told Russian state television with a hint of a smile on her face, a familiar refrain at these rallies. In late September 1993, after Yeltsin signed a decree dissolving the Supreme Soviet -- as the legislature was then called -- the Communist-dominated parliament voted to remove the Russian leader and handed his powers to his vice president Alexander Rutskoi, who joined the opposition. Anti-Yeltsin protests began on October 2 and escalated the following day as parliament supporters barricaded themselves inside the White House and seized the neighboring Moscow mayor's office. And on October 3, a group of Communists broke through police barricades surrounding the White House to march on the Ostankino media tower that controlled post-Soviet airwaves and which at the time was allegiant to Yeltsin. A bloody night shootout followed at the media center, with pro-Yeltsin forces holding firm while news of events that were only a shooting distance were being read live by a tense newscaster. Dozens were believed to have been killed in the mayhem. Some 100 people laid wreaths at Ostankino on Sunday. On October 4, 1993, troops and tanks loyal to Yeltsin finally opened fire on the White House and by the next morning the rebellion had been crushed. A poll released by the respected Levada research institute this week said 58 percent of the respondents now felt that Yeltsin's decision to use force at the time was unjustified.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Mark Hughes says his penultimate match in charge of Wales will be an emotional occasion as his side plays England in a World Cup qualifier, the first game between the two countries in 20 years. Hughes will be Wales coach against England at Old Trafford on Saturday and then ends with a game away to Poland in Cardiff the following Wednesday before he returns full-time to his new duties at Blackburn Rovers. The two games will bring down the curtain on an impressive five years in charge of Wales and he admits that the England game will be his big chance to end with a flourish. "Everyone has been waiting for this game since the draw was made and we have not played each other for 20-odd years either - that adds to it," he said. "It will be a great occasion and a great event in many ways. Now it's upon us, so let's look forward to it. "I have great pride in being the Welsh manager. As a Welshman I have emotional ties to the job, so it was a massive decision I have made. But I think it was the right one and that everyone accepts that. "My aim is to make sure the team is in great shape for the rest of the campaign, and I'm sure they will be.'' Hughes ion and focus on the players who are trying to qualify for a major tournament for the first time since 1958. "At the end of the day, it's not about me. It's important that the squad do well and that everyone involved in the Welsh set-up enjoys these two games. "`We have come a long way in the five years I have been in charge, and whatever the outcome - and I hope it will be a positive one - I will look back and be proud of my work.'' There had been some confusion in the build-up to the match over when Manchester United would release Ryan Giggs, but Sir Alex Ferguson defused a brewing row with a phone call to his old striker. "People have tried to make an issue out of it, but it's not an issue as far as I'm concerned. Ryan will be with us on Tuesday, so it does not have an impact on our preparation.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[French President Jacques Chirac is to embark Tuesday on an Asian tour aimed at boosting economic ties -- and maybe his lifelong passion for Chinese art. The trip, comprising a stopover of several hours in Singapore and then two-day visits to Vietnam and China, will have the character of "a concerted offensive" to develop French investment in the most dynamic region in the world, Chirac's office said. Political relations with all three countries are solid, officials said, but the trade side of the equation is lagging. The Chinese leg of the tour, in the form of a state visit to Beijing October 9 and 10, will reflect the special importance Chirac places on Sino-French ties, and permit Chinese authorities to match the red-carpet treatment Chinese President Hu Jintao received when he visited Paris in January. France has made no secret that it views a partnership with China -- with whom it sits as a permanent member of the UN Security Council -- as key to forging a counterweight US geo-political dominance. In a cultural exchange designed to strengthen friendship in other areas, China is starting a Year of France event on the heels of a Year of China that ended in France in July. An unprecedented exhibition of 50 impressionist masterpieces by Monet, Renoir and other French artists is notably to open for a six-week run in Beijing on October 11 before moving to Shanghai and Hong Kong. Some 50 French industrialists will accompany Chirac on his trip, keen to seal deals in the offing worth billions of euros (dollars) and to stop French companies losing ground to US, Japanese and other competitors in the huge emerging economy. Two Chinese airlines, China Southern and Air China, are said to be considering signing a two-billion-euro (2.4-billion-dollar) purchase order of Airbus aircraft, while the troubled French group Alstomunrest in Kurdistan since the invasion.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ZAGREB, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Croatia's decision to create a protected fishing and ecological area off its Adriatic coast, which is exempting EU countries, became effective Sunday, amid protests by local fishermen who brand it as cosmetic. "For us the situation will remain as it has been," fishermen union leader Petar Baranovic told national radio. "Foreign fishermen, who have been fishing in this area until now and have devastated it, will be allowed to continue to do so." The creation of the zone was approved in October 2003 after Croatia dropped its original plan for an exclusive economic zone in the Adriatic Sea following strong protests by neighbouring Slovenia which complained that it would be left without direct access to international shipping waters. However, in June, ahead of a European Union summit in Brussels at which Zagreb was granted official candidate status for EU membership, the government decided to postpone the creation of the zone with regard to EU members. Creation of the area had been opposed by Italy and Slovenia. EU members will be exempted zone until Croatia and the 25-nation European Union reach an agreement on fishing rights. Croatian fishermen have been accusing the government of sacrificing their interests and warn that the fishing and ecological zone is necessary to protect stock in the Adriatic which they say is already being devastated by their Italian counterparts who have a far bigger fishing fleet. According to Croatian figures, Italy's annual catch amounts to some 200,000 tonnes of fish compared with Croatia's 20,000 tonnes. Slovenia has an annual catch of some 2,000 tonnes of fish. The zone, covering an area of some 57,000 square kilometres (22,800 square miles), will be patrolled by 90 boats, 16 ships, six planes, four helicopters and a drone, the tourism, transport and sea ministry said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TEHRAN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Iran's reformist Transport Minister Ahmad Khorram was hauled before the conservative-held parliament Sunday to defend his record or face impeachment over alleged corruption, carnage on the roads and the awarding of government contracts to foreign companies. He is the first minister in the reformist government of President Mohammad Khatami to face the sack from parliament, which fell into the hands of hardliners in February's elections. However the conservative speaker of the Majlis, Gholam Ali Hadad-Adel, said the move did not mean deputies were embarking on a purge of the moderate executive. "Whatever the decision of the Majlis, it does not mean that we do not want to work with this government," he said. As the impeachment hearing began, one conservative deputy, Ali Ahmadi, complained that in the current Iranian year, which began on March 20, road accidents were already up 24 percent. "Last year 25,350 people died on the roads, that is 5,600 more than three years ago," he said. "Between the (1979) revolution and three years ago, we had 148 plane accidents with 780 dead. Over the last three years, we have had 86 accidents with 212 killed." Khorram, who has the support of Khatami, took over the portfolio after fellow reformist Rahman Dadman died in a plane crash four years ago. Some 116 deputies signed the request for Khorram to be impeached, and along with road and air accidents have also pointed to alleged corruption in his ministry and his handling of Tehran's new but long-overdue airport. In the impeachment demand, Khorram was accused of "tarnishing the Islamic Republic of Iran's reputation" after he handed a 200-million dollar contract to Turkish-led consortium Tepe-Akfen-Vie (TAV). Tehran'd tension behind every debut," Ford told the Corriere della Sera at the weekend. "To have one of the world luxury brands on your shoulders is sometimes too heavy a burden," he said, generously paying tribute to his former assistant, who "passed the test and from now on everything will be easy." To judge by the collections this week, designers are beginning to tire of the 1950s-inspired ladylike trend and are turning to something a little more dangerous. Dolce & Gabbana, Gianfranco Ferre and Roberto Cavalli all heard the call of the wild this season. Animal skins, whether real or fake, abounded on the runways. All the big cats were out in force, but also the more esoteric zebra, ostrich and kangaroo, plus all the reptiles, python and crocodile in particular. Snakeskin and mock croc, dyed in every colour of the rainbow, turned up as trenchcoats at Trussardi, hot pants at Cavalli, and incorporated into couture-feel dresses at Jil Sander. Cavalli used leopard prints for billopion and kinetic prints, also very Sixties. Prada's never-ending quest for perfection is legendary, as is her reputation as a trend-setter and arbiter of taste. For Prada die-hards the only other designer who comes close is Consuelo Castiglioni at Marni, who for next summer experimented with rustic fabrics like hessian and string to extraordinary effect.]]></c>

The legal department of Iran's Cultural Heritage Organisation told AFP the case was the first in which the death penalty had been imposed here for antiquities trafficking. "We hope the executions will be carried out in Jiroft and put an end to the smuggling," the head of the judiciary in Kerman province, Gholam Hossein Heydari, told state television. The two men convicted were not identified, and the sentencing is subject to supreme court approval. Jiroft, in the southern province of Kerman, was the site of an ancient civilisation between the fourth and third millennia BC. The site was discovered by locals in early 2001 and subsequently badly looted. Executions here are usually carried out in cases of murder, armed robbery, rape, apostasy and serious drug trafficking. According to reports in Iran's main newspapers and other media monitored by AFP, at least 73 people have been executed in Iran since January 1.

Like he's done throughout the campaign, Federer followed the same script which has taken him to nine other trophies this season, including three of the four Grand Slams. Producing the rout took just 57 minutes, with Roddick accepting his fate for the eighth time in nine meetings with the superb Swiss. The loss was the third this season for Roddick against Federer, with all of them coming in finals (Wimbledon and Toronto). Federer's win gave him his 10th title of 2004 and he is now undefeated in the last dozen finals he played stretching back to October 2003, when he beat Carlos Moya in Vienna. With Sunday's triumph, he became only the third man in the history of tennis to win 12 finals in a row - the others were Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe more than two decades ago. "I didn't really think I could win 10 titles, you can't aim so high. I'm just hoping for a good end to the season," said a player now 69-6 on the year with four more events to play. "I never thought about reaching 10 titles in a season, it's difficult and I didn't have the expectation. I'm not going for records, I take it one tournament at a time." Federer out-aced Roddick, nailing 11 untouchable serves to eight for the American. The Swiss broke Roddick four times and saved both break points that he faced in the opening set. American second seed Roddick said he was troubled by an elbow tendon, admitting that even had he been 100 percent, taking out the on-form, four-time Grand Slam champion would have been a huge task. "I came out and gave it a shot," said the world number two. "But once I got broken (opening game of the second set) I didn't feel too good about my chances." But Roddick who played five matches in five days after jetting around the world from Davis Cup play in the United States last week, was pleased enough with his week. "I had no expectations. I got here and was dead tired. I was even asleep in my dressing room before the first match (Wednesday). "I felt exhausted. If you'd told me I'd get to the final before it all started, I would have said you were a little crazy."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Anger, confusion in France over failed mission to free journalists in Iraq.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[French media and authorities expressed anger Sunday at an unofficial mission to free two French journalists taken hostage in Iraq more than six weeks ago which came up empty-handed after promising imminent success. The operation, headed by a French parliamentary deputy in President Jacques Chirac's ruling UMP party, has sown confusion and raised many questions over government efforts -- in public and in secret -- to free the two men, Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France International, who were captured south of Baghdad on August 20 along with their Syrian driver. Government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope told Forum Radio J that the mission, "with no links whatsoever to the diplomatic action of our government, is deeply regrettable." He added: "This type of untimely initiative now has to stop." Chirac on Saturday slammed the unofficial mission as "interference" while his foreign minister, Michel Barnier, said: "I want to hope that the parallel steps undertaken by a group in Iraq will not have consequences for the safety (of the men) and that they will not delay the moment of their release." Barnier added darkly: "The moment will come for answers to be given to what has happened." Newspapers were contemptuous of the mission's instigators: Didier Julia, a 70-year-old UMP deputy who is vice president of an Iraqi-French Friendship Group and an Arabic speaker with ties to the Middle East; and his field man, a 45-year-old former French navy commando named Philippe Brett who belongs to an association that used to have links to ousted Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. The weekly Journal du Dimanche spoke of an "imbroglio" that was made up of "false leads, lies and confusion", while the daily newspaper Le Monde wrote that the contradictions "give 'Operation Julia' an aura that could be judged ridiculous if it were not a matter of life and death." Both Julia and Brett had claimed on Friday that they were within hours of securing the release of the reporters. Brett, in a mobile telephone interview with French radio station Europe 1, had even asserted that he was with the two men but did not pass the handset to either of them. Julia, in the Syrian capital Damascus, later told journalists that a convoy meant to take the hostages out of Iraq had turned back before reaching the Syrian border because the US military had opened fire on it. US officials flatly denied the charge. Doubts were raised over whether Brett was actually in Iraq. Julia said he met his associate in a Damascus hotel room before dawn on Saturday, despite the fact that the border is closed at night. Julia left Damascus Sunday and was believed to be heading back to Paris via Lebanon. Asked about his inconsistent assertions and his failed initiative, he told reporters: "My mission as a deputy is never finished." French media, many of which have been publishing a daily vigil for the hostage journalists, were scathing of Julia's supposed operation -- but also at the seeming "impotence" of the government. They additionally highlighted curious developments that suggested Julia may have had a measure of official support. Chief among those was the reported involvement of Laurent Gbagbo, the president of the former French colony of Ivory Coast. Gbagbo's plane was used to transport Julia to Baghdad on September 5, Le Monde reported. Another newspaper, Le Telegramme de Brest, said the plane was again used to fly a Moroccan man carrying a ransom to Amman. Le Monde said, according to undisclosed sources in Paris, Brett had been a go-between for arms shipments to Ivory Coast, where a civil war broke out two years ago. It also reported that France's ambassador to Syria, Jean-Francois Girault, held a long meeting with Julia early Friday, before the deputy affirmed that the hostages would soon be freed. Le Journal du Dimanche speculated that Julia had been manipulated by the Syrian intelligence services as part of a plot by Damascus to punish France for backing a UN resolution condemning Syrian involvement in Lebanon.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bulldogs come from behind to win gripping NRL grand final by Robert Smith.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Canterbury Bulldogs put behind a troubled season to come from behind and claim a gripping 16-13 victory over the Sydney Roosters in Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) grand final in front of over 80,000 fans here on Sunday. The Bulldogs trailed 13-6 at halftime but scored twice early in the second half to storm to a 16-13 lead and hold out a desperate Roosters side to claim their eighth title. It was the first time in 19 matches this season that the Roosters had lost after leading at halftime. The Bulldogs were inspired by their big forwards Willie Mason and Mark O'Meley and appeared to have played their way to a commanding position midway through the second half only to tire, allowing the Roosters to hit back and almost pinch the title in the final frenetic minutes. "It's the best day of my life. These are my best mates. I love every one of them. I can't believe it. There's nothing better than this," Mason said. "It's been an unreal year for the Bulldogs. To my teammates we have been through hell this year and this is what it's all about. It's unreal. I love you all. This just erases everything." Desperate defence held the Canterbury line intact and they have now won 16 of their last 21 games against the Roosters. It was the Roosters' third consecutive grand final but of those they only won once over the New Zealand Warriors in 2002 and lost in last year's decider to Penrith Panthers. Canterbury claimed their first title since 1995 and were playing in only their second grand final since then. The club didn't endear themselves was Canterbury who drew level after a 24th-minute try by New Zealand Test winger Matt Utai and a penalty goal to winger Hazem El Masri. But the Roosters seized the initiative late in the half with scrum-half Brett Finch potting a 34th-minute drop goal and Test fullback Anthony Minichiello dashing over to score under the crossbar after a break by substitute Anthony Tupou five minutes from halftime. The Bulldogs came out the better in the second half before 82,127 fans at the Olympic stadium with Utai scoring his second try after a clever switch of play to the short side four minutes after the resumption. El Masri, the NRL's leading point-scorer this season, scored his 100th try for his club to put the Bulldogs into the lead for the first time 16-13 after 53 minutes. Canterbury looked to be gaining ascendancy but flagged in the last 15 minutes and the Roosters came more into the game, only thwarted by dropped passes and last-ditch tackles. Australia will this wfy the victims, but that at least seven were men and three were women. Thai television showed images of a completely flattened building amid fields littered with charred debris from what appeared to have been an enormous explosion. "What we do know is this factory's license ran out 10 years ago and it was illegally producing fireworks," Kamnueng Isaro, a district official, told state radio. Prasith Thotawin, who lived nearby, said he rushed to the site when he heard the loud blast and help comfort the injured, according to the online news outlet Manager. The man said he had found four youths aged between 13 and 15 with severe skin burns and helped them get to a nearby hospital. The factory had moved to its most recent site from across the road a decade ago after the original building was also destroyed in a similar accident, said Ayuthaya's deputy director of Industrial Works, Prasert Tapineeyanguru. He said the owner of the factory, Boon-Leur Imsuwan, could factory. Wanchai said an investigation would be conducted into the cause of the blast and police had secured the site. "The accident site is now under control. and casualties have been taken to Phranakhon Riaythayo and Phra Sangaraja hospitals," said Wanchai, adding the factory owner's wife was among the injured. He said no one outside the factory had been injured by the blast.]]></c>

The latest deaths brought to three the toll from the operation, backed up with air cover, near the rural Kutuderesi region in the province of Tunceli. Soldiers were continuing to comb the area for members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), now also known as KONGRA-GEL, the agency added. The PKK picked up arms against Ankara in 1984 for Kurdish self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast, then announced a unilateral ceasefire in 1999 for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. But, the rebels ended the truce in June, warning tourists and investors to stay away from the country.

"I haven't talked recently to Michael. I hope he will take part in Real's game against Deportivo La Coruna tonight. Then we will have three strikers - (Wayne) Rooney, (Jermain) Defoe and Owen." However, Eriksson admits he could find it difficult to select the former Liverpool striker if he never plays for Real. "Owen said he was concerned, and I as his manager am concerned as well.

		<d><![CDATA[RAMALLAH, West Bank, Oct 2 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Members of the Palestinian parliament were holding an emergency session here on Sunday in a bid to discuss the escalating crisis in the northern Gaza Strip, where the Israeli army is pressing a five day raid which has left over 60 people dead. "The session will focus only on the Israeli attack in Gaza," Hassan Khreishe, deputy speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), told AFP before the meeting started. "We are trying to find ways of helping the people under attack." Council speaker Rawhi Fatouh called for international observers to be dispatched immediately to the war-torn area. "We call on the International Parliamentary Union and the Arab Parliamentary Union to send delegations to Palestine to see the situation on the ground and to put pressure on their governments to intervene and stop this Israeli agression," he told reporters in Ramallah. MPs were expected to issue a statement calling for immediate international intervention in Gaza, which would be sent to governments across the globe, parliamentary sources said. The emergency session was being held a day after the Palestinian cabinet declared a state of emergency over the Israeli operation, with Yasser Arafat appealing for international help against the "criminal and racist" Israeli campaign. Khreishe said the parliment was also set to consider a proposal to give up one day's salary for victims of the ongoing Israeli operation. "We are considering the declaration of a full working day in support of those affected," he said, explaining the proceeds would be earmarked for the residents of northern Gaza. "This is much better than going on strike and shutting down." It was not immediately clear how the proposal would work, nor how much money would be involved, but Khreishe said the concept would be extended to everyone living in the Palestinian territories. On Saturday, shops closed across the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a widely observed strike in protest against the mounting toll of Palestinian victims.]]></c>

She will meet Libyan leader Colonel Moamer Kadhafi during her trip. "Loyola de Palacio will discuss with the Libyan authorities possible future cooperation between the EU and Libya in the energy and transport sectors both at a bilateral and a regional level," the comission said. The visit by de Palacio, Spain's representative on the commission, comes as the EU prepares to lift the embargo on the north African state it has been operating since 1986. Ambassadors from the EU's 25 member states recently called for a "global lifting" of the embargo, a proposal likely to be endorsed when EU foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg later this month. But an obstacle to complete normalisation of relations between the EU and Libya remains in the shape of the death sentences passed on five Bulgarian nurses accused of infecting children with the AIDS virus.

		<d><![CDATA[OLBIA, Italy, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Defending world champion Petter Solberg, driving a Subaru, won the Rally of Italy on Sunday to keep likely successor Sebastien Loeb of France waiting to confirm his place as 2004 champion. Frenchman Loeb was second on Sunday and although his world title lead was cut to 26 points by Norwegian Solberg, he is still overwhelming favourite to wrap up his first world title with just three rounds left. "I was really trying to concentrate on each stage, with all the rocks and stones, it was very exciting," said Solberg. "It was a difficult race for everybody, we needed a lot of energy. But it was a perfect weekend and everything worked well. I still have a little chance of winning the title but Sebastien is very close." Loeb said that he was determined not to take risks and thereby shatter his title chances. "It was difficult to catch Petter without taking risks," said the Frenchman. "I now need to score five more points in three rounds to win the title, while Petter needs to win all of them." It was Solberg's third win in a row having taken the honours in Great Britain and Japan last month and his win here was never in doubt as he went into the final day with a 1min 11sec lead over Loeb. By the end, he had extended his advantage to 2min 7.9secs over the Frenchman and 3:20.9 in front of Spain's Carlos Sainz who was third in another Citroen. Estonia's Markko Martin, driving a Ford Focus, had been pushing hard to unseat Sainz but he was forced to retire on the 16th stage with a broken turbo. With his win, Solberg has now reached five wins this season - the same as Loeb. The next round is in Corsica from October 15-17 before the 2004 season concludes in Spain (Oct 29-31) and Australia (Nov 12-14).]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[FALLUJAH, Iraq, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US warplanes pounded the Iraqi insurgent-held town of Fallujah on Sunday for a third time in just over 24 hours killing at least two people in an ongoing push to wrest hotspots from rebel hands ahead of January polls. The pre-dawn strike took place just hours after US and Iraqi officials said Samarra, another violence-wracked city, was largely under control after a military offensive that left some 150 people dead. It was one of the largest US-led operations aimed at crushing the insurgents since the April 2003 overthrow of president Saddam Hussein. But the rebels have continued to fight on, claiming daily victims. Iraqi national guards found the decapitated body of a man and the corpse of a woman who had been shot dead but their nationality was unknown, medics said on Sunday. A senior US military official warned that the militants' shock tactics, such as hostage beheadings, had the potential to backfire by uniting world opinion against them. The outskirts of Fallujah were smouldering again after US warplanes bombed a building where the military said between 10 and 15 insurgents suspected of links with Iraq's most wanted man Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi had been shifting weapons. "A large number of enemy fighters are presumed killed," the army said, without giving an exact toll. Medics in the town said two people had been killed and 10 wounded. The onslaught followed two earlier missions around the Sunni Arab enclave west of Baghdad, again targeting suspected Zarqawi hideouts. One on Friday left several women and children dead, according to hospital officials. has fuelled tensions in Kirkuk, which is also inhabited by Turkmen. On the political front, neighbouring Iran announced Sunday it intended to take part in a US-proposed international conference on election plans for Iraq scheduled to take place in Egypt next month. "In principle, taking part in the conference does not pose a problem for us," foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters, adding the Islamic republic "welcomes all initiatives that favour stability in Iraq." "The details on our participation will be announced later," he added.]]></c>

On that date in 1973, Egyptian and Syrian forces launched attacks against Israel as the country marked Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.

		<c><![CDATA[National security adviser Condoleezza Rice on Sunday strongly denied a report that the George W. Bush administration had been told that aluminum tubes in Iraq before the war were likely for conventional weapons -- not for a nuclear weapons program, as the White House long had asserted. "That is not accurate," Rice told NBC television's "Today Show" program about a report appearing in Sunday's New York Times, which reported that the Bush administration was made aware as early as 2001 that the aluminum tubes used as critical evidence to justify an invasion of Iraq were probably for intended for small artillery rockets. In the months after the September 11 attacks, as the administration built a case for confronting Iraq, Rice and other senior officials asserted that the tubes were evidence of a nuclear program, despite expert opinion to the contrary, the Times wrote. "She was aware of the differences of opinion," newspaper quotes a senior administration official saying about Rice. But Rice denied that Sunday. "At that time we understood there were some debates within the intelligence community. I later learned that the Energy Department believed that these tubes might be for something else," she said. "But in fact, the intelligence community assessment -- the judgment of the intelligence community as a whole as well as the very strong view of the director of central intelligence -- was that these tube were most likely for use in nuclear weapons," she said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KABUL, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Three years after the September 11 attacks on the United States changed the course of Afghanistan's history, the shattered nation this week begins a nervous countdown to unprecedented elections. With 27,000 foreign troops in the country, warlords running personal fiefs and Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden lurking in the shadows, a mostly illiterate electorate is preparing to cast a vote with global resonance. At stake is not only the presidency of this turbulent land, but the status of the US-led war on terrorism, which has sharply divided the world over the past three years. The war-weary men and women who leave their farms and villages for the 5,000 voting stations scattered through Afghanistan's wild landscape on October 9 will be playing a part in the bitter battle for the US presidency. A smooth election with an undisputed outcome -- neither of which is guaranteed -- will enable President George W. Bush to claim a victory for his much-maligned foreign policy and predict a similar outcome for Iraq. "It is likely the Americans will play it as a success and say it could be an example for Iraq, but there is a significant difference between the two," said Clive Williams, director of terrorism studies at the Australian National University. US-led forces are struggling against a growing and bloody insurgency in Iraq's cities, while in mostly-rural Afghanistan attacks have been sporadic and on a smaller scale despite pledges by militants to disrupt the vote. Some 18,500 US-led troops remain in the country after failing to capture or kill bin Laden, whose presence in Afghanistan was the reason for the invasion after the September 11 attacks on the US. They are supported by around 9,000 NATO troops responsible for security in the capita Turnbull. "Peter's candidacy could, indeed, hand Wentworth to the Labor Party." Howard, 65, is seeking a fourth term in office but his conservative government of Liberals in coalition with the rural-based National Party is fighting neck-and-neck in opinion polls with Labor and its new 43-year-old leader, Mark Latham. The coalition held 83 seats in the outgoing 150-member parliament to 63 for Labor, the rest being independents and members of smaller parties. Analysts say a loss of eight seats for Howard's coalition would see Labor take power with the backing of small parties.]]></c>

According to Stein Toennesson, head of the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO), ElBaradei and his UN atomic agency would be the perfect candidates, although he admitted that the uncertain outcome of the ongoing Iran nuclear conflict might hurt their chances. With a record 194 candidates to choose from this year, the Nobel Committee can pick up to three laureates to share the coveted award. Women writers, long overlooked by the Swedish Academy, could be well-placed to take home the Literature honours this year, observers said, citing Algeria's Assia Djebar, Joyce Carol Oates of the United States and Dane Inger Christensen as potential winners. The prize will be awarded either this Thursday or the Thursday after.

Alesentation. Macdonald was the third British designer to serve as artistic director at Givenchy after Galliano and McQueen.

Fresh off her success as costume designer for the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympic Games, she has forsaken London to strut her stuff in Paris. Also reportedly up for the Givenchy job are Roland Mouret, Zac Posen and Isaac Mizrahi.

The exhibition also looks at the varying professional use of bags across cultures, from the World War I nurse's kit to the Dogon tribal hunter's satchel to the Cameroon healer's bag. Fashion is not to be left out of the equation. Saillard explains that the more voluminous the clothes over the centuries, the less need there was for a bag as important items could be stashed in inner folds of fabric. In the Middle Ages, women carried their personal belongings in their billowing dresses. The advent of more transparent, form-fitting garments in the Empire period forced ladies to add a simple fabric bag to their ensembles. Over the years, some of fashion's most creative talents have integrated bags into their outfits, as with avant-garde Japanese designer Junya Watanabe's saddle bag dress with massive pockets. The second half of the exhibition is devoted to the decorative, more frivolous uses of bags, from Japanese fukusas -- knotted pieces of silk used to carry offerings -- to Christian Lacroix's beaded "monster" bags. "Bags often are evidence of social standing; the more decorative bags indicate a certain level of wealth," Saillard notes. Tracing the evolution of fashion handbags from the clutch purse of the 1920s to the minaudiere of the 1930s, the exhibition finally pays tribute to the iconic handbags of today, like the Hermes Kelly, named after Grace Kelly, or the Lady Dior, famous after it was seen on the arm of the late Princess Diana. "Carried Away" runs through February 20, 2005.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Two American light armoured cars lead the way, two more take up the rear, in the middle a truck is loaded with newly-trained Afghan soldiers: the mixed bag of troops are on patrol in Afghanistan's unruly south. At dawn one recent Sunday, at the gates of Kandahar, the biggest city in southern Afghanistan and the former headquarters of the Taliban, 15 US troops have an appointment with 22 young Afghan recruits from the fourth division of the new Afghan National Army. The mission: to patrol a zone of the old city that they have never visited before. Generally however "the situation is pretty quiet, there is some animosity but it does not manifest physically," Martinez said. Sometimes the Afghans act as intermediaries. On Sunday Lowe offered a bottle of water to a young girl. She refused. until he gave it to an Afghan soldier who gave it to her. Thanks to these ground reconnaissance trips, the US army can also more easily take the pulse of the people and carry out intelligence gathering alongside the patrols, according to Lowe. At the same time, they are a training mission: about 320 of these soldiers sent from the US national guard have been deployed in Afghanistan to instruct and build a strong Afghan army, considered crucial if the central government is to extend its authority into the provinces. "These troops, they are fearless. They are ready to die for their country," said Lowe. The Americans teach them "organisational skills," he explained. "We are trying to transform them from a guerrilla into a more modernized army." The United States soldiers ha arrested Sunday in raids by anti-terrorist police in southwestern France, officials said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Conservationists are preparing for key battles at a global wildlife summit in Bangkok as officials warn that the battle to save endangered species is being hampered by lumbering bureaucracy, unwilling governments and a cash crisis. Some 1,500 delegates gathered for the 13th meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) are set to debate 50 changes to the global treaty, including limits on trade in species such as the great white shark and Irawaddy dolphin. Others species include the Asian elephant, the tropical ramin tree used in pool cues and the reef-dwelling humphead wrasse -- consirhinos on his well-maintained bushveld farm in 1996 -- but he has since lost three of his black rhinos. A "cantankarous and very territorial" infertile bull named "Number 65" is taking the rap for killing two males and one female. Hume would rather that a hunter pay between 80,000 (64,500 euros) and 100,000 dollars to shoot "Number 65", who is a nuisance and who cannot breed, and use the funds in one of his "many other conservation projects that are screaming for money". "If you have a black rhino that is old and that is going to die anyway, why not let it be hunted," says Andre van Dyk, communications manager at the South African Hunters and Game Conservation Association. "The farmer can plough that money back into conservation." Apart from his black rhino project, Hume breeds disease-free buffaloes and is developing a vaccine for Roan Antelope to fight a life-threatening disease caused by ticks. He does not hunt himself and his employees do not carry rifles rked the run-up to landmark municipal elections, postponed from November to February, has been shattered by successive announcements by women of their intention to stand. Fatima al-Khreiji became the third woman to throw her hat in the ring even though it remains unclear whether women will have the right to participate in the first-ever nationwide ballot to elect half the members of 178 municipal councils. "I want to focus on single, divorced and widowed womens issues, their problems and needs. I want to help ordinary women, not the financially privileged," Khreiji told the Saudi daily Arab News this week. Khreiji, who works in special needs education, joined another two women -- Nadia Bakhurji and Fatin Bundagji -- in forming the vanguard of declared candidates for an election in which they might not even be allowed to vote. Bundagji, who heads the women's empowerment department in the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told AFP last month that she would stura (consultative) Council endorsing female participation in the ballot. "The (Saudi) woman is ready to participate in every kind of social work, including the municipal elections," Mohammad al-Zalfah told the audience. The anticipated election, to be held in three stages from February 10 through April 21, is part of a drive to introduce limited reforms, which Riyadh insists must be tailored to Saudi specifications and not necessarily follow a Western pattern.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Saudi women's rights activists may be well aware of the social constraints on improving their status in the ultra-conservative kingdom, but they are becoming increasingly vocal in demanding participation. The calm that had marked the run-up to landmark municipal n thundered from an unseen location. "We did not have the chance to participate. Workshops are led by men. Most papers are presented by men. What is the point of our presence here." the member of the National Human Rights Association (NHRA) asked angrily. But while some of the 100 male participants were busy answering their noisy mobile phones, dismissing Zain al-Abedin's comments, others gave her an approving round of applause. A paper prepared by writer Abdullah al-Ghezami stressed that securing a cultural role for women should start with a "man's admission that a woman knows as much as he does, and can do as much as he can". "She needs nothing more than the lifting of the (male) guardianship imposed on her, and let her look after herself," he said. Another seminar, held a few kilometres (a couple of miles) away from the intellectuals' convention, to discuss the forthcoming municipal elections saw a member of the Shura (consultative) Council endorsing freat within an ultra-luxurious setting very real indeed. In this affluent emirate, construction is being taken to such extremes that there are no boundaries set by any lack of suitable real estate. So, you can buy the island paradise of Iran, France, Texas, Lebanon, Sudan, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, New Delhi, New York or even Iraq, provided you're one of the world's wealthiest and accredited to own them. Israel and Palestine won't exist. But neither will various other countries for merely design and practicality purposes, according to Wahid Attalla, Executive Director for Commercial and Operations at Nakheel, the property developer that has embarked on this most immoderate project. About 10 percent of "The World" has been sold, Attalla told AFP, while around 12 islands are already above water, marking the beginnings of yet another extravagant Dubai landmark. All of Australia, comprising 14 separate islands, has been snapped up by a Kuwaiti consortium planning a mulestors have to submit a company profile, bank references and a track record of hospitality or tourism developments undertaken. Nakheel, which three and a half years ago didn't even exist, is targeting "the big investors, sea lovers and yacht owners," and heavily promoting its developments and Dubai in general at international shows attended by the like. Given the extent of investment opportunity in Dubai and its booming real estate market, Attalla sees the islands being used more for commercial projects than private homes. And "with the exception of one or two cases where buyers have an attachment to a certain country, some of the rest are planning to change the (island) name once it's developed," he said. Affluent Dubai, which has launched a bid to establish itself as the Gulf's business and leisure hub, has ambitious plans to attract 15 million visitors by 2010 and 40 million by 2015.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Rival Shiite militia groups exchanged gunfire in southern Lebanon on Sunday following a dispute over the plastering of political and religious posters, police said. The Lebanese army intervened to separate members of rival groups Hezbollah and Amal after they exchanged automatic weapons fire for half an hour in the vilhey (SDS) expected to gain from it, but it was the story of their corruption that attracted a lot of attention," Habul said. The top international representative in Bosnia, Paddy Ashdown, in June dismissed 60 Bosnian Serb officials, mostly SDS members, accused of aiding war crimes fugitives including Karadzic. He also ordered an audit of the SDS which revealed that the party was prone to corruption and tax evasion and had links to the criminal underworld. The moderate SNSD "sometimes flirted with the nationalists' agenda, but they knew that the corruption of the authorities is what ordinary people care about the most so it was the focus of their campaign," Senad Slatina of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told AFP. "We expected the low turnout to help nationalists, but the big story appears to be the surprise success of the moderates in some of the most unusual places." Turnout was 45.52 percent, the lowest registered in any post-war election so far, reflecting widespread apathy among the 2.3 m under domestic control," head of the mission Peter Eicher said. The 2002 general election was the first nationwide poll to have been organised by the Bosnian authorities since the war ended.

		<t><![CDATA[Iran's reformist transport minister up for impeachment.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TEHRAN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Iran's reformist Transport Minister Ahmad Khorram was hauled before the conservative-held parliament Sunday to defend his record or face impeachment over alleged corruption, carnage on the roads and the awarding of government contracts to foreign companies. He is the first minister in the increasingly isolated reformist government of President Mohammad Khatami to face the sack from the new parliament, which fell into the hands of hardliners in February's elections. However, the conservative speaker of the Majlis, Gholam Ali Hadad-Adel, said the move did not mean deputies were embarking on a purge of the moderate executive. "Whatever the decision of the Majlis, it does not mean that we do not want to work with this government," he said. As the impeachment hearing began, one conservative deputy, Ali Ahmadi, complained that in the current Iranian year, which began on March 20, road accidents were already up 24 percent. "Last year 25,350 people died on the roads, that is 5,600 more than three years ago," he said. "Between the (1979 Islamic) revolution and three years ago, we had 148 plane accidents with 780 dead. Over the last three years, we have had 86 accidents with 212 killed." Khorram, who has the support of Khatami, took over the portfolio after fellow reformist Rahman Dadman died in a plane crash four years ago. Some 116 deputies signed the request for Khorram to be impeached. Along with road and air accidents, they have also pointed to alleged corruption in the transport ministry and his handling of Tehran's new but long-overdue and over-budget airport. In the impeachment demand, Khorram was accused of "tarnishing the Islamic Republic of Iran's reputation" after he handed a 200-million-dollar contract to Turkish-led consortium Tepe-Akfen-Vie (TAV). Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport was shut down in May by the hardline Revolutionary Guards, who said the contract was a threat to national security because the operators were foreign and also had business dealings with arch-enemy Israel. According to the deputies who signed the impeachment demand, Khorram had shown an "unnecessary inclination towards foreign companies." Deputies voted last week to give themselves a veto power over the contract. Another deputy, Mohammad Reza Mir Tajedini, blasted what he said was a "waste of public funds", noting the inauguration ceremony for the airport in February had cost 18 billion rials (205,000 dollars). Khorram was also accused of forking out close to 3,200 dollars for a desk. And female MP Fatemeh Adjorlou said a high turnover of management at the transport ministry had led to "a rise in accidents, including that of Neishabour". In February, 289 people were killed and hundreds of others injured when rail wagons loaded with an explosive cocktail of fuel, fertiliser and industrial chemicals rolled away from a station and crashed in Neishabour in the northeast of Iran. Khorram apologised after the disaster, but brushed off calls for him to resign. In a one-and-a-half hour presentation of his record, the minister refuted the allegations and asserted that development was impossible without foreign investment. "People don't ask us to walk anymore, they ask us to run. And without international resources, it is impossible," the minister asserted. As an example, he said Iran would need "100 years to build 14,000 kilometers (8,500 miles) of rail by ourselves." If impeached in a vote scheduled for later Sunday, Khorram would be the second minister under Khatami to suffer that fate. Former interior minister Abdollah Nouri was sacked in 1998, while seven others have escaped such votes.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Bangladesh's main opposition Awami League at its first public meeting since a grenade attack on its rally in August announced Sunday a general strike on October 10 and a massive street march two days later. Announcing the protests, Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed said the actions coincided with a programme by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-led government to celebrate its three years in power. Sunday's meeting, attended by tens of thousands of Awami League supporters, marked the first public appearance of Sheikh Hasina since the August 21 grenade attack which killed 21 people and which party leaders claimed was an attempt on her life. "The government has failed to provide security for the citizens of Bangladesh and they have no right to stay in power -- from now on we start our movement to oust this government," she told meeting. The strike will be the 19th stoppage since February called by the Awami League as part of its campaign to oust the government, a four-party coalition led by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's BNP. Strikes are a common form of protest in Bangladesh, despite appeals from business leaders and aid donors who say the shutdowns deepen the impoverished nation's economic woes. Sunday's meeting was held in ultra-tight security, with police saying they were taking no chances. "This was the topmost security measure taken for any political gathering -- since we didn't wanted any repetition of August 21," Deputy Police Commissioner Obaidur Rahman told AFP. Some 8,000 law enforcers had been deployed to secure the meeting while metal detectors were placed at entrances to the venue and police video cameras were in place to film the entire event, he added. On Saturday, eo prod China into taking substantive steps now toward greater currency flexibility. "This is a courteous way of urging China to consider moving up any policies moving toward a flexible exchange rates," said Joseph Quinlan, economist at Bank of America. "It's politely asking China to move faster." Quinlan pointed out that "more important than the statement is who is at the table now, and I think China should be at the table from here on in." The World Bank's Development Committee meanwhile appealed to all countries, developed and developping, to take an active role in WTO multilateral trade liberalization talks scheduled to wrap by the end of the year. It stressed the "the importance of translating recently agreed WTO frameworks into tangible results."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Chinese authors Chen Guidi and Wu Chuntao have been awarded a prestigious international prize for their expose of corruption and violence against peasants in China, the organisers said Sunday. The first prize of the Lettre Ulysses award for the art of reportage, worth 50,000 euros (58,000 dollars), was awarded here Saturday to the husband-and-wife team for their book "An Investigation of China's Peasantry" -- which was banned by the Chinese government after becoming a best-seller. "It describes the problems of despotism, of arbitrariness, of corruption, of violence which sometimes extends to murder, and lawlessness, along with unjust taxation, from which a large part of the rural population suffers," the official website of Lettre Ulysses Award said. The book, published in January, sold 150,000 copies and topped the best-seller list in China. But it created such an uproar about blatant atrocities and corruption by local officials that the Chinese government banned it in March. The book is now only obtainable in China in pirate form on the black market. Chen, Wu and the publisher, the Beijing People's Literature, are being sued by communist party official Zhang Xide in eastern Anhui province for 24,000 dollars. Both Chen and Wu are in Germany to receive the prize, their lawyer Pu Zhiqiang said Sunday. Pu said the award would help highlight the plight of Chinese writers who try to tell the truth within the repressive communist regime. "But I don't think it will have a direct impact on the court case," he said. The prize was awarded by the cultural magazine Lettre International, based in Berlin. Organisers said their aim was to select, promote and highlight the world's best literary reportage writing.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GAZA CITY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Seven Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip on Sunday as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to press on with a vast military offensive and the Palestinians appealed for urgent international action. Sixty-six people have now been killed during the five-day incursion -- the heaviest in the impoverished Gaza Strip since the start four years ago of the Palestinian uprising against Israel's occupation. "This is not a short operation. We should act for as long as the danger exists," Sharon told army radio in his first public comments on the operation. Sharon said he had "given the order to change the situation on the Gaza front, to hit at the terrorists, their leadership and those who send them, along with those responsible for making weapons". Most of those killed Sunday by Israeli troops or in missile strikes from combat helicopters were gunmen from militant groups fighting Israel, although one of the dead was a Palestinian deaf-mute man. The fighting was triggered by the army's "Days of Penitence" operation launched late Tuesday and has centred on the densely-populated Jabaliya refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip, home to about 100,000 people. The dead include 63 Palestinians, both civilians and militants, and three Israelis, two of them soldiers. The death toll has swept past that of a May operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than 40 Palestinians were killed as Israee." But the United States has refrained from criticising Israel, saying only that it should use "proportional force" and avoid civilian casualties. "Until now, there has not been any intense international pressure on Israel to stop this operation, as the Palestinians would wish" a senior Israeli official said. In other violence, eight Palestinians and a foreign peace activist were injured by rubber bullets in Beit Awwa village in the southern West Bank after demonstrators protesting against Israel's construction of a vast barrier across the territory clashed with Israeli forces. Medics and sources at the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian activist group, said a 21-year-old Danish women had sustained moderate injuries.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WAGAH, India, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A 15-member delegation of Pakistani journalists arrived Sunday in India from across the Wagah border to embark on an unprecedented visit to Indian-controlled Kashmir. "This is first time in 57 years, since India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain, that the two governments have been able to agree to such a visit to Indian Kashmir," said Pakistani delegation leader Imtiaz Alam. The divided Himalayan region of Kashmir is at the core of dispute between India and Pakistan and has been the cause of two of the three wars between the two countries. "Time has come for journalists of both nations to shake out from the grip of nationalistic ideology and objectively assess the situation from across the Line of Control -- the de facto border between India and Pakistan," he added. Alam said the delegation would visit Indian Kashmir's winter capital Jammu on Friday where they would hold talks with Muslim and non-Muslim organizations as well as Kashmir-based journalists. The delegation would later visit Indian Kashmir's valley region, including the summer capital Srinagar, which are the worst-hit areas of a 14-year-old Islamic separatist insurgency in which tens and thousands have died. The Pakistani journalists would also hold talks with representatives of Indian Kashmir's main separatist political alliance, the Hurriyat. Alam said the delegation would meet representatives of Hindu groups and political parties, including Kashmir Hindu Pandits (upper castes) who have been displaced from their ancestral homes in the valley region. The visit comes after India's foreign ministry earlier this month announced an easier visa regime with Pakistan for various groups including journalists, doctors and academics to promote a peace process between the two countries. The new regime allowed Pakistani journalists with three years' experience at "national or international media of repute" multiple-entry visas without requiring them to report to police. Visa regulations have steadily relaxed since Pakistan and India launched a cautious diplomatic drive last year to repair relations after a near-war over divided Kashmir. A number of Indian and Pakistani delegations have visited each other's countries to strengthen people-to-people contacts even as officials have been working to reduce political hostilities.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The political leader of Spain's armed Basque separatist group ETA, Mikel "Antza" Albizu Iriarte, was among 17 people arrested Sunday in raids by anti-terrorist police in southwestern France, officials said. Albizu Iriarte, 43, was arrested in the town of Salies de Bearn along with his girlfriend, Soledad "Anboto" Iparragirre Genetxea, sources close to the operation said. He took over the reins of the militant group in 1992. Iparragirre Genetxea, mother to Albizu Iriarte's son, was believed to head up ETA's commando cells which carried out attacks. The Basque separatist movement has been waging a violent struggle for 36 years to carve out an independent homeland in southwestern France and parts of northern Spain. It has been blamed for more than 800 deaths.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Shoaib Malik and Younis Khan hit magnificent half centuries to help Pakistan beat Zimbabwe in the second tri-series match against here on Sunday. Malik blasted a crafty 80 while Younis scored a fighting 77 to help Pakistan reach the victory target in reply to Zimbabwe's 252-4 in their 50 overs despite the home team resting some key players. Pakistan faltered in the run chase before a fifth wicket stand of 114 between Malik and Younis brought them close to victory, watched by a crowd of 15,000. Malik was brilliantly caught at long-on by Stuart Matsikenyeri with 53 runs needed while Younis was run out with just one to get, leaving Shahid Afridi to surpass the target with a six off the first ball of the 49th over. Malik's 104-ball innings was spiced with four boundaries and a six. Younis Khan, wand in the last 10 overs with Taibu hitting 13 off Naveed who finished with Pakistan's third most expensive one-day bowling figures of 2-82. Waqar Younis conceded 86 runs in his 10 overs against Sri Lanka at Benoni, South Africa in 1997-1998 while Ataur Rehman gave away 85 against India at Sharjah in 1995-1996. All three teams will face each other twice with the top two teams qualifying for October 16 final in Lahore.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp has publicly apologised to Everton's Tim Cahill after his horror tackle on the Australian international at Goodison Park. Cahill was forced out of the Premiership match after an hour on Saturday and will probably miss his country's forthcoming World Cup qualifier against the Solomon Islands. To add to Everton's frustrations, they also went down to a 1-0 defeat. "It was just not meant," said Redknapp. "There was no intention there whatsoever and, for me personally, it's taken the gloss off what was a great result for Tottenham. "I tried to let the ball run and I can imagine it looks bad. As I tried to let it run my left foot has gone out and I don't even try to tackle with my left foot, I'm right footed. "It was one of those things and I hope there is no serious damage. It's just not my game. "I just hope he's okay. There was absolutely no maliciousness in the tackle, that's all I can say. I can put my hand on my heart and say that."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Jordan's King Abdullah II on Sunday accused Israel of "arrogance" and warned that its policies would fuel extremism in the region, calling on the international community to help re-start Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, the official Petra news agency reported. "Israel's arrogance and the pursuit of its policy of assassinations and mass killings of Palestinian civilians as well as the destruction of property and infrastructure in the Palestinian territories does not serve the peace process," the king was quoted as saying. "Such action will increase the cycle of violence and fuel the phenomenon of extremism in the region," he told a visiting British delegation. His remarks came as the Israeli army pressed ahead with a five-day raid on the Gaza Strip which has left 66 people dead since Tuesday, most of them Palestinians. He also urged the Palestinian Authority "to settle its internal disputes and close its ranks in order to achieve the aspirations of the Palestinian people and to become an effective partner in the peace process". King Abdullah also called on the international community to support a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in line with the Middle East peace blueprint known as the "roadmap".]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Germany's Greens Sunday condemned the government's decision to send armoured vehicles to Iraq, implictly criticising their own leading man in cabinet, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. A party congress of the Greens, junior partners in the government coalition together with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats, rejected plans to provide Iraqi's new armed forces with some 20 Fuchs armoured personnel carriers. "We do not approve of the delivery of Fuchs armoured transport vehicles to Iraq," said a resolution: "The (Greens) parliamentary group and Greens serving in the government are urged to prevent any arms delivery to Iraq." The resolution will not affect the decision last week by the government's security council, of which Fischer is a member together with Schroeder, Defence Minister Peter Struck and Interior Minister Otto Schily. But its aim was to dissuade Fischer and the Greens parliamentary group from condo troops could train with them, government spokesman Bela Anda reiterated. German military personnel have also been helping to train police and Iraqi soldiers outside the country, mainly in the United Arab Emirates. Germany's Fuchs armoured vehicles, known as Foxes elsewhere, became the focus of international attention before the war because a team of them with nuclear, biological and chemical detecting equipment was based in Kuwait. The United States asked Germany to have them on standby in case of a chemical weapons attack when it tried to oust president Saddam Hussein. Germany feared that providing help could drag it into the war but left the vehicles in the Gulf state nevertheless. The US military currently has a number of its own Fox vehicles in Iraq.]]></c>

A resolution passed at the Greens' annual two-day meeting here declared that any shifting of the asylum procedure to a third country "ran contrary to the principles of the rule of law." Speaking at a European union meeting of interior ministers on Friday, German Interior Minister Otto Schilly defended his plan for the setting up of special holding centres, saying it was necessary "to work more closely with Mediterranean countries and avoid so many deaths during crossings to Europe." Schily is to present his plans at a meeting of interior ministers from Italy, Germany, France, Britain and Spain in Florence later this month.

		<c><![CDATA[A band of young Indian field hockey players who were considered no-hopers till recently have raised expectations of victory over Pakistan in an ongoing Test series. India trail 2-1 at the half-way mark of the eight-match series. But their showing on the Pakistan leg was encouraging and they have the home advantage in the remaining four matches. A new-look team without experienced players like Dhanraj Pillay, Prabhjot Singh and Gagan Ajit Singh, and a recent dismal run against their arch rivals, meanped on properties, the French interior ministry said. Documents and large sums of cash were also seized. Spanish anti-terrorist officials said a total of 21 people had been arrested in the raids, including a Spanish truckdriver arrested in the central Spanish city of Burgos whose wife was among those grabbed in France. They did not explain the difference with the French arrest figures. Spanish Interior Minister Jose Antonio Alonso said the "major operation" had been "of very high importance". ETA has been blamed for the deaths of more than 800 people in its violent 36-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland comprising parts of northern Spain and southwestern France. It has long used parts of southern France as a rear base for its attacks in Spain, but has recently been weakened by coordinated operations by the two nations. The French interior ministry said of Sunday's raids that "the intelligence work was carried out in close collaboration with the Sn the video. It also criticised the French government for doing nothing to help the country's Basque people except "offer them a slow death" and urged Basques in France and Spain to join together to seek independence. The last fatal attack by ETA was in May 2003, when two policemen were killed in the northern province of Navarra in a car-bomb attack.]]></c>

Erdogan, speaking to German and Turkish business leaders, said the Turkish government could not predict whether Ankara would become an EU member "in 10 or 15 years." He criticised political leaders opposed to Turkey joining the EU who argued that it did not belong to European civilisation. Some European political leaders needed to "change their mentality," he said, adding that Turkey considered itself to share a "likeness of European values." The European Commission will on Wednesday release a report that will evaluate the progress Turkey has achieved in embracing EU norms and make a recommendation on whether EU leaders should decide to open membership talks with Ankara at a December 17 summit. The EU report, already seen by AFP, says that Turkey has made significant reforms to prepare to one day join the EU, but that it still falls short in many key areas. Turkey claims that it has fulfilled the required political criteria to begin such talks and says it deserves a firm date.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The head of the International Monetary Fund called here Sunday for broader participation in decision-making at the IMF at the opening session of the annual meeting of the Fund and the World Bank. "We must continue to find ways to guarantee that the voices of all our member governments are heard," IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato told a gathering of ministers and central bankers from around the world who are in Washington in their capacity as governors of the two institutions. Smaller policymaking committees of the IMF and the Bank met here on Saturday. Rato told the gathering that the IMF had "to maintain a consensus approach to decision-making" and "ensure representation of all regions and countries on the IMF's staff." The Group of 24 developing countries on Friday chastized the IMF and the World Bank for what they said had been their failure to give a greater voice in the two bodies. Elsewhere in his remarks Rato warned of the damaging impact of higher oil prices on the world's poorest countries, reducing their capacity to pay for other much-needed imports. He said that to ensure continued economic momentum in the global economy the United States must take steps to reduce its budget and current account deficits, Europe and Japan have to implement growth-enhancing reforms and Asian governments need to allow greater currency flexibility.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GAZA CITY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Seven Palestinians including a deaf-mute man were killed Sunday in a series of air and ground attacks by Israel forces on the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian medics and security sources said. Six of the dead were armed militants, sources on both sides said, including three who were killed in two separate air strikes on the fifth day of a vast Israeli army operation aimed at halting rocket attacks on its soil. To date, 66 people have been killed in the raid which started near midnight on Tuesday, including 63 Palestinians and three Israelis, two of them soldiers. The latest deaths brought to 4,418 the number of people killed since the outbreak of the intifada or uprising against Israeli occupation in September 2000, including 3,394 Palestinians and 953 Israelis. In the first air strike Sunday, two militants from the radical Popular Resistance Committees were killed and a third injured just after they fired a rocket into southern Israel from a strip of land near Beit Hanun village. A spokesman for the movement told AFP that the men were from its armed wing, the Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades and had fired at least one so-called Nasser 3 rocket towards Israel. The dead were named as Faadi Azanin and Loay Hamad. An army spokeswoman confirmed that two Palestinians had been killed after a group of men were seen firing a Qassam rocket across the border into Israel and were preparing to fire a second. "The helicopter also destroyed a cart full of Qassam rockets," she added. Shortly afterwards, a third militant from the Popular Resistance Committees was killed when an attack helicopter fired a missile on the Jabaliya refugee camp, medics and security sources said. Militant sources named him as 26-year-old Maher Zakut. A deaf-mute Palestinian civilian, Raed Abu Wadi, 36, was also shot dead by Israeli troops in Jabaliya camp. An Israeli military source admitted the man was not armed but said troops felt he was "a threat" to troops operating in Jabaliya. "Since the start of the operation, he has been standing outside his house wearing a bullet-proof vest and watching the force," the source said. "Today troops opened fire towards him and identified a hit. He was watching their moves and we don't know who he was passing that information on to." Another three militants, all believed to be from the Islamic Jihad's military wing the Al Quds Brigades, were killed in two separate incidents in Jabaliya camp, security sources said. An Israeli army spokesman said the men had been preparing to launch a missile or trying to plant a bomb.]]></c>

It was was the seventh month in a row that consumer price inflation dipped below the government's year-end target of 12 percent, set as part of a tight program of economic recovery watched by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Wholesale prices meanwhile increased 1.85 percent in September from August, up 12.50 percent from September last year. Cutting the country's chronic inflation is a key element of a 16-billion-dollar stand-by deal that Turkey signed with the IMF after two severe financial crises in 2001. In 2003, the government beat its inflation target of 20 percent, posting a rate of 18.4 percent. Ankara is planning to cut inflation down to single digits in 2005.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Ernie Els defied the weather and the best Europe's golfers could throw at him to win the seven million dollar WGC American Express Championship here on Sunday. Els carded a final round three-under 69 to finish the tournament 18-under par - one clear of his nearest rival Thomas Bjorn. The victory moved the 34-year-old up to second place in the world rankings, dropping Tiger Woods back to third. It is also the first time in seven years that Woods, who jhad been the defending champion, does now not have a single strokeplay title to his name to defend. Els, who had started the day with a two shot lead, had vowed to come out and play aggressive golf and he did. A birdie at the first, another at the third kept him atop the leaderboard. But making sure Els was not going to run away with the championship was playing partner Bjorn. The Dane, who was close to quitting golf earlier this year as his game suddenly deserted him, proved he was back as he matched Els almost shot for shot. Three birdies in the first five holes saw him close the gap with Els to only one as the players struggled in the continual rain that forecasters warned was a forerunner of a severe gale that was heading towards the Mount Juliet course. So worried were organisers about the impending storm that they had brought forward the tee times, started play off the first and 10th tees and sent the leaders out at 10:05 a.m. Els stretched his lead back to two at the turn when he birdied the 10th but Bjorn struck straight back with a birdie at the short 11th. It was gripping golf as Bjorn attempted to rein in Els, bidding to win his first WGC strokeplay event. But Els was in unrelenting form, all but sealing the championship when he birdied the 17th to stand on the 18th tee with a two shot cushion. Miserable as the conditions were it wasis first birdie of the day. It was all too little too late.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A Danish citizen and over 40 Palestinians were injured Sunday during clashes with the Israeli army in the southern West Bank as they were protesting against Israel's construction of a vast barrier across the territory, medics and peace activists said. Maya Gouzare, a 21-year-old woman from Denmark who was volunteering with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a pro-Palestinian solidarity group, was lightly wounded after being hit in the back by a rubber bullet, they said. An ISM spokesman told AFP Gouzare underwent an operation at Hebron's Al-Ahli hospital, but due to complications with the bullet, she was expected to face a second round of surgery later in the day. Another 14 Palestinians also sustained injuries from rubber bullets fired by Israeli security forces to try and break up the demonstration in Beit Awwa village some 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of Hebron, medics said. Six of them were taken to hospital, medics said, adding that around 30 protestors were also treated for tear gas inhalation. Troops used rubber bullets, tear gas and sound bombs to break up the protest during which several demonstrators were throwing stones, Palestinian sources said. Work on the southern section of the vast separation barrier was stepped up in September after a double suicide bombing in the southern Israeli city of Beersheva carried out by Palestinian militants from Hebron. Construction had previously been focused on the north of the West Bank. Israel insists the barrier is vital to stop suicide attacks while the Palestinians say its route, often jutting deep inside the occupied territory, shows its real intention is to swallow their land.]]></c>

The announcement comes after former Romanian prime minister Theodor Stolojan, leader of the main opposition party, on Saturday announced he was bowing out of the race for health reasons. Alliance spokesman Calin Popescu-Tariceanu said that after Stolojan's unexpected announcement the coalition "wants to send a message of unity and strength to the electorate." Political commentators have said that Stolojan's departure, less than two months before the November 28 poll, risks relaunching rivalries within the coalition and destabilizing it. The 60-year-old Stolojan, who led the country between 1991 and 1992, was a unifying force within the opposition Justice and Truth coalition, consisting of his National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. An early August poll showed the government of Prime Minister Adrian Nastase eight percentage points ahead of the opposition coalition, with 43 percent of the vote.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Human rights activists protested on Sunday outside a top-security jail in London where some foreign nationals have been detained without trial for almost three years under controversial anti-terrorism laws. Dubbing Belmarsh Prison in the southeast of the capital "Guantanamo UK", after the US detention centre for Al-Qaeda and Taliban suspects in Cuba, the several hundred demonstrators demanded the government either charge the suspects or free them. According to rights groups, a total of 14 foreign nationals are being held in British jails or secure hospitals under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, passed soon after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. It allows foreigners to be jailed indefinitely without charge or trial if the home secretary rules they are suspected of involvement in international terrorism, and they opt not to leave the country. "The use of detention without trial damages the legal system, damages the fight against terrorism and damages Britain's reputation internationally," said Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties group Liberty. "We need an alternative now that ends this injustice." The 2001 law, which saw the first arrests soon after it was passed, has been defended by Home Secretary David Blunkett as a necessary measure in the battle against terrorism. However in August, an influential committee of British parliamentarians said it should be scrapped "as a matter of urgency", while Blunkett has also suffered legal reverses over individual detainees. In April, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), a tribunal which decides the status of foreign nationals facing detention or deportation on the grounds of national security, ordered that a suspected Algerian terrorist should be released into house arrest duthan later.]]></c>

It said the talks Saturday involving Syrian Finance Minister Mohammed al-Hussein and US Treasury officials were a follow-up to consultations held last month in Damascus and that the last outstanding issues were resolved. Dureid Dargham, director of the state-owned bank, also took part in the Washington talks and said he hoped for cooperation between the two sides "rather than a futile confrontation". The United States has raised concerns over the alleged involvement of the Syrian bank in money-laundering operations and the financing of terrorism, threatening sanctions under the Patriot Act passed after the September 11 attacks. Syria itself has been under US economic sanctions since May on charges of supporting terrorism and working to destabilise Iraq. But US Secretary of State Colin Powell said last month that Damascus had since shown a "positive" attitude in addressing US concerns on securing the border with its eastern neighbour to keep out anti-US fighters.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Slovenian election expected to see right-wing gain ground by Bojan Kavcic (UPDATES, ADDS quotes).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenians voted Sunday in general elections where the ruling centre-left looked likely to lose support to the right-wing and form a broad coalition with them to stay in power. Prime Minister Anton Rop admitted that voting was likely to be close and hinted that after nearly 12 years at the helm, his Liberal Democracy party (LDS) would form a coalition with its rivals to remain in power. "I expect we'll score a solid relative victory, and we will create a good coalition capable of leading Slovenia forward," he said after casting his ballot at Vodice, 10 kilometres (six miles) north of the capital Ljubljana. "I think results will be tight and that at first sight it might seem hard to agree on a coalition but some might be surprised how fast we will agree on it," Rop added. "I expect maybe a wider coalition but a stable government." Public support has shifted to the right over the past year-and-a-half and opinion polls have put the LDS and its main rival, the centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), neck-to-neck. SDS leader Janez Jansa said his party and its conservative ally New Slovenia wanted a "sufficient majority" that would allow them to shake-up politics in the former Yugoslav state that joined the European Union in May. "We in fact need a really good result in order to change Slovenian politics. Wide coalitions usually mean. inefficient rule," he said at a polling station in Ljubljana's Grosuplje suburb. Turnout was seen as vital in the vote, as the SDS did well in the European Parliament elections in June, but by Sunday afternoon the Slovenian Electoral Commission predicted only about half of the country's 1.6 million registered voters would visit polls. "If we assume voters' customs have not changed significantly, then we could expect a final turnout around 50 percent or 60 at the most," commission secretary Marko Golobic said. Three hours before polls were due to close at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT), the independent institute Nina Media predicted that the LDS and its coalition partner would take 38 seats and SDS and New Slovenia together 36 seats in the 90-member parliament. It said the Slovenian Nationalist Party would take seven seats, putting it in the position of kingmaker. There are candidates from 20 parties in the running, and exit poll projections are expected immediately after polls closed. Voting took place against the backdrop of a journalists' strike and new twist in the country's troubled relations with neighbouring Croatia. Zagreb chose election day to create a protected fishing and ecological area off its Adriatic coast, which Slovenia has complained would leave it without access to international shipping waters. Rop's handling of long-standing territorial disputes with Croatia has been criticised by the SDS in the el a six. Younis Khan, who surprisingly played wicketkeeper despite Pakistan summoning reserve keeper Kamran Akmal, continued the victory pursuit, hitting four boundaries and a six off 86 deliveries to earn the man of the match award. Earlier Pakistan's top order batsmen were rattled by Zimbabawe's new ball bowler Tinashe Panyangara who had opener Yasir Hameed caught behind with the fourth ball for nought then trapped Bazid for naught and then had Salman Butt caught at mid-on for 30. The 19-year-old Panyangara, from Marondera, could have got the fourth wicket had Mark Vermeulen held a low catch in the slip when Malik was on just 10. Panyangara finished with a career best figures of 3-28, bettering his 2-48 he took against Australia in Zimbabwe earlier this year. In Zimbabwe's innings, Brendon Taylor hit six boundaries at the top of the order in his 73 while Ebrahim steadied the innings, hitting four boundaries in his 71 not out.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JOHANNESBURG, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma received bribes worth close to 1.3 million rand (185,000 dollars/150,000 euros) from French defence group Thales through his financial adviser, a newspaper said Sunday quoting an auditors' report. International auditors KPMG also found that Zuma solicited an annual 500,000-rand bribe from Thales in return for shielding the company from an investigation of a 1999 arms deal, the Sunday Times reported. "The report is top secret and mind-blowing," the Sunday Times quoted an official close to the investigation as saying. The auditors' report is due to be introduced as evidence in the corruption trial beginning on October 11 in the port city of Durban of Zuma's financial adviser Schabir Shaik. The Shaik trial will be closely watched for its impact on the political career of Zuma, who is widely seen as a potential successor to President Thabo Mbeki when he steps down in 2009. The report "provides forensic details of payments that allegedly prove an extensive financial relationship between Zuma and Shaik, his financial adviser", said the newspaper. The payments are believed to have been made between 1996 and 2002. Zuma has repeatedly denied the charges of bribe-taking. South Africa's top prosecutor last year said that while there was prima facie evidence of corruption by Zuma, it was not sufficient to bring charges against him.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is to pay a three-day visit to Zimbabwe this week to discuss a range of issues from trade to AIDS, reports here said Sunday. Museveni is to arrive in Harare early Monday for the start of the visit, his first since the end of the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) when the two countries were supporting opposite sides. During that conflict, which began in August 1998 and ended two years ago, Uganda sided with Rwanda in backing rebels fighting to topple the government of the late DRC president, Laurent Kabila. Zimbabwe deployed thousands of troops to prop up Kabila's government. The private Standard newspaper reported Sunday that the east African leader would be leading a business delegation to look at prospects for cooperation in various fields, including cattle-ranching. Museveni would also hold "wide-ranging talks" with President Robert Mugabe, and the Ugandan delegation is to share knowledge on dealing with the HIV pandemic, the paper said. Around one in every four Zimbabwean adults is infected with HIV, and at least 2,000 people are estimated to die each week from AIDS.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MONROVIA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Football legend George Weah is being urged by fellow Liberians to join the race for the presidency of the west African state emerging from a lengthy and devastating war. "Several groups comprised of youth and business people want Oppong to be the next president of Liberia because according to them, the politicians have failed to deliver good governance for Liberians," Sam Dean, publisher of the Independent newspaper, told AFP. In September, a group of young politicians who call themsevles Redeem Liberia published a petition in local papers asking "the most popular man in Liberia" and Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF to present his candidacy for the elections due to be held in October next year. "After several years of bloody and fratricidal war that destroyed unity in the country, Liberians need a true patriot, a humanitarian, and George Weah has the potential to redeem the nation by reuniting Liberians," the petition said. The former striker of Paris St Germain and AC Milan, the only African ever to win FIFA's Footballer of the Year award, has not yet declared whether he will throw his hat in the presidential ring. Weah, who lives in the United States, returns for only short periods of time to Liberia, where he has invested in a local radio station, King FM. "Weah already has the experience at a lower level, when he worked in the Football Association as the Liberian Soccer Ambassador," said Anthony Nimely, a sociology professor at Monrovia's university. "In such a situation, there are two powers: the natural power and the political power," Nimely added, "Weah has the natural power through football, now he has to do the transition to reach the higher level." Weah has this year returned to his native country to support a UN campaign to disarm an estimated 21,0ing up human rights matters during his trip, but would do so "politely and discreetly". The aides said he would submit an EU-held list of names of dissidents.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[World Bank President James Wolfensohn scolded world leaders here Sunday, faulting them for failing to make good on commitments to the poor and of holding regular meetings that yield little more than praise and blame. "In today's world, we are not only national citizens but global citizens," Wolfensohn told the opening session of the annual general meeting of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. "Without greater visible engagement by global leadership, we will not make the breakthroughs we need to ensure real security and peace," he told ministers and central bank presidents from around the world, who are in Washington in their capacity as members of the IMF and World Bank board of governors. "The way our system works today is that, at a sequence of global meetings, we agree on objectives. On everything from environmental goals, to the importance of gender equity, to education." National governments then set out to meet the objectives, holding another meeting in five years. "Usually the meeting concludes that we have not achieved our objectives. New targets are set. Blame and praise is attributed and we set out on the next five years." While such gatherings are valuable, Wolfensohn said, "we are falling behind on the goals we have set. We need stronger leadership and we need more continuous engagement on the key global issues." He recalled that at international conferences over the last three years -- in Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg -- rich countries made promises on aid, trade and assistance and poor countries pledged to improve their governance and institutions. But the world is nevertheless falling behind on a 2000 commitment to halve the proportion of the population living in poverty. While that particular goal, thanks to China and India, will likely be reached, "we already know that most of other goals, for most countries, will not be met," Wolfensohn said. "Africa in particular will be left far behind." Elsewhere in his remarks, Wolfensohn, whose term as World Bank president ends next June, said that the danger in the world's preoccupation with the war on terrorism is that "we lose sight of the longer-term and equally urgent causes of our insecure world: poverty, frustration and lack of hope." Citing his experience of having visited more than 100 countries in his 10 years as World Bank head, Wolfensohn said he found that poor people want security too. "But they define it differently than we do. For them it is not about concrete barriers and military force. For them it is the chance to escape poverty."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Rice says she knew of debate over Iraqi tubes.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[National security adviser Condoleezza Rice said Sunday she knew of a debate within the US government about the purpose of aluminum tubes found in Iraq, which she and other officials had brandished before the war as proof of Saddam Hussein's nuclear ambitions. In a series of television interviews Sunday, Rice insisted that she only later learned that the Energy Department believed the aluminum tubes were actually meant for conventional weapons, denying a report in The New York Times that she knew of those concerns before using the tubes to argue for war. "At that time we understood there were some debates within the intelligence community. I later learned that the Energy Department believed that these tubes might be for something else," she told NBC television's "Today Show." "But in fact, the intelligence community assessment -- the judgment of the intelligence community as a whole as well as the very strong view of the director of central intelligence -- was that these tube were most likely for use in nuclear weapons," she said. "As I understand it people, are still debating this. I'm sure they will continue to debate it," Rice told ABC television. "I stand by to this day the correctness of this decision to take seriously an intelligence assessment that Saddam Hussein would likely have a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade if you didn't do something." Before the war, Rice and other senior officials -- including Vice President Dick Cheney -- gave no indication of any doubts or debates about the purpose of the tubes. Rice told CNN in September 2002 the tubes were "only really suited for nuclear weapons programs." In May 2002, Cheney told a group of Wyoming Republicans the United States had "irrefutable evidence" of Iraq's nuclear ambition -- thousands of tubes made of high-strength aluminum, tubes that President George W. Bush's administration said were destined for clandestine Iraqi uranium centrifuges. The New York Times reported Sunday that senior scientists considered the theory implausible, and the Energy Department said before the war that they were unlikely to be of much practical use in a centrifuge. The Energy Department also said that Iraq had for years used high-strength aluminum tubes in devices to launch slim rockets. But before Rice made those remarks, she was aware that the government's top nuclear experts had concluded that the tubes were most likely not for nuclear weapons at all, the report said. The newspaper reported that the Bush administration was made aware as early as 2001 that the aluminum tubes were probably for intended for small artillery rockets. Back in 1996, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency had even examined some of these tubes, also made of 7075-T6 aluminum, at the Nasser metal fabrication plant in Baghdad, where the Iraqis acknowledged making rockets, the report said. This finding was published May 9, 2001, in the Daily Intelligence Highlight, a secret Energy Department newsletter, according to The Times. Richard Holbrooke, a former UN ambassador and adviser to Democratic White House hopeful John Kerry, said the report showed that the Bush administration had suppressed information that might have hindered the drive to invade Iraq. "It shows clearly that the Bush administration suppressed the dissenting view. (and) presented a false picture to the United States," he told ABC.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TEHRAN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Iran's hardline parliament dealt a fresh blow to the already isolated reformist government of President Mohammad Khatami on Sunday by voting unanimously to impeach his accident-prone transport minister. Deputies in the Majlis, controlled by a coalition of hardliners and conservatives, accused Ahmad Khorram of corruption and failing to tackle mounting carnage on the nation's transport system and blasted him for awarding an airport operating contract to a foreign consortium. Of the 258 deputies present in the 290-seat Majlis, 188 voted in favour of sacking the minister, 58 against and the rest were undecided. The result of the vote was greeted with a loud cheer of "Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest) from many MPs. Khorram, who took over the portfolio after fellow reformist Rahman Dadman died in a plane crash four years ago, is the first minister in Khatami's embattled government to be ousted by the new parliament. Reformists were ousted from the Majlis after most of them were barred from contesting February's elections. However, the new conservative speaker of the Majlis, Gholam Ali Hadad-Adel, sathe Islamic Republic of Iran's reputation" after he handed a 200-million-dollar airport contract to Turkish-led consortium Tepe-Akfen-Vie (TAV). Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport was shut down in May by the hardline Revolutionary Guards, who said the contract was a threat to national security because the operators were foreign and also had business dealings with arch-enemy Israel. According to several deputies, Khorram had shown an "unnecessary inclination towards foreign companies." Deputies voted last week to give themselves a veto power over the contract. Another MP, Mohammad Reza Mir Tajedini, blasted what he said was a "waste of public funds", noting the inauguration ceremony for the airport in February had cost 18 billion rials (205,000 dollars). Khorram was also accused of forking out nearly 3,200 dollars for an office desk.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[VERONA, Italy, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Spaniard Oscar Freire turned on the power to win the men's road race gold medal here at the world road cycling championships on Sunday. It was a record-equalling third rainbow jersey for Freire following wins in 1999 here and 2001 in Lisbon and achieved in a bunch sprint in just under seven hours following the 265.5km race, held over 18 laps of a 14.75km circuit. Germany's Erik Zabel came second to take the silver, with Luca Paolini of Italy taking the bronze. An attack by Denmark's Michael Rasmussen on the final ascent of the race's only climb at Torricelle, a three-kilometre ascent, was the initial spark that split a leading group of riders on the final lap. Rasmussen's move prompted Dutchman Michael Boogerd to chase, and he was followed by Italians Ivan Basso and Damiano Cunego, Spaniard Alejandro Valverde, and eventually Stuart O'Grady. O'Grady finished just out of the medals alongside his Australian teammate Allan Davis. In the final few kilometres the six-man lead group, which had formed after Rasmussen's move, were joined by a chasing group and it was around 15 riders that emerged ahead of the final sprint for the finish. Freire, a pre-race favourite whose chances improved when Italy's Olympic champion Paolo Bettini pulled out with a knee injury on the 15th lap, was led out perfectly by one of his teammates for the final drive for the line, before he finished off the job on his own. The win means he succeeds Igor Astarloa, who last year won Spain's third rainbow jersey in five years although that statistic is mainly down to Freire. A two-man breakaway dominated the early upped the pace, before Italy's Ivan Basso climbed over the summit on his own. Basso, the third place finisher in this year's Tour de France, was soon brought back following a chase by Dutchman Michael Boogerd, which prodded the peloton into action. And by the end of the penultimate lap, the podium appeared virtually assured when Isidro Nozal led five of his Spanish teammates over the line among a leading group of around 25 riders. Rasmussen's attack was brave, however it only served to force the Spaniards to chase him down.]]></c>

Now the Greens are aiming for a third red-green coalition "with a stronger self-assured green component," Fischer told conference on Saturday. The Kiel assembly passed resolutions reaffirming the party's roots on the left, including reintroduction of a wealth tax, introduction of a minimum wage and universal health insurance, and modifications to controversial employment policy reforms. On Sunday the Greens also criticised a government plan to set up camps in North Africa for would-be migrants. A resolution declared that any shifting of the asylum procedure to a third country "ran contrary to the principles of the rule of law." Interior Minister Otto Schilly, a former member of the Greens party and now a Social Democrat, has defended his plan for the setting up of special holding centres, saying it was necessary "to work more closely with Mediterranean countries and avoid so many of the IMF and World Bank board of governors.

		<d><![CDATA[BRASILIA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Brazilians were voting Sunday in local elections for thousands of mayors and city councilors, in polls seen as a key mid-term test for leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Polls opened at 8 am (1100 GMT) for nearly 120 million voters to cast ballots for 5,563 mayors and more than 51,000 councilors. Lula cast his ballot shortly after polls opened in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city where one of the most closely watched mayoral battles was being fought. Marta Suplicy, from Lula's Workers' Party, was running against Jose Serra from the Brazilian Social Democratic Party. The election is a comeback effort for Serra, who lost the 2002 presidential race to Lula, but who is tipped as a possible contender in the next polls in 2006. Polls show the two candidates neck-in-neck in the first round, each with 34 percent, but put Serra comfortably ahead of Suplicy -- 51 to 40 percent -- in a second round on October 31. "A victory for Serra will demonstrate that the opposition is alive and well and the Workers' Party can't sell the idea of an automatic win for Lula," said political consultant Jose Luciano Dias. There will be less suspense in Rio de Janeiro, the country's second largest city, where polls show the incumbent, Cesar Maia of the Liberal Front Party, widely favored. Run-offs will be held in any of the 68 cities that have at least 200,000 registered voters where no candidate obtains an absolute majority in the first round. Analysts will be measuring whether Lula's party benefited at the local level from his popularity and encouraging economic news, with an eye on his chances for re-election in 2006. Lula came to power in January 2002 promising greater social justice and remains personally popular. On becoming president, the former union firebrand answered the fears of international investors by establishing an austerity policy in a bid to control spending. Brazil is on track for growth of four to five percent this year following a recession of 0.2 percent in 2003. Unemployment was trimmed from 13.1 percent in April to 11.4 percent in August. Election day began smoothly, after a candidate was killed Saturday and a bomb was found outside Sao Paulo. In the town of Redentora in Rio Grande do Sul state on the border with Uruguay and Argentina, city council candidate Antonio Euribides da Silva, 56, was shot and killed at dawn Saturday as he drove along a rural road outside of town, police said. Da Silva, of the ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement coalition, was seeking a sixth consecutive term as city councilman. He has for the past 20 years been president of the town's rural workers union. Another politician traveling with him at the time was unhurt. And in the Sao Paulo port suburb of Santos, three sticks of dynamite wired to a detonator were found aurgents and terrorists, the less foreign fighters coming into Iraq, because they aren't being paid." Both the US military and the interim Iraqi government blame foreign fighters from neighbouring countries for much of the violence plaguing Iraq.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Ernie Els defied the weather and the best Europe's golfers could throw at him to win the seven-million-dollar WGC American Express Championship here on Sunday. Els carded a final round three-under 69 to finish the tournament 18-under par - one clear of his nearest rival Thomas Bjorn to take the 1.2-million-dollar winner's cheque. The victory moved the 34-year-old up to second place in the world rankings, dropping Tiger Woods back to third. It is also the first time in seven years that Woods, who had been the defending champion, does now not have a single strokeplay title to defend. Els, who had started the day with a two shot lead, had vowed to come out and play aggressive golf and he did. A birdie at the first, another at the third kept him atop the leaderboard. But making sure Els was not going to run away with the championship was playing partner Bjorn. The Dane, who was close to quitting golf earlier this year as his game suddenly deserted him, proved he was back as he matched Els almost shot for shot. Three birdies in the first five holes saw him close the gap with Els to only one as the players struggled in the continual rain that forecasters warned was a forerunner of a severe gale that was heading towards the Mount Juliet course. So worried were organisers about the impending storm that they had brought forward the tee times, started play off the first and 10th tees and sent the leaders out at 10:05 a.m. Els stretched his lead back to two at the turn when he birdied the 10th but Bjorn struck straight back with a birdie at the short 11th. It was gripping golf as Bjorn attempted to rein in Els, bidding to win his first WGC strokeplay event. But Els was in unrelenting form, all but sealing the championship when he birdied the 17th to stand on the 18th tee with a two-shot cushion. "I feel great," said Els. "It was a long tough day but we got the job done. After the ninth hole it became matchplay - a little tussle between Thomas and myself. The other guys were a little too far back to really make a charge." Els admitted it had been vital he won after the bitter disappointment of falling just short at the four Majors this season. "I had more pressure on me than anyone in the field. After what happened in the summer I needed to get started again and start winning. I think I showed I didn't want to lose today. All in all very rewarding," said the South African. For Bjorn it was proof that he was finally on the way back. "I'm proud of what I've done this week. I feel very good about my golf. I got off to a fast start to apply some pressure. Unfortunately for me Ernie got off to a fast start as well but I did all the right things," said the Dane, whose secondly, was going to give him a hope. Harrington had to wait until the 12th hole for his first birdie of the day. It was all too little too late. "I found it very hard to focus," said Harrington. "It was a tough day to play golf."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Fresh blow to Iran's Khatami as hardline MPs sack reformist minister.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TEHRAN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Iran's hardline parliament dealt a fresh blow to the already isolated reformist government of President Mohammad Khatami on Sunday by voting unanimously to impeach his transport minister. Deputies in the Majlis, controlled by a coalition of hardliners and conservatives, accused Ahmad Khorram of corruption and mismanagement, failing to tackle mounting carnage on the nation's transport network and blasted him for awarding an airport operating contract to a foreign consortium. Of the 258 deputies present in the 290-seat Majlis, 188 voted in favour of sacking the minister, 58 against and the rest were undecided. The result of the vote was greeted with a loud cheer of "Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest) from many MPs. Khorram, who took over the portfolio after fellow reformist Rahman Dadman died in a plane crash four years ago, is the first minister in Khatami's embattled government to be ousted by the new parliament. Reformists had controlled the assembly until earlier this year, but were ejected after most of their candidates were barred from contesting February's elections. However, the new conservative speaker of the Majlis, Gholam Ali Hadad-Adel, said the move did not mean deputies were embarking on a purge of the moderate executive. The second and final term of Khatami and his government ends in June 2005. "Whatever the decision of the Majlis, it does not mean that we do not want to work with this government," he said prior to the vote -- even though several deputies said afterwards that Khorram was only the first of several who could go. Khatami, currently on a state visit to Algeria, had stood by Khorram. Throughout the day, deputies bombarded Khorram with complaints over mounting road accidents, plane crashes, overspending and mismanagement. Conservative MP Ali Ahmadi complained that in the current Iranian year, which began on March 20, road accidents were already up 24 percent. Khorram was also accused of "tarnishing the Islamic Republic of Iran's reputation" after he handed a 200-million-dollar airport contract to Turkish-led consortium Tepe-Akfen-Vie (TAV). Tehran's new Imam Khomeini International Airport was shut down in May by the hardline Revolutionary Guards, who said the contract was a threat to national security because the operators were foreign and also had business dealings with arch-enemy Israel. According to several deputies, Khorram had shown an "unnecessary inclination towards foreign companies." The minister hit back by saying speedy economic progress was impossible without foreign investment. Deputies voted last week to give themselves a veto power over the contract, a major blow to Khatami's efforts to attract investors and liberalise the economy. Fe fate. Former interior minister Abdollah Nouri was sacked in 1998, while seven others have escaped impeachment votes. One radical MP, Elias Naderan, said Khorram had been forced out for failing to comply with the demands of the parliament, and warned other ministers that they risked the same fate.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Spain's new opposition leader vows to stick to conservative roots.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MADRID, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The new leader of Spain's right-wing Popular Party (PP), which was ousted from government six months ago, on Sunday vowed that the party would not betray its conservative roots in the fight back to power. Mariano Rajoy, the former deputy prime minister who was elected PP leader on Saturday, stressed the party's "firm commitment to the centre" of the political spectrum, but said it would not shun its roots, in gender balance, with women holding 21 posts and men 19. The controversial figure of Manuel Fraga, a survivor from the days of General Francisco Franco's military dictatorship also continues to wields influence within the party. Many observers were hoping for Rajoy to call for renewal within the party -- notably the liberal major of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, seen as a future potential leader, who had urged the party to search hard for the causes of its defeat in March. But the three-day congress skirted around the most controversial issue of all -- the US-led war in Iraq, which Aznar's government had strongly supported, sending troops despite overwhelming popular opposition. The Madrid attacks were widely perceived as retaliation for Aznar's policy on Iraq and the Socialist government withdrew the Spanish forces immediately after coming to power, in line with an election pledge. Yet delegates at the congress voted near-unanimously, with a single vote against, for a motion backing the last government's foreign policy choices. "Is it so hard for a political party to admit a mistake." asked Pedro Ramirez, head of the liberal El Mundo daily, which opposed the war, in a fiercely critical editorial on Sunday. The Popular Party is faced with finding a new role in a changing society, in which an estimated two-thirds of voters support the Socialists' progressive agenda, to include the legalisation of gay marriage, and in which the values of the Roman Catholic Church and the Franco era are steadily losing ground. On social issues, there was a small concession to the party's liberal wing with a vote in favour of civil unions for gay couples, without the right to adopt. But the conservatives within the PP scored a victory over the reformists, by amending a motion which had planned to scrap a reference to Christianity in the PP's status.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Bago handed the Niarchos Family their first ever Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe here at Longchamp racecourse on Sunday in stunning style. The three-year-old colt ridden by Thierry Gillet and trained by Chantilly-based Englishman Jonathan Pease came with a blistering turn of foot to overhaul Cherry Mix in the final 200 hundred metres and take Europe's premier middle distance race. English and Irish Oaks winner Ouija Board took third while Irish raider Acropolis was fourth and Epsom Derby champion North Light was fifth. "He is the best horse I have trained," said Pease. "We were always confident he would get the trip, but he didn't run the race I would have liked in the Prix Niel, so we had slight doubts after that. But we put the doubts to rest today." The Niarchos' had finished runner-up three times prior to this with Hernando, Northern Trick and Sulamani and the winner's participation had only been confirmed on Monday. North Light had set the pace from the outset, with Japanese raider Tap Dance City, and had a three length lead entering the final straight. However Tap Dance City began to feel the effects of his prolonged trip which had seen him arrive only on Friday and faded quickly while North Light gave way to Cherry Mix. His jockey Christophe Soumillon looked set to win a second successive Arc having won on Dalakhani last year and give trainer Andre Fabre a fifth win in the race as he seamlessly opened a gap of two lengths. However, Gillet produced Bago from the pack having bided his time because of his suspect stamina and there was no stopping him as he almost cantered past Cherry Mix to take the tape and the jockey earned a whopping kiss from Soumillon and promptly burst into tears. Ouija Board came from nowhere to take third which was a considerable effort given she had not run since landing the Irish Oaks r of impeaching reformist Transport Minister Ahmad Khorram.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MANCHESTER, England, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Alan Smith climbed off the bench to upstage Wayne Rooney and snatch another late goal to spare the blushes of Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough on Sunday. Smith headed home Ronaldo's deep cross with just nine minutes remaining to salvage a point for Sir Alex Ferguson's men and deny Middlesbrough what would have been an unlikely but deserved win after Stuart Downing had put them ahead with a well-taken strike on 33 minutes. The spotlight was on Rooney on his Premiership debut for United following his stunning European hat-trick earlier in the week but he failed to shine and had to take a back seat to Smith, who produced another one-man rescue act. Ferguson made three changes to the side that thrashed Fenerbahce in the Champions League in midweek, recalling Roy Keane, Ronaldo and John O'Shea to midfield at the expense of Eric Djemba-Djemba, David Bellion and Kleberson. Opposite number Steve McClaren also made three changes to the side that enjoyed a midweek triumph in the UEFA Cup, recalling Chris Riggot, Tony McMahon and Gaiska Mendieta, while promising teenager James Morrison was also given his first Premiership start as a reward for scoring in Thursday's win in Ostrava. Middlesbrough had to weather an early storm from United as the home side made a bright start with Ronaldo proving a major headache for the visiting defence. His clever back-heel released O'Shea but Mark Schwarzer managed to cling onto the Irishman's driven cross while moments later Ronaldo burst through midfield before drilling a powerful shot just wide. Schwarzer had to be alert once again on 13 minutes when he denied both Ryan Giggs and then Ruud Van Nistelrooy from close range in quick succession with brave saves to frustrate United's enterprising start. Having absorbed what United could throw at them, the visitors promptly stunned Old Trafford into silence by taking the lead with what was almost their first genuine attack of the game. Morrison skipped past Gabriel Heinze on the right flank before delivering a teasing cross to the far post which was met by Downing with a powerful finish past the startled Roy Carroll. Middlesbrough could have doubled their lead minutes before the break when Downing powered a volley straight at Carroll which the Northern Ireland international did well to keep hold of. Moments later Szilard Nemeth tested Carroll again with a dipping strike as the visitors began to grow in confidence and United threatened to buckle. Middlesbrough expected a backlash having shown the nerve to take the lead but it never materialised. Ryan Giggs sent a curling free kick straight at the impressive Schwarzer eight minutes after the interval while Ronaldo saw two attempts on goal frustratingly deflected wide as United struggled to get back on level terms. Ferguson's men could count themselves fortunate not to fall further behind on 65 minutes when Mendieta spurned a glorious chance to leave the home side with a mountain to climb. The Spanish star found himself in acres of space on the left side of the penalty area after Bolo Zenden's clever run had sucked three defenders to the near post, but he blazed his shot high and wide despite having ample time to pick his spot in Carroll's goal. Van Nistelrooy saw his header from Gary Neville's cross skim the crossbar as Middlesbrough began to ride their luck but the longer the game went on the more the visitors began to feel comfortable with defending such a slender lead. The onus was on the home side to take the initiative and respond but once again Van Nistelrooy failed to hit the target following Rooney's clever ball but just when the game looked lost Smith rode to the rescue with his sixth and most precious goal of the season so far.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Birmingham striker Dwight Yorke made a point against old boss Graeme Souness by scoring in the 2-2 draw against Newcastle in the English Premeriship on Sunday. Yorke left Blackburn Rovers, before Souness parted for St James's Park, in controversial circumstances this summer and his goal helped end Souness's 100 percent record as the new boss of Newcastle. Souness had won his first five games since succeeding Bobby Robson, but he had to rely on an excellent second-half equaliser from Nicky Butt - his first goal for the club - to avoid his first defeat after Matthew Upson had capped an excellent Birmingham City fightback following Jermaine Jenas giving Newcastle a third-minute lead. Yorke, the Trinidad and Tobago international, had been left on the substitute's bench by Birmingham manager Steve Bruce, but he was forced into action after only nine minutes because of an ankle injury to Emile Heskey and he only had to wait a quarter hour to make his point to his former Blackburn boss. David Dunn, making his first start of the season after recovering from a hamstring injury, was employed in a free role behind Yorke and it was his impeccable pass which sent his former Blackburn team-mate clear of Newcastle's defence to shoot through the legs of Shay Given, with the aid of a deflection off the out-stretched leg of Andy O'Brien. Newcastle had taken an early lead through Jenas, after less than three minutes, in fortunate circumstances when Holland international striker Patrick Kluivert's shot was only half blocked on the edge of the area and was eventually presented to the England midfielder to beat Maik Taylor from close range for his first goal of the season. Yorke's second goal of the season gave Birmingham the impetus to take charge of the game and they took the lead themselves 12 minutes intoriginally wanted to replace Robson, had to settle for a point and his side still only has one victory in eight games this season.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SUKHUMI, Georgia, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia was expected to choose a hard-nosed nationalist as its new leader Sunday after an election held amid simmering tension between the separatist regime here and Georgia's rulers. With polling stations closed and the count underway, local observers said Raul Khajimba -- the current leader's anointed successor and the candidate endorsed by neighbouring Russia -- was favourite to be declared the winner. The identity of Abkhazia's next chief matters because the picturesque enclave on the Black Sea coast is seen as a potential flashpoint between Georgia's pro-Western leaders and Moscow, which has given its tacit support to the Abkhaz separatists. Front-runner Khajimba on Sunday signalled the kind of policy he would pursue if, as anticipated, he is elected as Abkhazia's leader. "We were in Georgia once and we do not want to go back to that," Khajimba said as he cast his ballot at school No.4 in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi. "Whoever wins the election, Abkhazia's path will be that of an independent state. Our policy of moving closer to Russia will (also) stay the same." In the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, there was condemnation of an election in which ballot papers were printed in Russian and Abkhaz, but not Georgian, even though the region is still internationally recognized as part of the former Soviet republic. "Of course we, along with the whole of the international community, do not recognise the legitimacy of these elections," Georgia's Security Minister Vano Merabishvili said late Saturday. Abkhazia used to be the summer playground of the Soviet Union's elite. But after Georgia became an independent state, war broke out. The separatists won, shaking off Tbilisi's rule and establishing a de facto independent state. The conflict cost about 10,000 lives and created hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them ethnic Georgians who were forced to flee Abkhazia. Fears of a new conflict have resurfaced though, since Mikhail Saakashvili, a tough-talking US-trained lawyer, was swept to power in Tbilisi late last year in a bloodless revolution. Saakashvili has said he will not rest until Georgia's wayward regions -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- are back under Tbilisi's control. This summer he announced Georgian warships would sink any vessels carrying tourists from Russia to resorts in Abkhazia. That provoked a furious war of words with Moscow. Renewed fighting over Abkhazia would destabilize a south Caucasus region which is soon to become a strategic gateway for oil exports from the Caspian Sea to Western markets. Sunday's poll was the first properly contested leadership election held in Abkhazia since it shook off Tbilisi's rule in in the early 1990s. It was called to choose a replacement for Vladislav Ardzinba, the serving president of the separatist regime who for the last several years hed by the early hours of Monday morning.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Iraqi Sunni Muslim clerics blast "massacres" in Samarra.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A grouping of senior Iraqi Sunni Muslim clerics stepped up their criticism Sunday of the deadly US-Iraqi offensive in Samarra and of US air strikes on Fallujah calling them "massacres". They warned that bloodshed could not pave to democratic elections and threatened a possible call for jihad, or holy war, if such a "terrorist" strategy was not reversed. "My brothers, we are facing a new massacre in Samarra," Sheikh Mohammed Bashar al-Faidi, spokesman for the respected Committee of Muslim Scholars, told reporters at Baghdad's Umm al-Qura mosque. "It is the latest in a series of many criminal ones perpetrated by the greatest terrorist nation on the face of the earth: the United States," he said. US and Iraqi forces regained control of the predominantly Sunni city of Samarra, north of Baghdad, on Saturday after a massive joint operation from Friday against suspected foreign fighters, militants and former regime elements aimed at subduing renegade areas ahead of national elections in January 2005. The US military said Sunday that about 150 people were killed in the operation and that about 10 percent of the casualties were civilian, but local hospital officials said the civilian toll was higher. Faidi, flanked by two other senior members of the committee, painted a grim picture of the situation in Samarra, which he said was based on eyewitness accounts. He said the city was besieged, residents were prevented from leaving and many were burying their dead in their gardens for fear of venturing out and being shot by what he claimed were US army snipers posted on rooftops. The cleric then invited a resident of Samarra who managed to escape to recount some of the "horrors" he had witnessed. "I saw with my own eyes US soldiers shoot a teenager on the street and even after the boy fell, they kept pummeling his body with bullets," said the man, who identified himself as Abu al-Qaqa, wearing a traditional Arab headscarf. Faidi had harsh words for the Iraqi government saying it was complicit in every way with what was happening in Samarra and other Sunni rebel cities like Fallujah, west of Baghdad. He said it was pursuing a misled and dangerous strategy to bring about democracy that if not reversed would have the opposite result and plunge the country in even more bloodshed and chaos. "Who is going to respect elections paved by the blood of Iraqis and built on their skulls." asked the white-turbaned sheikh. "The government is solving our problems the American way." Faidi warned that the committee would not sit idle if operations against Iraqi cities continued. "When we feel that the whole Iraqi people, their religion and honour are targeted, then we have no choice but to declare major jihad (holy war)," he said. Many among Iraq's Sunni Arab population look up to the committee as an arbitrator in their affairs. Sunnis, who make up almost 30 percent of Iraq's population of 26 million, were the dominant force under the previous regime of Saddam Hussein. The committee, which is headed by Sheikh Hareth al-Dhari, also exerts influence over some elements of the insurgency in Sunni cities like Fallujah, Ramadi, Mosul and Samarra. The clerics have so far been harsh critics of US policy, refusing to participate in the transition process and regarding the government of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi as a mere tool of Washington's domination of Iraq.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GLASGOW, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rangers ensured Celtic did not stretch their lead at the top of the Scottish Premier League with a 2-0 win at home to Kilmarnock on Sunday. A first half goal for Marvin Andrews and a Nacho Novo strike with eight minutes to go gave Alex McLeish's side all three points in a scrappy encounter at Ibrox. Celtic had earlier secured a comfortable 3-0 win away to Dundee United to go eight points clear and put the pressure on their Glasgow rivals. Rangers had opened the scoring through an unlikely source in defender Andrews after only ten minutes. Fernando Rickson's corner fell to Stephen Hughes on the edge of the box and when he drove a shot across goal, the big Trinidad and Tobago international slid in to poke the ball past Alan Combe in the Kilmarnock goal. Despite the early goal the Ibrox side were struggling to find their rhythm or create many clear-cut chances, and with Kilmarnock rarely threatening the Rangers rearguard the game was proving to be a scrappy affair. Danish winger Peter Lovenkrands created a half-chance after 24 minutes when he cut in from the left and evaded several challenges before rifling a right-foot effort just wide of Combe's left-hand post. Three minutes later Kilmarnock should have levelled the game through Kris Boyd, who found the net five times the previous week against Dundee United. He showed great strength to hold off Jean-Alain Boumsong and put himself one on one with Stefan Klos, but he screwed his shot well wide. Steven Thompson then had a sight at goal on 32 minutes when Gregory Vignal's cross from the left found him unmarked at the back post but his header was well wide. Lovenkrands was unlucky not to find the net on two separate occasions at the beginning of the second-half. First he tried his luck with a right-foot shot from 20-yards which whizzed just wide of Combe's left-hand pes, but John Robertson's men finally got a break in the final minute when Ross Tokely's headed into the box and McCaffrey poked home. Livingston had their second win of the season denied when referee Charlie Richmond ruled out a Jason Dair free-kick in the 26th minute, leaving them with a 0-0 draw at Hearts.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Afghan President Hamid Karzai expressed confidence Sunday that his administration would emerge from a historic presidential election next weekend with increased legitimacy. Karzai, who was elected by a council of tribal leaders in June 2002 after the Taliban regime was ousted in a US-led invasion, is widely tipped to win the vote on Saturday. Parliamentary elections are due to follow, although no date has yet been set. "Legitirkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is to receive an award at the same ceremony. "Any president would come to receive an award six days before an election," he said. "It is an honour to receive this award." The remnants of the Taliban regime have regrouped along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan and have warned the people of Afghanistan against voting in the elections. Germany contributes around 2,000 troops to the 9,000-strong NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and the German parliament on Thursday extended their troops' mandate until October 2005. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is due to visit Afghanistan two days after the election on October 11, although government officials have admitted the trip could be cancelled if the violence that has flared ahead of the elections worsens. Karzai admitted he had discussed security for the parliamentary elections with Fischer. "There will be a contribution from NATO and the other members of the international community for the parliamentary elections as well," Karzai said. "But the details of that arrangement are yet to be worked out because we have some time. I hope the joint Afghan-UN election commission will soon announce the date of the parliamentary elections so that preparations can be made for the security of it as well." German troops in a so-called Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) operating in northern Afghanistan were criticised by foreign aid workers for failing to come to their rescue when they came under attack from an angry mob earlier this month. But Karzai said German troops had played an essential role in helping to rebuild Afghanistan. "It has made a lot of difference, in the form of the PRTs, in the form of reconstruction. "Germany has been one of the steadfast, biggest nations supporting Afghanistan," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Low turnout marked Sunday's run-off of the first local elections in Serbia since the regime of strongman Slobodan Milosevic was ousted, with moderates and ultra-nationalists battling for pre-eminence in major towns throughout the country. Analysts said the elections were important for Serbia's moderates, who dominate on the national level, to be able to implement vital economic and political reforms, and patch up their fraught relations. The forces of reformist President Boris Tadic and moderate nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica have joined forces following the September 19 first round in a bid to defeat the hardline nationalist Serbian Radical Party. Turnout was low, however, which analysts attributed to widespread disappointment with the failure of politicians to successfully implement reforms to significantly improve living standards since Milosevic's ouster four years ago. By 2:00 pm (1200 GMT), with six hours of voting still to go, the turnout was between 12 to 21 percent in various towns in Serbia, the non-governmental monitoring organization CESID said. Zoran Lucic of CESID said they expected the turnout to reach some 40 percent. The first time Serbs have had the opportunity to directly elect their mayors, Kostunica said the vote was "versions have remained high since Radical candidate Maja Gojkovic took more than 42 percent of vote in the first round of voting. Milena Zavisic, a 41-year-old teacher, expressed frustration at the low turnout by her compatriots. "I expected people to understand that local elections are the most important for their life," she told AFP. "We are not electing big-words politicians, but those who will take care of our daily needs, like schools, transport, the elderly and children." First unofficial results were expected late Sunday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[AMADI-AMA, Nigeria, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Nigerian rebel leader Mujahid Dokubo Asari on Sunday assured his arch rival in the battle for the control of oil resources in the Niger Delta, Ateke Tom that he was ready to make peace. The two gangs fighting for supremacy over the oil wealth in the region, the hub of Nigeria's lucrative oil industry, signed a ceasefire and disarmament agreement in Abuja on Friday after months of violence. Asari's Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF) and Akete Tom, leader of the rival Niger Delta Vigilantes signed the peace deal at the request of President Olusegun Obasanjo. Both factions hail from the Ijaw people, the delta's eight million-strong dominant ethnic group. Asari told a rally at Amadi-Ama outside Port Harcourt, the hub of Nigeria's oil industry, that he had made peace with Ateke. The town was one of the spots worst affected by the gang violence, which threatened to disrupt the delta's vital oil production. "Ateke is our brother, our son. He has regretted having allowed himself to be used by enemies of the Ijaw nation and we have forgiven him," he told the gathering. "He has dropped his guns and we have dropped ours. If he picks up the guns again, we will pick up ours," he said "Ateke wants peace. We will give him the benefits of the doubt that he is sincere," added Asaru, who said he had spoken with his rival by telephone on Sunday morning. "For the sake of our common struggle. We have agreed to work together. But if Ateke refuses to support the cause, we know what to do," Asari warned, adding that he and his rival planned to visit each other's home towns. "Ateke will accompany me to Buguma while I will in return visit him at Okrika to prove to the world that we are serious about the peace process." Threats made against the oil sector by Asari's group strongly influenced the price of crude oil during the last week. Nigeria is sixth in the league of world crude exporters. Most of the 2.5 million barrels daily produced by Nigeria, fifth largest oil supplier to the United States, comes from the Nigera Delta. The rebels had threatened to go to war if their demands for a bigger slice of Nigeria's oil wealth, greater autonomy for their Ijaw people, and a national debate on Nigeria's problems were not met. Several issues remain outstanding following the three-day talks with the government in Abuja. The NDPVF leader said the struggle for self-determination would continue, adding that the Nigerian government had committed to making it realisable. "Obasanjo agreed with us that the Ijaws have a right to self-determination and we will be meeting him in Abuja on Friday to continue the negotiations," he said. Obasanjo's office confirmed that the president would continue talks with the Delta militia chiefs in order to restore peace in the region, bue said Asari should work towards a lasting peace in the region, where armed violence has left some 500 dead in Port Harcourt and its environs since August, according to Amnesty International.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[AMMAN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The US government on Sunday gave Jordan a mobile X-ray unit to help intercept contraband, including items that could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD), the US embassy said in a statement. "Advanced technology is critical to the effort to prevent the illegal trade in hazardous cargoes related to WMD," the statement said, quoting the US charge d'affaires in Amman David Hale at the handing over ceremony. "The X-ray van provided. to the Jordanian customs department is equipped with sophisticated detection devices that will increase the government's ability to ensure Jordan's trade with other countries is safe and secure," Hale said. The vehicle has sophisticated imaging equipment and was provided to Jordan under the US government's Export Control Border Security programme funded by the US State Department, the statement said. Neither Hale nor the US embassy statement mentioned Iraq or efforts by Jordan to strengthen controls at its borders with its strife-torn eastern neighbour. But the US donation comes a month after top UN weapons inspector Dimitri Perricos said in a report that unnamed contractors around the world have been snapping up scrap metal from Iraq, including items related to Iraqi surface to air missiles since Washington declared an end to major military operations in April, 2003. Perricos, who heads the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission established in 1999, said that a lot of such equipment had transited through Jordan and Turkey, which also shares borders with Iraq. Earlier this year Jordanian officials denied that any parts of Iraqi missiles had entered Jordan as scrap, while customs officials told AFP that trucks bringing scrap from Iraq undergo stringent checks and those found carrying any military hardware are turned back. The pro-government daily Al-Rai reported on May 28 that Jordanian customs officials stopped scrap trucks entering from Iraq after one of them was tested positive for "enriched uranium".]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Scrappy win keeps Rangers in touch with Celtic by Martin Stirling (ADDS quotes).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[GLASGOW, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rangers ensured Celtic did not stretch their lead at the top of the Scottish Premier League with a 2-0 win at home to Kilmarnock on Sunday. A first half goal for Marvin Andrews and a Nacho Novo strike with eight minutes to go gave Alex McLeish's side all three points in a scrappy encounter at Ibrox. Celtic had earlier secured a comfortable 3-0 win away to Dundee United to go eight points clear and put the pressure on their Glasgow rivals. Rangers' win, however, reduced the lead to five points and McLeish emphasised that this was the crucial factor at this time in the season. He said: "It was a great three points and that is the most important thing in any game. "We had a great start to the game with the early goal and that is something that we have not been able to get in the last few weeks. It took a while to get the second but I thought the forwards worked very hard and deserved a break and that is why I didn't change things earlier. "The most important thing is that we are creating chances and it would be more worrying if we were not doing that." McLeish also had some words of praise for Marvin Andrews who won the sponsor's man of the match award. "We always knew we would need Marvin at some time during the season and he was outstanding for us today," said McLeish. "As well as his goal he has dealt with everything that has came into the box and he is an important player for us." Kilmarnock manager Jim Jeffries thought his side had played well and could have taken at least a point from the game. "I felt we have come here and acquitted ourselves very well," said Jeffries. "We have taken a couple of heavy defeats here in the last few seasons but that was never going to happen here today. "It is obvious that Rangers are not operating on all cylinders at the moment, and they weren't today. "If we had managed to keep the score to 1-0 then it would have been very uncomfortable for them in the last few minutes and I thought we might have grabbed something." Rangers had opened the scoring through the unlikely source of defender Andrews after only ten minutes. Fernando Rickson's corner fell to Stephen Hughes on the edge of the box and when he drove a shot across goal, the big Trinidad and Tobago international slid in to poke the ball past Alan Combe in the Kilmarnock goal. Despite the early goal the Ibrox side were struggling to find their rhythm or create many clear-cut chances, and with Kilmarnock rarely threatening the Rangers rearguard the game was proving to be a scrappy affair. Goalie Stefan Klos was a virtual spectator with Rangers in complete command of the game but on 69 minutes he was finally called into action. Australian Danny Invincible drove forward and struck a powerful shot from 20-yards but the Rangers capttary search operation, police said. Two civilians and one army officer were also injured in the crossfire in Kashmir's Bandipora area, 55 kilometres (34 miles) from the state summer capital Srinagar. The clashes were continuing. More than 40,000 people have been killed since an Islamic separatist revolt erupted in Kashmir in 1989, according to official figures. Separatists put the toll at between 80,000 and 100,000.]]></c>

The centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) and its conservative ally, New Slovenia, had taken 38.4 percent of the vote compared to 36.9 percent for the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Anton Rop, the polls indicated. Rop's Liberal Democracy party (LDS), which has held power in the former Yugoslav state for nearly 12 years, managed to take only 22.3 percent, POP television reported. In contrast the SDS, its main rival, had managed to single-handedly take 30.2 percent. Based on the exit polls, neither bloc had taken enough votes to form a government on its own, putting the Slovenian Nationalist Party in the position of kingmaker with its estimated 6.3 percent of the vote.

		<d><![CDATA[GAZA CITY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Ten Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in Gaza on Sunday as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to press on with a military offensive and the Palestinians appealed for urgent international action. Sixty-nine people, all but three of them Palestinians, have been killed during the five-day incursion -- the deadliest in the impoverished Gaza Strip since the start of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Three of the victims were Israelis, two of them soldiers. "This is not a short operation. We should act for as long as the danger exists," Sharon told army radio in his first public comments on the operation. Sharon said he had "given the order to change the situation on the Gaza front, to hit at the terrorists, their leadership and those who send them, along with those responsible for making weapons". Six of the 10 victims killed Sunday were gunmen from militant groups fighting Israel, although one of the dead was a Palestinian deaf-mute man. Another three were teenagers caught in the crossfire of two separate operations in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, who later died of their injuries. Medics at Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital, named the latest victims as Mohammed al-Najjar and Sabah al-Taliyyeh, both 13, and 14-year-old Nidal al-Madhoun. The fighting was triggered by the army's "Days of Penitence" operation launched late Tuesday which has been focused largely on the densely-populated Jabaliya refugee camp, home to just over 100,000 people. Sunday's ongoing violence raised to 4,422 the number of people killed since the outbreak of the intifada, or uprising, against Israeli occupation in September 2000, including 3,398 Palestinians and 953 Israelis. The death toll has swept past that of a May operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than 40 Palestinians were killed as Israel sought to destroy cross-border weapons-smuggling tunnels. Despite the spiralling bloodshed, which escalated Wednesday after a rocket fired by the Islamic militant group Hamas killed two Israeli children in southern Israel, Sharon pledged the operation would continue. "We must broaden the area of action to push back the rocket launchers so Jewish areas along the border are no longer within their range," the prime minister said. Sharon adding that the aim was also to halt fire on Jewish settlements in Gaza, both in the immediate term and during implementation of his so-called disengagement plan. Under terms of the plan, all Jewish settlers and troops are to be evacuated from the Gaza Strip by the end of 2005. The Palestinian cabinet has declared a state of emergency, and on Sunday the parliament held an emergency session, with MPs mulling a proposal to give up one day's salary for vistorm blew up between Israel and UNRWA on Saturday after the army released grainy footage of what it said showed a militant putting a rocket into a UN ambulance. But UNRWA chief Peter Hansen told Israeli public television the pictures showed paramedics throwing a folded portable stretcher into the vehicle and slammed the army for its "irresponsible" allegations based on "flimsy evidence".]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[International award for expose of Chinese peasantry hardship.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two Chinese authors facing prosecution at home have received an international award for an expose of the exploitation of Chinese peasantry which was banned by Beijing authorities, the prize-givers announced Sunday. Man-and-wife team Chen Guidi and Wu Chuntao were given the 50,000 euro (58,000 dollar) "Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage" for courage shown in their investigation into corruption and violence against peasants, prize organisers said. The organisers said this was the first complete study of the situation of China's 900 million peasants. Chen Guidi and Wu Chuntao investigated the realities of the lives of Chinese peasants, their impoverishment, their lack of rights, and their attempts to resist officials tyranny and exploitation. The book described problems of "corruption, tyranny and violence reaching sometimes as far as murder, the lack of rights and illegal the taxation suffered by a large section of the rural population," the international jury noted. It was published in China in January and became a best seller, but was officially withdrawn from bookshops two months later. The authors, who are being prosecuted by the Chinese authorities, hope the prize will help them win their case. "The fact that permission was granted for our journey to Berlin gives us hope of winning the case," said Chen Guidi. The Ulysses award for best worldwide reportage literature was initiated by the cultural quarterly Lettre International. The project is supported and promoted by the Aventis Foundation. Germany's cultural organisation the Goethe-Institut is a partner of the project. With the Lettre Ulysses Award, thee is," said McClaren. "He was one of a number of outstanding performances and I can't speak highly enough of him and the rest of the lads." McClaren's mood was less inspired over the immediate future of leading striker Mark Viduka. The Australian international has been plagued by a nagging hip problem and McClaren revealed he will be forced to miss his country's two-legged Confederations Cup decider against the Solomon Islands. Viduka will see a specialist in the North East to discover the extent of the injury. "Mark will not be joining up with the Australian squad. He has this hip problem and will be seeing a specialist to find out what can be done to cure it," said McClaren. On a brighter note McClaren said he expected Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Ray Parlour to be fit again for his side home game with Blackburn in just under two weeks' time. Ferguson was left frustrated at seeing his side drop another two home points. "It was one of those days. We got to the by-line so many times but it was one of those days that didn't go fo us," said the Scotsman. "They scored with their only shot on goal. It was a great hit. But the momentum was with us and to get a point out of the game at the end was a positive, but Middlesbrough impressed me with the way they defended their goal."]]></c>

Stuttgart coach Matthias Sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten matches in charge of the club and his side are the only undefeated team in the Bundesliga. Former German international Markus Babbel headed the opener on 43 minutes after a spot of pinball had seen Bielfeld defender Petr Gabriel deflect the ball onto his own crossbar. Promoted Arminia missed a number of chances to level and Brazilian marksman Cacau netted his fifth goal of the season in the final minute to cap the win. In the other league encounter on Sunday, manager Ralf Rangnick enjoyed his first Bundesliga match in charge of Schalke 04 with a 3-2 triumph over local rivals VfL Bochum. Schalke climbed an incredible nine places with the victory and are now in seventh after being in the relegation zone before the match. A first half goal blitz did the damage with German international Gerald Asamoah (10), Levan Kobiaschvili (13) and Brazilian Lincoln (44) all on target. Bochum pulled two goals back in a see-saw second half but could not find an equaliser against ten-man Schalke who had goalscorer Lincoln dismissed in the 80th minute for wasting time.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Birmingham City manager Steve Bruce will discover Sunday the extent of the injuries to Emile Heskey and Muzzy Izzet which removed some of the lustre from an enthralling 2-2 draw with Newcastle United at St Andrews. England international Heskey lasted only nine minutes of the game before he was replaced by Dwight Yorke, scorer of Birmingham's first goal, because of a badly twisted ankle, which has blighted his season so far. Izzet's knee problem, the result of a high-tackle on French defender Olivier Bernard, appears more serious and the Turkish midfielder will have a scan today to discover the exact damage. "That is the disappointing thing for us. We keep picking up serious injuries and we are still new to the Premiership and we cannot afford to be without our top players. We will have to wait and see what the problems are and we hope they are not too serious," said Bruce. Despite the loss of two such influential players, Birmingham still managed to eek out a creditable draw in a magnificent game, which saw new Newcastle United manager Souness lose his 100 percent record in his sixth game since taking over from Sir Bobby Robson at St James' Park. Yorke, who was involved in an acrimonious row with Souness during the final throes of his time at Blackburn Rovers, before his move to Birmingham, linked up with another of Souness' former players, David Dunn, to equalise Jermaine Jenas' fortunate third minute opening goal for Newcastle. It was Dunn's first start to a game since February and only his 19th in 18-months, since he signed for Bruce in a 5 million pound transfer from Blackburn, but he was a major influence on the game after such a long time out with hamstring problems. "That is a bonus for us. David Dunn can light up a football match and we need to keep him fit," said Bruce. Souness has injury worries of his own this weekoverhead kick which beat Maik Taylor. "That shows what a good spirit we have at the club. We have had a very difficult week and we could not possibly have been at our best. We would have liked to have played with more flair, but we are more than happy with a point." French substitute Lauren Robert struck a post late on with an outrageous 40-yard shot and Savage also hit the at at the other end with Shay Given beaten and Birmingham have now only one victory to show for their efforts in eight games this season.]]></c>

Dementieva, 22, wrapped up her fourth career triumph to add to the three titles she won in 2003 in Amelia Island, Bali and Shanghai. But it was acheived in bizarre fashion. Bovina, the third seed, raced through the first set in just 24 minutes as Dementieva's game fell apart before the opposite happened in the second set with the top seed levelling the final after a further 22 minutes. Bovina then led 4-1 in the final set but she allowed her opponent back into the final Dementieva levelled at 4-4, went to 5-4 and then served out the match after 1hr 31mins on court.

Matthias Sammer has yet to taste defeat in his ten games as Stuttgart manager and his club are the only unbeaten team in the top-flight. German international Sebastian Deisler was back in the Bayern starting eleven after being 'rested' for the past few matches and his corner was pivotal for the first goal. In the 20th minute Ballack rose highest to head home his fourth goal of the season from the corner kick. "Sometimes (Roy) Makaay is so well marked it creates space for (Michael) Ballack," explained Magath. "It is good to have two people who are so clinical in front of goal." Croatian international Ivan Klasnic should have equalised for Bremen on the half hour mark but somehow headed wide with the goal at his mercy. "In the first half we lacked the bite that we demonstrated against Valencia," said Bremen manager Thomas Schaaf. "We could not convert our chances either." Greece's Euro 2004 hero Angelayern because the team were at a low ebb." Augenthaler claimed Polish international Jacek Krzynowek should have a licence for his left foot and it was clear what the coach meant. In the 10th minute Krzynowek unleashed a 25 yard shot from his cannon left foot and the ball crashed into the roof of the net. Brazilian international Juan (73) and Bulgarian international Dimitar Berbatov (86) struck late on for Leverkusen spoiling the return of Hamburg chief Klaus Toppmoller. Toppmoller guided Bayer to the Champions League final in 2002. Borussia Dortmund fans still pine for their first home win in the Bundesliga following a 2-2 draw with FC Nuremberg. Nuremberg scored twice in the 23rd and 25th minute to shock the 75,000 fans, but Czech international Jan Koller salvaged a point with a brace (28, 45) in a busy first half at the Westfalen Stadium.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[IMF must sometimes say "no" to countries in crisis: Rato.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The International Monetary Fund has to learn to say "no" in some cases to crisis-stricken countries to force them toward better economic policies, the IMF's top official said Sunday. Managing Director Rodrigo Rato acknowledged the role of the Fund as a lender of last resort and said this has helped many countries pull of out crises, including South Korea, Mexico, Turkey and Brazil. But in remarks to the annual plenary meetings of the World Bank and IMF, Rato said there were times when the Fund must take a tougher approach to help countries in need. "The IMF's loans to Mexico in 1995, to Korea in 1997, and the support in recent years to Brazil and Turkey, are some of the examples from the recent past where large-scale support was appropriate," he said. "That said, we also need a Fund that can say 'no.' The prospect of the Fund declining to provide financial support would strengthen the incentives to implement sound policies, thus avoiding the need for Fund support in the first place." Rato notably avoided any reference to Argentina, where a multibillion dollar aid package failed to prevent an economic meltdown, and where the IMF is still grappling with authorities on economic reforms before releasing new aid. And did not rule out further economic bailouts, although his comments suggested these must face close scrutiny. "However good our surveillance is, crises will not disappear, and the Fund will be called upon to help mitigate their impact," he said. "As shown by recent programs, the Fund stands ready to assist members facing temporary financial difficulties. Over the last decade, this crisis resolution has sometimes required the commitment of substantial amounts of Fund resources. In most cases, this commitment has paid off: it has supported strong stabilization and reform programs and helped to limit or avoid contagion."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democratic White House hopeful impressed voters with his performance in last week's debate, but few changed their minds about whether they would vote for him or US President George W. Bush, a Los Angeles Times poll found Sunday. The poll found that Kerry regained ground he had lost after the Republican national convention, which had hammered the Massachusetts senator and gave Bush a modest lead for the last month. Among people who watched the debate Thursday, three times as many people declared Kerry the winner as chose Bush, with 54 percent giving the win to Kerry and 15 percent to Bush. The number of people who had a favorable opinion of Kerry also jumped five points 57 percent after the debate. But voters remained split over which candidate would receive their ballot. Voters who watched the debate picked Kerry by 48 percent to 47 percent for Bush before the matchup, and afterwards splits 49-47 percent in favor of Kerry. The poll conducted late Thursday and Friday questioned 1,368 registered voters who had been polled one week earlier and who agreed to take part in the post-debate survey. Of that group, 725 people said they watched the debate, and their opinions were the basis for the latest findings. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. The earlier survey one week ago, of all registered voters, put Bush ahead of Kerry at 49 to 45 percent.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Anger mounts in France over freelance mission to free journalists in Iraq.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[French Justice Minister Dominique Perben stepped Sunday into the acrimonious controversy over an unofficial bid to free two French hostages held in Iraq, accusing the freelance negotiator of lacking responsibility. His comments were echoed by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin who warned that unofficial attempts could compromise negotiations for the release of the two men. "This initiative was entirely personal," Perben told French radio in a reference to the increasingly-derided efforts of Didier Julia, a member of Parliament belonging to President Jacques Chirac's governing UMP party. It emerged Sunday that Julia had not taken the plane from the Lebanese capital Beirut to Paris on which he was booked. He arrived in Beirut Thursday evening and was then driven to Damascus, where he and his staff made a series of claims about the release of the two hostages, journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, seized with their Syrian driver on August 20. "We advised him (Julia) not to do it but he went ahead anyway," Perben said. "Overall the effect has been negative and that is very regrettable. It is a lack of a sense of responsibility of this gentleman." In a statement Raffarin called for "a sense of responsibility by everyone" and said "all private initiatives" could create "a threat for our fellow countrymen." The operation has sown confusion and raised many questions over government efforts -- in public and in secret -- to free the two men. Chirac on Saturday slammed the unofficial mission as "interference" while his foreign minister, Michel Barnier, said: "I want to hope that the parallel steps undertaken by a group in Iraq will not have consequences for the safety (of the men) and that they will not delay the moment of their release." Newspapers were contemptuous of the mission's instigators: Julia, a 70-year-old UMP deputy who is vice president of an Iraqi-French Friendship Group and an Arabic speaker with ties to the Middle East; and his field man, a 45-year-old former French navy commando named Philippe Brett who belongs to an association that used to have links to ousted Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. Both Julia and Brett had claimed on Friday that they were within hours of securing the release of the reporters. Brett, in a mobile telephone interview with French radio station Europe 1, had even asserted that he was with the two men but did not pass the handset to either of them. Julia, in the Syrian capital Damascus, later told journalists that a convoy meant to take the hostages out of Iraq had turned back before reaching the Syrian border because the US military had opened fire on it. US officials flatly denied tLe Monde reported. Another newspaper, Le Telegramme de Brest, said the plane was again used to fly a Moroccan man carrying a ransom to Amman. Le Monde said, according to undisclosed sources in Paris, Brett had been a go-between for arms shipments to Ivory Coast, where a civil war broke out two years ago. It also reported that France's ambassador to Syria, Jean-Francois Girault, held a long meeting with Julia early Friday, before the deputy affirmed that the hostages would soon be freed. Le Journal du Dimanche speculated that Julia had been manipulated by the Syrian intelligence services as part of a plot by Damascus to punish France for backing a UN resolution condemning Syrian involvement in Lebanon.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Samarra buries its dead, Fallujah pounded by US warplanes.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Residents of the Iraqi city of Samarra collected the bodies of their relatives Sunday, two days after a massive US-Iraqi operation to root out rebels, as US warplanes pounded Fallujah for a third time in just over 24 hours killing at least two people. The stench of decomposing bodies filled the corridors of Samarra's hospital as staff wearing surgical masks lifted corpses out of the building one after the other, shouting out names as they reached the front doors, where families waited. At least 150 people died and scores were wounded in the two-day joint offensive against Samarra, a predominantly Sunni Muslim city north of Baghdad that had been in the grip of rebels since June. A US military commander said Sunday he estimated that 10 percent of the dead were civilians while local hospital officials said that percentage may be much higher. Ambulances guarded by US military vehicles were going around Samarra to collect the bodies of the dead, while Iraqi national guardsmen roamed the streets in pickup trucks or stood at intersections. Many buildings in the city's commercial district were either riddled with bullets or partially destroyed, the streets littered with burnt out vehicles. Despite the bloodshed and destruction, Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib said the mission was the most successful to date, and hinted at more action to regain control of no-go areas ahead of the January 2005 elections. But a leading Sunni Muslim religious group blasted the Samarra operation calling it a "massacre" and warned the interim government that its US-influenced strategy will plunge the country into more chaos. "Who is going to respect elections paved by the blood of Iraqis and built on their skulls." asked Sheikh Mohammed Bashar al-Faidi, spokesman for the respected Committee of Muslim Scholars, during a press conference at Baghdad's Umm al-Qura mosque. Following the Samarra operation, many believe the insurgent bastion of Fallujah, which US marines tried to subdue in April, may be next on the list in light of the repeated campaign of US airstrikes. The outskirts of Fallujah were smouldering again overnight after US warplanes bombed a building where the military said between 10 and 15 insurgents suspected of links with Iraq's most wanted man Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi had been shifting weapons. "A large number of enemy fighters are presumed killed," the army said, without giving an exact toll. Medics in the town said two people had been killed and 10 wounded. The onslaught followed two earlier missions around the Sunni Arab enclave west of Baghdad, again targeting suspected Zarqawi hideouts. One on Friday left several women and children dead, according to hospital officials. Desperate to thwart the US-led efforts to rebuild Iraq following last year's invasion anthe militants may regret their grisly actions. "The tactic of increasingly violent and shocking terrorist acts has the potential to backfire by increasingly turning Iraqi and world public opinion against the terrorists," Lessel, the chief spokesman for the US-led forces in Iraq, told AFP. Separately, the US-led military said South Korean troops have taken over control of relief and reconstruction efforts in a Kurdish province of northern Iraq. Scores of Iraqi Kurds took to the streets of Kirkuk on Sunday to demand that Arab families settled in the northern oil centre by Saddam's regime now leave and to claim the city as part of an autonomous Kurdish region. On the political front, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Gianfranco Fini said the issue of foreign troop withdrawal from Iraq should not be on the agenda of a US-proposed international conference on election plans for Iraq scheduled to take place in Egypt next month. Neighbouring Iran announced Sunday it intended to take part in the meet. "In principle, taking part in the conference does not pose a problem for us," foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told reporters, adding the Islamic republic "welcomes all initiatives that favour stability in Iraq."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Doctors here ruled out a case of the ailment Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Sunday after a post mortem Sunday on an Italian singer who had spent six months in China where the disease is particularly widespread. Health authorities ordered urgent tests on the body of the 25 year-old woman after the emergency department issuing the death certificate mentioned "a suspicion of SARS". "First results of the autopsy showed that the young woman's lungs were healthy had not been attacked by any virus," a hospital statement said. "Examination of various organs did not show any deterioration linked to SARS," it added. Rossella Uttaro, 25, a singer and actress, died Friday at Latina near Rome. She had recently returned from China where she had been working for six months. Following her return home, she suffered high temperatures which became worse shortly before her death. As a precaution, body tissues were being sent to Rome's Spallanzani Institute for Infectious Diseases for further examination. SARS first appeared in eastern Asia in 2003 and led to some 800 deaths, chiefly in China and Hong Kong. More than 8,000 people were infected.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[National security adviser Condoleezza Rice said Sunday she knew of a debate within the US government about the purpose of aluminum tubes bought by Iraq, but stood by her assessment of Saddam Hussein's nuclear ambitions, which she had used the tubes to support. In a series of television interviews Sunday, Rice insisted she only later learned that the Energy Department believed the aluminum tubes were actually meant for conventional weapons, denying a report in The New York Times that she knew of those concerns before brandishing the tubes to bolster the argument for war. "At that time we understood there were some debates within the intelligence community. I later learned that the Energy Department believed that these tubes might be for something else," she told NBC television's "Today Show." "But in fact, the intelligence community assessment -- the judgment of the intelligence community as a whole as well as the very strong view of the director of central intelligence -- was that these tube were most likely for use in nuclear weapons," she said. "As I understand it people, are still debating this. I'm sure they will continue to debate it," Rice told ABC television. "I stand by to this day the correctness of this decision to take seriously an intelligence assessment that Saddam Hussein would likely have a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade if you didn't do something." Before the war, Rice and other senior officials -- including Vice President Dick Cheney -- gave no indication of any doubts or debates about the purpose of the tubes. Rice told CNN in September 2002 the tubes were "only really suited for nuclear weapons programs." "The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons, but we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud," she said at the time. In May 2002, Cheney told a group of Wyoming Republicans the United States had "irrefutable evidence" of Iraq's nuclear ambition -- thousands of tubes made of high-strength aluminum, tubes that President George W. Bush's administration said were destined for clandestine Iraqi uranium centrifuges. The New York Times reported Sunday that senior scientists considered the theory implausible, and the Energy Department said before the war that they were unlikely to be of much practical use in a centrifuge. The Energy Department also said that Iraq had for years used high-strength aluminum tubes in devices to launch slim rockets. But before Rice made those remarks, she was aware that the government's top nuclear experts had concluded that the tubes were most likely not for nuclear weapons at all, the report said. The newspaper reported that the Bush administration was made aware as early as 2001 that the aluminum tubes wer for month after month to use that as a key element in their arguement that we faced an imminent threat from Saddam Hussein." "It is an outrage of tremendous proportions, and is not only a statement of the intelligence of this administration, but the fundamental character of this administration that they would so mislead the citizens of the United States and the world," he told reporters. Kerry campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said the tubes report raised questions about "what the president knew, what he withheld from the American public, if anything. These are questions he should answer now." "Condoleezza Rice raised the specter of a mushroom cloud. That is sobering to all Americans. Vice President Cheney said this was a fact. He didn't say there was debate. He said this was a fact," he told CBS television.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Opposition set for upset win in Slovenian elections.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenian Prime Minister Anton Rop admitted likely defeat in national elections Sunday as exit polls put the centre-right opposition in the lead as voting stations closed. The Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) and its conservative ally, New Slovenia, had taken 38.4 percent of the vote compared to 36.9 percent for Rop's centre-left coalition, polls published by independent POP television showed. Rop's Liberal Democracy party (LDS), which has held power in the former Yugoslav state for nearly 12 years, managed to take only 22.3 percent. In contrast, the SDS, its main rival, was standing at 30.2 percent of the vote when voting stations closed at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT). "It seems that such or a similiar result will remain at the end," the prime minister told journalists. "We will look for the best way to help Slovenia, whether that be as the opposition or any other way. But at this moment I believe we are closer to this (opposition)." The close results mean that neither bloc had taken enough votes to form a government on its own, putting the independent Slovenian Nationalist Party in the position of kingmaker with its estimated 6.3 percent of the vote. Slovenia's President Janez Drnovsek, who has to appoint a candidate to put together a new government, said that if the exit polls proved correct, the lack of a clear majority will make it difficult for him to do so. "If these results prove to be true, it will be harder for me to choose the candidate for creating a new government and he himself (the candidate) will have a tougher task when preparing a coalition," Drnovsek said. National television RTVS predicted the SDS-led coalition would take 39 seats and the LDS grouping 37 seats in the 90-seat parliament. Coalition talks were meant to start on Monday in Slovenia, the most prosperous of the new state which joined the European Union in May. SDS leader Janez Jansa said his party and New Slovenia, which had formed an election alliance called Coalition Slovenia, had hoped for a "sufficient majority" that would allow them to shake up politics in the tiny Alpine state of two million people. "We in fact need a really good result in order to change Slovenian politics. Wide coalitions usually mean. inefficient rule," he said at a polling station in Ljubljana's Grosuplje suburb. Voting took place against the backdrop of a journalists' strike and a new twist in the country's troubled relations with neighbouring Croatia. Zagreb chose election day to create a protected fishing and ecological area off its Adriatic coast, which Slovenia has complained would leave it without access to international shipping waters. Rop's handling of long-standing territorial disputes with Croatia has been criticised by the SDS in the election campaign, along with his handling of the economy, road infrastructure problems and pension issues. Rop has countered that the cabinet he took over in 2002 led the country into the EU and NATO, started the process for entering the eurozone by 2007, reduced unemployment and is on its way to making Slovenia one of the EU's most developed countries. A limited strike by the Slovenian Journalists' Union caused a news blackout on national television for most of the day, but early results were published in the evening in accordance with a law obliging journalists to report on events in the national interest. The country's electoral commission is expected to publish first partial results after 10:00 pm (2000 GMT).]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Italian minister pledges to keep sending clandestine immigrants home (ADDS opposition reaction).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ROME, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Italian Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisanu pledged Sunday to keep sending clandestine immigrants home, hours after more than 600 arrived in the space of a few hours on the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, overwhelming its only reception centre. "We shall continue with this line," he said in an official statement. "The desperate people who still think they can sail illegally to Italy must know they will be sent back to where they came from as soon as they have been given humanitarian help," the statement said. "We are in the process of confronting an emergency situation with the necessary determination but in respect of our laws, international conventions and the immigrants' human rights. "That is why we are turning back at the border all those without authorisation to stay on our national territory, while giving our protection to those who can claim the right to asylum," he said. He claimed that "the assault on Italy's coasts was organised by criminal organisations which exploited pitilessly the traffic in clandestine (immigrants). In no way can we support their game and shameful activities." The reception centre for would-be immigrants on Lampedusa is bursting at the seams after hundreds of clandestine immigrants arrived Saturday night, autorities said Sunday. A total of 1,257 people were being accommodated in a centre run by a charitable organisation and designed to house 200. Late on Saturday night naval patrols picked up a boatload of 223 immigrants about 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of the island, which is some 200 kilometres (125 miles) southwest of Sicily. The boat in which they were travelling was taking in water and sank shortly after its passengers had been transferred to the patrol boats. At about the same time another group of 113 was picked up on one of the island's beaches, almost by accident, by a group of police officers eating in a nearby restaurant. Finally, late at night, another boat carrying 306 passengers (and not 200 as originally announced by the authorities) was escorted into harbour by coastguards. The effect was to flood the reception centre. The Italian authorities are airlifting back to Libya those immigrants whom they believe to have started their journeys there. On Saturday the authorities had managed to cut numbers in the centre to around 600 by flying back to Libya about 300 immigrants who had arrived during the previous few days. Sunday two civilian Alitalia aircraft and two military transports, each with 90 people aboard, left for Libya. The two military aircraft were due to make a further trip during the evening. In all about 500 people were due to be deported during the day. The repatriation policy was sharply criticised by Italy's political opposition. "These hasty repatriations look like collective expulsiomment about the extent of the injury until it is assessed on Monday when Hill is due to report for an England training session. But coach Rod Kafer admitted: "I'm very worried about what Richard Hill's injury means to the team in both the short-term and the long-term." Hill, 31, is England's most experienced flanker with 71 caps and a World Cup winners medal to show from his long career, and was the only man sure of his place in the England back row for this autumn's three Twickenham internationals. The back row cupboard looks increasingly bare now Lawrence Dallaglio and Neil Back have retired, while Leicester's Neil Moody is this week beginning his comeback from a long-term foot injury. And the loss of Hill would be a major blow to acting England boss Andy Robinson as he prepares for matches against Canada, South Africa and Australia on November 6, 20 and 27 respectively.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The world road cycling championships ended in disaster for Olympic champion Paolo Bettini here Sunday before the unstoppable Spanish cycling team left the hosts wishing for a different outcome. Italy, who had missed out on a number of podium places from the time trial and road events in the various categories, were holding back the tears after Bettini was forced out prematurely from the men's gruelling road race. The tough 265.5km race, the blue riband event of the week-long championships, was won in superb style by Spanaird Oscar Freire, who claimed his third rainbow jersey since 1999 to join an elite club of triple winners. Only Italian Alfredo Binda, between 1927 and 1932, Rik Van Steenbergen (1949, 1956, 1957) and his revered Belgian compatriot, Eddy Merckx (1967, 1971, 1974), had previously won the rainbow jersey three times. "It's fantastic for me to become just the fourth rider to win the title three times, and it's good to hear your name mentioned in the same sentence as Eddy Merckx," said the 28-year-old Freire. "But now it is a totally different era to back then. You can't compare." Bettini's bid to go better than his second place behind Freire in 2001, his only worlds podium place so far, ended on the 15th lap. A silly knee injury he picked up after banging it against his team's car door during a wheel change proved too much and he had to pull out. "It's a depressing day for me," said Bettini, who was close to tears minutes after watching Freire join the race's history books. "But what can I say. Freire deserves it. He's a big champion." After a week of time trial races around scenic Lake Garda and road races in the equally-scenic city of Verona, it was Italy's latin cousin Spain who came out top in a race the Italians last won through Mario Cipollini in 2002. Australian Michael Rogers took the first major plaudits of the event when he confirmed his reputation as the world's fastest man on two wheels in the men's time trial. The 24-year-old Quick Step rider, who is considered a future contender for the Tour de France yellow jersey, had inherited the title only a month ago following David Millar's ban for using EPO (erythropoietin). Britain's Millar beat Rogers to the rainbow jersey in Canada last year but was stipped of the gold medal in early September. So after holding off Germany's Michael Rich and Alexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan Rogers was delighted to step up to the podium on the day. "It's a dream come true for me," said Rogers who over the years had missed out on a number of international titles, notably at junior, Commonwealth and world level. "It's always better to win the race like this. It's more satisfying - not just for me, but for my fans and all the people who have helped me since I was seven years old when I started cycling.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Already scrambling to make up ground lost after last week's debate, US President George W. Bush's campaign was forced further on the defensive Sunday by a report that the White House knew before invading Iraq that key intelligence on the country's alleged nuclear weapons program was questionable. National security adviser Condoleezza Rice said Sunday she knew of a debate within the US government about the purpose of aluminum tubes found in Iraq, which she and other officials had brandished before the war as proof of Saddam Hussein's nuclear ambitions. In a series of television interviews Sunday, Rice insisted however that she only later learned that the Energy Department believed the aluminum tubes were actually meant for conventional weapons, denying a report in The New York Times that she knew of those concerns before using the tubes to argue for war. "At that time we understood there were some debates within the intelligence community. I later learned that the Energy Department believed that these tubes might be for something else," she told NBC television's "Today Show." Speaking on the campaign trail in the town of Austintown, Ohio Sunday, Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry said Times report is a stinging indictment of the Bush administration's prewar intelligence and foreign policy judgment. "There are very serious questions about whether the administration was open and honest in making the case for war in Iraq," Kerry said on a campaign sweep taking him through several rust-belt communities. "These are questions that the president must face. These are question that the president has to answer fully to the American people and the troops," he said. Kerry's campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart expanded on those concerns "Secretary (of State Colin) Powell went up and based most of his assessment on Saddam's nuclear threat on these aluminum tubes to the United Nations," he said. "Condoleezza Rice raised the specter of a mushroom cloud. Vice President Cheney. didn't say there was debate. He said this was a fact." "This is about what the president knew, what he withheld from the American public, if anything," Lockhartt said. "These are questions he should answer now." Democratic Senator Bob Graham accused the White House of deliberately using information it knew to be false to bolster the case for invading Iraq. "It is an outrage of tremendous proportions, and is not only a statement of the intelligence of this administration, but the fundamental character of this administration that they would so mislead the citizens of the United States and the world," Graham told reporters. The report is another blow to White House credibility on foreign policy matter as the presidential campaign enters a critical 10-day period, with a vice-presidential faceoff on Tuesday and twoomic issues. Speaking on CBS television on Sunday, White House communications director Dan Bartlett emphasized that Kerry "has been somebody who has debated all his life and is a good debater. But there's a difference between having style and having rhetorical points." He then dismissed the Democrat as "a walking contradiction when it comes to the issue of Iraq." Kerry voted in favor of authorizing Bush to go to war, then opposing the way the war is being waged. Lockhart, a former spokesman for president Bill Clinton and now a senior Kerry adviser, said on CBS that Bush's mistake was expecting to debate a caricature that "100 million dollars in negative advertising had created." But Bush "didn't know how to handle" the real John Kerry. "It was a guy who was clear, who was consistent, and the president didn't have an answer."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[VERONA, Italy, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Spanish sprinter and new world champion Oscar Freire has known plenty of ups and downs during a professional career which began following a symbolic result at the world cycling championships in 1997. Freire on Sunday joined a trio of past greats in the sport, including Eddy Merckx, to become the fourth rider to win the world road cycling champion's coveted rainbow jersey after the blue riband of the week-long championships. After winning a silver medal at the under-23 world championships seven years ago, Freire has always seemed destined for big things. However a combination of bad luck, most notably an injured back, has often seen him come up short in some of the big races that grace the world's television screens. This year, the speedy Spaniard has certainly made amends. Beginning his season with a prestigious victory from the Milan-SanRemo one-day classic, he ended it Sunday by gratefully repaying his team for their sterling groundwork. "I had great form coming into the race, but the team were perfect," said Freire. "From start to finish they all did a perfect job." After claiming his first world title here in 1999, a result which rocked cycling's established order, it wasn't long before Freire swapped his modest Vitalico team for the then giants of the sport, Mapei. "My first victory here in 1999 changed everything for me," admitted Freire, whose victory here Sunday saw him join Italian Alfredo Binda, and Belgians Rik Van Steenbergen and Merckx as a three-time rainbow jersey winner. "Before 1999 I was totally unknown. I was a good rider, but I would say nothing compared to what I am now. "In the five years that have passed a lot of things have happened. I've become a different rider altogether." Freire's second year at Mapei however was dogged with ill luck. In his first year at the Belgian/Italian super team he took 10 victories, including the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race and stages in the Tour of Spain. He also came third in the Milan-SanRemo classic, and won bronze in the men's road race at the world championships in Plouay. The following season started out as a disaster. He fought injury to his back which kept him out of many races, and his career even looked in doubt. "Those years at Mapei were a bit unlucky for me," said Freire. "I had health problems, and problems with my back which meant I wasn't as successful as I'd hoped." But then at the end of his worst season at the team he made amends in style by sneaking up the inside of Paolo Bettini to beat the Italian to his second world road race crown in Lisbon. Even then, after a second prestigious win, Freire continued to be modest. After his two wobbly years at Mapei, Freire moved to the Dutch Rabobank team in 2003. Last season he claimed seven victories in total, and this year he claimed the prestigious winner's place in Milan-SanRemo. On Sunday, Freire admitted that training on the course of his first world championship victory had given him goosebumps. "When I was training for the race during the week the memories of 1999 were coming back to me bit by bit. It was a nice feeling to recognise the places I'd rode past during that race," he reminisced.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Mourinho blasts 'two-faced' matchwinner Cole by Robin Millard (ADDS quotes).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Joe Cole's second-half strike gave Chelsea a 1-0 victory against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge here on Sunday but that was not enough to escape an ear-bashing from his manager Jose Mourinho. In the absence of Liverpool's injured skipper Steven Gerrard, the substitute did his chances of starting for England against Wales in the World Cup qualifier next Saturday no harm when he half-volleyed in a Frank Lampard free-kick in the 64th minute to keep Chelsea snapping at Arsenal's heels at the top of the English Premiership. But Mourinho branded his talented midfielder 'two-faced' and criticised him for being the only Chelsea player not to help out in defence after scoring. "Joe Cole scored a goal, he played really well in terms of his attacking dynamic, but when he scored a goal, the game's finished for him," blasted Mourinho. "After that I need 11 players for my defensive organisation and I have just 10. "In his spirit to create things and to try to score a goal and get into attacking positions, he was fantastic, but after the goal he was not good enough for me. He had two faces. "I was very critical on his level, but at the same time I can be also very warm with what he did," the Portuguese manager explained. "The game had two faces, one was beautiful and the other I did not like. The good one is to keep, the other one is to change. It's normal with a young player like him. "I think everybody else was fully committed with both sides of the game. "He still has a lot to learn. He can be a regular but he has to improve when the team need him to be part of the defensive organisation. The players need to make an impact to me because I pick the team," he warned. Blues striker Didier Drogba limped off injured 38 minutes in and without a specialist forward on the bench, Mourinho sent on Cole to deputise up front. The midfielder's goal extended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season while condemning Liverpool to a fourth straight away defeat. "I have been trying to get in the box more and it's easy to score when I get service like Frank's cross today," said an upbeat Cole. "We've got a new manager, no managers can work miracles but we've had a good start. Now we are right up there with Arsenal and we just have to keep going," he added. Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez thought his side had fared better against Chelsea than in their previous away matches. "We played a good game against a very good team. The only thing is when you keep the ball and you are counter-attacking you need to score. I think we controlled better than in our other games," the Spaniard said. "If you think about the last three games we played away from home, we played Manchester United, Olympiakos and Chelsea. "If you lose 2-1 or 1-0 you are in the right way but you need to do something more." The game pitteiding in to meet Duff's low centre from the other side just before the break. Both sides increased the tempo in the second half and Kirkland had Harry Kewell to thank on 57 minutes when the Australia midfielder headed a goalbound Cole shot off the line. But Cole did not have long to wait to get on the scoresheet. With his only remarkable intervention in the game, Salif Diao brought down Alexey Smertin 30 yards out. Lampard crossed the free kick in low for Cole who, running across the face of goal, side-footed past Kirkland. In search of an equaliser, Benitez introduced Euro 2004 top scorer Milan Baros, Steve Finnan and Dietmar Hamann, but it was to no avail as Chelsea completed a seventh clean sheet in eight Premiership matches.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ROME, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Doctors here ruled out a case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Sunday after a post mortem Sunday on an Italian singer who had spent six months in China, the country worst hit by the virus. Health authorities ordered urgent tests on the body of the 25 year-old woman after the emergency department issuing the death certificate mentioned "a suspicion of SARS". "First results of the autopsy showed that the young woman's lungs were healthy and had not been attacked by any virus," a hospital statement said. "Examination of various organs did not show any deterioration linked to SARS," it added. Rossella Uttaro, 25, a singer and actress, died Friday at Latina near Rome. She had recently returned from China where she had been working for six months. Following her return home, she suffered high temperatures which became worse shortly before her death. As a precaution, body tissues were being sent to Rome's Spallanzani Institute for Infectious Diseases for further examination. SARS first appeared in eastern Asia in 2003 and led to some 800 deaths, chiefly in China and Hong Kong. More than 8,000 people were infected.]]></c>

The Lebanese army intervened to separate members of rival groups Hezbollah and Amal after they traded fire with automatic weapons and anti-tank rockets for half an hour in the village of Bzebdin, southeast of Beirut.

"The secretary general calls on the government of Israel to halt its military incursions into the Gaza Strip, which have led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians, among them many civilians, including children," his spokesman Fred Eckhard said in a statement.

		<c><![CDATA[A top Chinese official said Sunday that Beijing has no timetable to make its currency's exchange rate more flexible, suggesting China was unmoved by pressure from the world's top economic powers. In a speech to a banking group in Washington, Li Ruogu, deputy governor of the central bank, said China would move to a more flexible exchange rate for the yuan "when conditions permit." Li said Chinese efforts to cool down investment in some sectors have had positive results. "So far, so good," he said at a meeting on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings. Asked by efforts of US lawmakers to take the currency dispute to the World Trade Organization, Li said it was not a matter for the WTO and said that China was the goose that gives the US "golden eggs." China was imvited to join finance ministers and central bankers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States at a dinner Friday after a scheduled G7 meeting amounted to belated recognition of Beijing's undeniable weight in the world economy. But the Chinese came under renewed pressure from the G7 to allow their currency, the yuan, to float freely.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder hailed Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as "a great reformer" here on Sunday just three days before the publication of an EU report on Turkey's suitability for membership. Schroeder said that if the report from the European Commission -- the executive arm of the European Union -- recommended that Turkey be allowed to begin membership talks, then Germany would throw its weight behind Turkey. "If the European Commission recommends opening accession talks, then Germany will clearly support that," Schroeder said in a speech before presenting Erdogan with the "Quadriga Bridges of Respect" award given by the privately funded Werkstatt Deutschland organisation for his handling of reforms in Turkey. Schroeder said Erdogan was a "great reformer" whose drive for change could not be dismissed as a "concession to Europe". "It is a consequence of his political convictions and also of his painful personal experiences with repression and persecution," the chancellor said of a man who was jailed for four months in the late 1990s under Turkey's strict secular rules for reciting a poem with an Islamic message. However Schroeder warned that even if the report came out in favour of Turkey ending its wait for membership, it would only be "the start of a long process". First the recommendation would have to be adopted at an EU summit on December 17 and then the talks could take years as the mainly Muslim nation of 70 million would have to meet a series of stringent criteria. Erdogan himself admitted earlier in the day that even if Turkey was allowed to begin talks, it could be 2019 before it met all the criteria for EU membership. Speaking after brief talks with Schroeder, Erdogan said the task lying ahead of Turkey was now to implement the reforms and that his country must not slip backwards in its modernisation process. "The important thing now is that no change in mentality emerges. But we have the political will to overturn that," he said at a press conference. The Commission's report is due to be published on Wednesday. The report, already seen by AFP, says that Turkey has made significant reforms to prepare to one day join the EU, but that it still falls short in many key areas. Erdogan said he believed Turkey's inclusion in the EU would lead to a more peaceful world and that the country could act as a gateway to Asia for the rest of Europe. He dismissed suggestions that Turkey continued to torture detainees, saying there was "neither systematic nor unsystematic torture" in the country.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Cole strike keeps Chelsea in touch with Arsenal.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A strike from Joe Cole allowed Chelsea to keep within two points of champions Arsenal at the top of the Premiership with a 1-0 defeat of Liverpool Sunday as Manchester United were held 1-1 at home to Middlesbrough. Midfielder Cole came off the bench to provide Joe Mourinho's side with a much-needed three points as he struck the Blues' winner after 64 minutes. Blues striker Didier Drogba limped off injured after 38 minutes and without a specialist forward on the bench, Mourinho sent on Cole to deputize up front. The midfielder's goal extended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season while condemning Liverpool to a fourth straight away defeat. Petr Cech made a vital late save from Steve Finnan but Liverpool, who only threatened twice through Djibril Cisse, were unable to find an answer. Despite the goal, Mourinho branded his talented midfielder 'two-faced' and criticised him for being the only Chelsea player not to help out in defence after scoring. "Joe Cole scored a goal, he played really well in terms of his attacking dynamic, but when he scored a goal, the game's finished for him," blasted Mourinho. "The game had two faces, one was beautiful and the other I did not like. The good one is to keep, the other one is to change. It's normal with a young player like him." Alan Smith climbed off the bench to upstage Wayne Rooney and snatch another late goal to save Manchester United at Old Trafford. Smith headed home Ronaldo's deep cross with just nine minutes remaining to salvage a point for Alex Ferguson's men and deny Middlesbrough after Stuart Downing had put them ahead with a well-taken strike on 33 minutes. The spotlight was on Rooney on his Premiership debut for United following his stunning European hat-trick earlier in the week but he failed to shine and had to take a back seat to Smith, who produced another one-man rescue act. With 10 minutes remaining, after neither Rooney nor Ruud van Nistelrooy could break down the visitors' defence, Smith rose highest to nod home Cristiano Ronaldo's cross. Ferguson was left frustrated at seeing his side drop another two home points, although they move up one spot to fourth position nine points behind Arsenal. "It was one of those days. We got to the by-line so many times but it was one of those days that didn't go for us," said the Scotsman. "They scored with their only shot on goal. It was a great hit. But the momentum was with us and to get a point out of the game at the end was a positive, but Middlesbrough impressed me with the way they defended their goal." At St Andrews, Nicky Butt preserved Newcastle's unbeaten record under new manager Graeme Souness with a stunning equaliser in a 2-2 draw with Birmingham. Dwight Yorke cancelled out Jermaine Jenas' early opener in a dramatic first half which saw the hosts lose Emile Heskey and Muzzy Izzet to injury. Blues defender Matthew Upson looked to have earned Steve Bruce's side only their second win of the campaign when he put them ahead after 57 minutes, but a superb half-volley from 15 yards out from Butt beat Blues goalie Maik Taylor. Arsenal, meanwhile, ended a turbulent week on a high Saturday by sweeping Charlton aside to move to within two matches of a phenomenal 50-game unbeaten run in the English Premiership. In the wake of a disappointing Champions League performance in midweek and the subsequent post-match scuffle between skipper Patrick Vieira and right-back Lauren, the Gunners badly needed to present a unified front to the world. That was exactly what they did with an emphatic 4-0 victory over their London rivals who have a record of creating problems for Arsene Wenger's side at Highbury. Freddie Ljungberg's close-range finish from a Dennis Bergkamp cross put Arsenal ahead in the 33rd-minute and Wenger's men cut loose after the interval.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenia's centre-right opposition was narrowly leading in Sunday's national election with 37.89 percent of votes, the electoral commission said after 88.5 percent of votes had been counted. The centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) scored 29.04 percent of votes while its ally, the conservative New Slovenia (NSi) party took 8.85 percent, the commission said. The three parties that made up the country's ruling coalition took 37.16 percent of the vote. Prime Minister Anton Rop admitted defeat on Sunday just two hours after polls closed at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT), saying his coalition was preparing to become part of the opposition. "Although we have to wait until the end, it seems very likely that the Liberal Democracy party (LDS) will move to the opposition. We are firmly decided to work hard within the opposition," Rop said. "It is clear that the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) won most of the voters' confidence. The LDS ended second." Unofficial projections by the electoral commission showed current results would grant the centre-right opposition a total of 38 seats against 37 for the LDS-led coalition. The commission said according to the partial count, turnout among Slovenia's 1.6 million registered voters appeared to be at 54 percent. The close results indicated that neither bloc had taken enough votes to form a government on its own, putting the independent Slovenian Nationalist Party in the position of kingmaker with its estimated 6.3 percent of the vote. Slovenia's President Janez Drnovsek, who has to appoint a candidate to put together a new government, said that if the exit polls proved correct, the lack of a clear majority will make it difficult for him to do so. "If these results prove to be true, it will be harder for me to choose the candidate for creating a new government and he himself (the candidate) will have a tougher task when preparing a coalition," Drnovsek said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Serbian Orthodox Church Patriarch Pavle on Sunday joined calls for ethnic Serbs to boycott elections later this month in the UN-administered southern province of Kosovo. "In God's name, do not call the tormented and martyrs among the Serb people who have stayed (in Kosovo) to come out and vote," he said in an open letter to Serbia's President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica. "Do not make such an appeal to them, no matter who talks you into it or forces you to appeal to them," said the letter which was published by the Tanjug news agency. International officials have stepped up calls on Belgrade to encourage ethnic Serbs in Kosovo to cast ballots in the October 23 election. Kostunica has called on Serbs to boycott the parliamentary elections in protest against the UN's refusal to accept his plans for greater autonomy for Serb communities in Kosovo. However, Tadic said in Belgrade on Sunday that he would continue with a series of meetings with top Serb officials and representatives of the Serb community in Kosovo in order to reach a final decision over the participation in the vote. Kosovo's Serbian minority has said it will stay away from the poll, claiming fears over security. Anti-Serb riots by separatist ethnic Albanian mobs killed 19 people in March and destroyed hundreds of Serb homes and churches, including some which dated back to the Middle Ages. The patriarch's letter came after the top Serbian Orthodox Church body, the Saint Synod, on Friday supported the boycott saying Serbs should not take part until they are given credible security guarantees from international peacekeeping forces in the breakaway, mainly ethnic Albanian province. The southern province is the traditional seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church and remains technically part of Serbia, although it has been under UN administration since the end of the 1998-99 war between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir said Sunday he was ready to sign a peace deal with southern rebels and that he did not want to govern the country alone. The Khartoum government "is ready to sign the peace agreement today rather than tomorrow," Beshir said in a speech to the Sudanese Women's Union. The declaration follows accusations by Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) rebel leader John Garang that Khartoum was dragging its feet in finalizing a peace deal to end the 21-year-old civil war in the south of the country in order to make as much money as possible from booming oil exports. It has been agreed that oil revenues will be shared between the north and the south once a peace deal is reached. Beshir went on to say that he did not want to rule the country alone. "We do not want to maintain power alone," said Beshir, adding that his government intends to stop the war to enable the people to "exercise free democracy". He dismissed as "meaningless" talk about autonomy being granted to Darfur, where up to 50,000 people have died in a 19-month-old conflict between rebels and government forces. "Any talk about self-rule in Darfur is meaningless as every state has powers within the present federal system to which the government will remain committed," said Beshir.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GAZA CITY, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Ten Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in Gaza on Sunday as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon vowed to press on with a military offensive and the Palestinians appealed for urgent international action. Sixty-nine people, all but three of them Palestinians, have been killed during the five-day incursion -- the deadliest in the impoverished Gaza Strip since the start of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Three of the victims were Israelis, two of them soldiers. "This is not a short operation. We should act for as long as the danger exists," Sharon told army radio in his first public comments on the operation. Sharon said he had "given the order to change the situation on the Gaza front, to hit at the terrorists, their leadership and those who send them, along with those responsible for making weapons". Six of the 10 victims killed Sunday were gunmen from militant groups fighting Israel, although one of the dead was a Palestinian deaf-mute man. Another three were teenagers, aged between 13 and 14, caught in the crossfire of two separate operations in the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, who later died of their injuries. The fighting was triggered by the army's "Days of Penitence" operation launched late Tuesday which has been focused largely on the densely-populated Jabaliya refugee camp, home to just over 100,000 people. Sunday's ongoing violence raised to 4,422 the number of people killed since the outbreak of the intifada, or uprising, against Israeli occupation in September 2000, including 3,398 Palestinians and 953 Israelis. Despite the spiralling bloodshed, which escalated Wednesday after a rocket fired by the Islamic militant group Hamas killed two Israeli children in southern Israel, Sharon pledged the operation would continue. "We must broaden the area of action to push back the rocket launchers so Jewish areas along the border are no longer within their range," the prime minister said. Sharon adding that the aim was also to halt fire on Jewish settlements in Gaza, both in the immediate term and during implementation of his so-called disengagement plan. Under terms of the plan, all Jewish settlers and troops are to be evacuated from the Gaza Strip by the end of 2005. The Palestinian cabinet has declared a state of emergency, and on Sunday the parliament held an emergency session, with MPs mulling a proposal to give up one day's salary for victims of the raids. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stepped in on Sunday, calling on Israel to end its offensive and for the Palestinians to halt the rocket attacks. "The secretary general calls on the government of Israel to halt its military incursions into the Gaza Strip, which hatinuing war of extermination against the Palestinian people." But the United States has refrained from criticising Israel, saying only that it should use "proportional force" and avoid civilian casualties. "Until now, there has not been any intense international pressure on Israel to stop this operation, as the Palestinians would wish," a senior Israeli official said. In the southern West Bank, a 21-year-old Danish citizen and over 40 Palestinians were injured during clashes with the army as they protested against Israel's construction of a vast barrier across the territory, medics and peace activists said. Maya Gouzare, a 21-year-old woman from Denmark who was volunteering with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a pro-Palestinian solidarity group, was moderately wounded after being hit in the back by a rubber bullet, they said. The army said late Sunday it had set up a humanitarian corridor for international aid to reach residents of Beit Hanun near Jridge, Steven Gerrard and Kieron Dyer through injury, while Matthew Upson was dropped. England face Wales at Old Trafford on Saturday and are away to Azerbaijan on Wednesday week. Neville had not been included in either of the previous two England squads this season as he is not playing regularly for United. However despite having started just one game all season and not even being included on the bench for Sunday's 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough, Eriksson has few other defensive or midfield options. Bridge was ruled out due to his calf injury, giving Eriksson another headache over his left-sided midfield options. The England coach revealed: "I spoke with Jose Mourinho and the doctor at Chelsea, as well as Wayne Bridge. "He will stay with the club for treatment. On Friday, he couldn't even run and it's better he stays at home. If he's going to be fit for either Wales or Azerbaijan then he will join us. Dyer is out as well, which is a pity." Bridge'svery fit and worked very hard. He is hungry to play football. "It was hard for him but he took it well. I'm very happy to have four central defenders like that and, whichever two you choose, you can't fail. All four of them are extremely good." As for Rooney, he added: "His first half against Fenerbahce was absolutely incredible, especially knowing that he hasn't played football since June 24 in Portugal and had very few sessions with the ball." Eriksson, meanwhile, warned his side to be on their guard next weekend at Old Trafford. After all, when the two countries last met 20 years ago, Wales coach Mark Hughes scored the winner in a 1-0 victory for Wales. Eriksson insisted: "This is more or less a local derby and Wales need to beat England badly. We must understand that. "I suppose England are the big brothers and you always want to beat the big brothers. We have to be aware of that and I'm sure it will be a difficult game. Hopefully we will win."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US national security adviser Condoleezza Rice said Sunday US officials were heartened by progress recent made in quelling a stubborn Iraqi uprising in Samarra, but said there was a way to go until the rebels are completely defeated. "The reporting from the ground is that things have gone well," Rice told CNN television. "I think it would be premature to say that it is wrapped up, because insurgencies have a tendency to wax and wane, but clearly, the really good news out of this is that Iraqi forces have fought alongside American forces, and. they've done well," she said. Officials in Iraq said US and Iraqi troops will continue to conduct air stikes and ground offensives against rebel enclaves over the next three months to give the Iraqi government the best chance of restoring control ahead of elections in January, a senior official said. Some 3,000 US troops and 2,000 Iraqi auxiliaries stormed Samarra at dawn Friday, sparking fierce fighting in the city of some 250,000 people, and leaving some 150 people dead. Officials in Iraq have expressed confidence that the assault would succeed in restoring full government control to Samarra, which has been held by the insurgents since June. Rice said a decision would be made by officials on the ground in Iraq as to whether similar tough tactics would be employed to get the upper hand over insurgencies in other cities. "The timing on any of these efforts really is going to be taken on the ground, because that is where Iraqi and coalition decision makers can work together to decide how much military force is used in addition to the political efforts that are there," she said, adding that in Sadr City where radical cleric Muqtada Sadr's militia has battle coalition troops "there have been very large sweeps, and efforts going on there for some time. "Muqtada Sadr's military has been seriously hurt by the military efforts of the Iraqis and the coalition forces," she said. "Prime Minister Allawi has had a view, which is very smart strategy, that you have to have both a political and a military track when you're dealing with an insurgency," Rice told CNN. "He's certainly been working a lot with political leaders in these troubled places, to say to them, you now have to be a part of the political process, and that means that you can't have support for these insurgents."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[France, Spain swoop on ETA suspects, arrest separatist group leaders.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BORDEAUX, France, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Anti-terrorist police arrested Sunday the political leader of Spain's armed Basque separatist group ETA in raids in France and Spain that resulted in arms caches and other suspected members being seized, officials said. French officials said Mikel "Antza" Albizu Iriarte and his partner, Soledad "Anboto" Iparragirre Genetxea, a suspected former military chief of ETA, were among 17 people arrested in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques region in southwestern France near the Spanish border. Arms caches were discovered in seven locations in the region as around 140 specialist officers, including members of France's anti-terrorist brigade and intelligence services, swooped on properties, France's interior ministry said. Large amounts of explosives, documents and large sums of cash were seized. Spanish anti-terrorist officials said 21 people had been arrested in the raids without explaining the variations in the arrest figures given. French Justice Minister Dominique Perben characterised Sunday's operation as "a great battle won in the war against terrorism. a very fine operation: a political leader, 16 accomplices, arms caches, sophisticated equipment." Spanish Interior Minister Jose Antonio Alonso hailed the arrests as of major importance. "It is an extremely important operation, one that we can certainly describe as historic," Alonso told reporters in Madrid. The Spanish minister said that 700 kilograms (1,550 pounds) of dynamite and 500 kilograms of potassium chlorate, a common ingredient in explosives, had been seized in the raids. According to a French police source, three underground arms caches were discovered in the towns of Saint-Pierre d'Irrube, Urrugne and Briscous, containing explosives, weapons and rocket launchers. A smaller stockpile of weapons was found in Ayherre, while police found a number of documents in the town of Hendaye. ETA has been blamed for the deaths of more than 800 people in its violent 36-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland comprising parts of northern Spain and southwestern France. It has long used parts of southern France as a rear base for its attacks in Spain, but has recently been weakened by coordinated operations by the two nations. ETA has been relatively quiet this year since the March 11 train bombings in Madrid that were initially blamed on the Basque separatists before evidence emerged indicating that Islamic militants linked to Al-Qaeda were responsible for the 191 people killed and nearly 2,000 wounded. The Basque militant group last year had announced thaent" of the conflict. "There cannot be a police victory. The only possible, valid solution. will have to be political." Alvarez is a member of Sozialista Abertzaleak, which replaced ETA's political wing, Batasuna, in the Basque parliament after the party was outlawed last year. The arrest of an ETA supremo at a local farm caused stupefaction in the small town of Salies-de-Bearn. The house where Antza and Anboto hid out had not aroused the slightest suspicion among the 5,000 inhabitants of the town or among neighbours. Parts of the big farm and its outhouses had been let to summer tourists and visitors taking the waters at the town's health spa. "To say we're astonished is putting it mildly," said one neighbour, a retired man: "We don't like the look of it at all," he said of the ETA presence. "Hitherto all that was down in the Basque country."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Reformer wins Belgrade: estimates.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Reformist candidate of President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party appeared to have won the influential post of Belgrade mayor in run-off elections on Sunday, estimates based on early vote counting showed. However, a hardline loyalist of former strongman Slobodan Milosevic appeared to be in the lead to take the capital of the ethnically-mixed northern Vojvodina province, according to the estimates by the non-governmental monitoring group CESID. However, low turnout marked Sunday's run-off of the first local elections in Serbia since Milosevic's regime was ousted four years ago, with moderates and ultra-nationalists battling for pre-eminence in major towns throughout the country. CESID said Nenad Bogdanovic was estimated to have won some 50.8 percent of vote in Belgrade, ahead of the ultranationalist hardliner Aleksandar Vucic of the Serbian Radical party with 48 percent. However, the Radicals' candidate Maja Gojkovic appeared to be heading the polls in Novi Sad, Serbia's second largest city, and the capital of Vojvodina, home to some 26 ethnic communities. But CESID's expert Zoran Lucic said that the difference between Gojkovic and the Democratic party candidate Borislav Novkovic "is so tight. we will have to wait till the last ballot is counted." Such estimates have been echoed by unofficial results presented by the Democratic Party, whose spokesman Marko Djurisic added that reformist candidates have won top posts in a number of smaller towns in Serbia. The Serbian Radical party has so far declined to disclose any of its estimates of the results. Analysts said the elections were important for Serbia's moderates, who dominate on the national level, to be able to implement vital economic and political reforms, and patch up their fraught relations. Turnout was low, however, which analysts attributed to widespread disappointment with the failure of politicians to successfully implement reforms to significantly improve living standards since Milosevic's ouster four years ago. Results for other municipalities in Serbia and the parliament of northern province of Vojvodina were expected overnight. First official results were expected on Monday.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Kerry consoles locked out workers, roasts Bush on economy.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[AUSTINTOWN, Ohio, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democratic hopeful John Kerry tried to wrench the focus of the US election campaign from Iraq to the economy Sunday, as he consoled locked out workers and roasted Republican fiscal policy. Kerry flew into the critical battleground state of Ohio, chasing the shadow of President George W. Bush who visited the state on Saturday to denounce his rival's own economic plan. "You better get elected, we can't take four more years of that whack job," yelled Richard Gonnella, a retired steelworker, as Kerry greeted workers picketing on a crisp fall morning at a titanium plant in Niles, Ohio. "It's up to you," Kerry replied, as he campaigned in a state where most polls give him the thinnest of leads over Bush, who savaged Kerry's own economic plan during a visit to the state on Saturday. No Republican candidate has ever lost Ohio and gone on to take the White House. Kerry is limbering up for Friday's second presidential debate by trying to make the case that Bush's refusal to change course despite worsening conditions in Iraq is replicated in his economic policy. Bush's policies have culled tens of thousands of jobs from the US industrial heartland, Democrats claim. They say the President's tax policies have rewarded the rich at the expense of the poor, exploded the deficit and ripped the heart out of public services. "There is nothing conservative about these people, they are radical, extreme, they have no regard for fiscal responsibility," Kerry told a town hall-style meeting in nearby Austintown. "Stop and think about 270,000 lost jobs in Ohio. stop and think about schools that have after school programs are being cut so that the most powerful people have been taken care of," Kerry said. "We can balance our budget, we can create jobs, we can be fiscally responsible. "We know we can do it because from 1993 until the year 2000 we did exactly that," he said referring to what Democrats see as a golden economic age under former president Bill Clinton. Kerry's campaign is on a high after a Newsweek poll released Saturday found he had wiped out the modest lead Bush held going into last Thursday's first presidential debate. Aides are now awaiting other surveys to find out whether that survey was a blip, or a sign that he had truelly erased the advantage Bush enjoyed ever since the Republican National Convention in early September. Kerry visited the RMI Titanium plant in Niles, Ohio, where 361 workers have been locked out since October 2003, after rejected a contract which called for three million dollars in concessions.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Anger mounts in France over freelance mission to free journalists in Iraq.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[French officials and media expressed anger Sunday at an unofficial mission to free two French journalists taken hostage in Iraq more than six weeks ago which came up empty-handed after promising imminent success. French Justice Minister Dominique Perben accused lawmaker Didier Julia of lacking responsibility, while Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin warned he might have compromised negotiations for the release of the two men. Julia, a member of Parliament belonging to President Jacques Chirac's governing UMP party, arrived in Beirut Thursday evening and was then driven to Damascus, where he and his staff made a series of claims about the imminent release of the two hostages, journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, seized with their Syrian driver on August 20. "We advised (Julia) not to do it but he went ahead anyway," Perben said on French radio. "Overall the effect has been negative and that is very regrettable. It is a lack of a sense of responsibility of this gentleman." In a statement Raffarin called for "a sense of responsibility by everyone" and said "all private initiatives" could create "a threat for our fellow countrymen." Chirac on Saturday slammed the unofficial mission as "interference". The operation has sown confusion and raised many questions over government efforts -- in public and in secret -- to free the two men. Newspapers were contemptuous of the mission's instigators: Julia, a 70-year-old UMP deputy who is vice president of an Iraqi-French Friendship Group and an Arabic speaker with ties to the Middle East; and his field man, a 45-year-old former French navy commando named Philippe Brett who belongs to an association that used to have links to ousted Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. Both Julia and Brett had claimed on Friday that they were within hours of securing the release of the reporters. Brett, in a mobile telephone interview with French radio station Europe 1, had even asserted that he was with the two men but did not pass the handset to either of them. Julia, in the Syrian capital Damascus, later told journalists that a convoy meant to take the hostages out of Iraq on Saturday had turned back before reaching the Syrian border because the US military had opened fire on it. US officials flatly denied the charge. Doubts were raised over whether Brett was actually in Iraq. Julia said he met his associate in a Damascus hotel room before dawn on Saturday, despite the fact that the border is closed at night. It was unclear where Julia and Brett were on Sunday. Julia was originally believed to have left Damascus for Paris, but officials in Beirut's airport said he never made the flight to France. One of Julia's aides said he stayed in Beirut for further contacts, but French ting with Julia early Friday, before the deputy affirmed that the hostages would soon be freed. Le Journal du Dimanche speculated that Julia had been manipulated by the Syrian intelligence services as part of a plot by Damascus to punish France for backing a UN resolution condemning Syrian involvement in Lebanon.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Slovenia's centre-right opposition slightly ahead in vote: partial results (UPDATES).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenia's centre-right opposition was leading in Sunday's national elections with 38 percent of votes compared to the government's 36.99 percent, officials said after 95 percent of votes had been counted. The Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) scored 29.24 percent of votes while its ally, the conservative New Slovenia (NSi) party took 8.8 percent, the commission said. This gave the opposition an estimated 38 seats in the former Yugoslav state's 90-member parliament, compared to 37 for the centre-left coalition of Prime Minister Anton Rop. Rop admitted defeat on Sunday just two hours after polls closed at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT), saying his Liberal Democracy party (LDS) was preparing to become part of the opposition. "Although we have to wait until the end, it seems very likely that the Liberal Democracy party will move to the opposition. We are firmly decided to work hard within the opposition," Rop said. "It is clear that the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) won most of the voters' confidence. The LDS ended second." The electoral commission said that according to the incomplete count, turnout among Slovenia's 1.6 million registered voters appeared to be at 59.6 percent. The close results indicated that neither bloc had taken enough votes to form a government on its own, putting the independent Slovenian Nationalist Party in the position of kingmaker with its estimated 6.3 percent of the vote. Slovenia's President Janez Drnovsek, who has to appoint a candidate to put together a new government, said that if the exit polls proved correct, the lack of a clear majority would make it difficult for him to do so. "If these results prove to be true, it will be harder for me to choose the candidate for creating a new government and he himself (the candidate) will have a tougher task when preparing a coalition," Drnovsek said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An alleged Islamic terrorist cell busted in Britain in August was trying to construct a crude radiological dirty bomb, Time magazine reported Sunday. The report said the arrests, which followed a yearlong surveillance operation code-named Operation Spangle, turned up a cache of household smoke detectors, which the British suspected the group wanted to cannibalize for their minute quantities of americium-241, a man-made radioactive chemical. The magazine quotes unnamed officials as telling it's extremely unlikely that enough americium could be harvested from smoke detectors to create a device potent enough to inflict radiation sickness, let alone kill people. But others argue that spewing even a small amount of radioactive material into a crowded stadium or subway station could trigger sensitive radiation sensors, incite panic and cause long-lasting contamination, the report said. Time quotes law-enforcement officials as saying computer files seized with the group revealed plans for specific attacks in London, including "blowing up high-rise buildings housing multinational companies" by driving bomb-laden cars into underground garages. Other targets included the Heathrow Express, a rail line between the airport and London, and an unspecified synagogue, according to the report. There were also plans for "hijacking a gasoline tanker and smashing it into a building."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Karzai sees Afghan administration stronger after elections.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Afghan President Hamid Karzai expressed confidence Sunday that his administration would emerge from a historic presidential election next weekend with increased legitimacy. Karzai, who was elected by a council of tribal leaders in June 2002 after the Taliban regime was ousted in a US-led invasion, is widely tipped to win the vote on Saturday. Parliamentary elections are due to follow, although no date has yet been set. "Legitimacy will increase tremendously after the elections," Karzai told a press conference after talks with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. "The government will be much more in power in terms of legitimacy but in terms of provision of services and the capability of the Afghan administration it will take some time for the country to do better." Karzai said he hoped for logistical reasons that the presidential election could be settled in a single round. "I hope for all the good reasons that the election will not go to the second round because it will be very expensive for us to have a second round and it will be easier for us to have a result in the first round." Karzai said he saw nothing unusual in the fact that he was in Europe six days before the landmark election rather than campaigning at home. Later Sunday he received a "United We Care" award from the privately funded Werkstatt Deutschland organisation in Berlin, given to personalities who have displayed vision, courage and responsibility in their work. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was given a prize at the same ceremony for his handling of his country's reform process. "Any president would come to receive an award six days before an election," Karzai said after his meeting with Fischer. "It is an honour to receive this award." The remnants of the Taliban regime have regrouped along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan and have warned the people of Afghanistan against voting in the elections. Germany contributes around 2,000 troops to the 9,000-strong NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and the German parliament on Thursday extended the troops' mandate until October 2005. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is due to visit Afghanistan two days after the election on October 11, although government officials have admitted the trip could be cancelled if the violence that has flared ahead of the elections worsens. Karzai admitted he had discussed security for the parliamentary elections with Fischer. "There will be a contribution from NATO and the other members of the international community for the parliamentary elections as well," Karzai said. "But the details of that arrangement are yet to be worked out because we have some time. I hope the joint Afghan-UN election commission will soon announce the date of the parliamentary elections so that preparations can be made for the security of it as well." German troops in a so-called Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) operating in northern Afghanistan were criticised by foreign aid workers for failing to come to their rescue when they came under attack from an angry mob earlier this month. But Karzai said German troops had played an essential role in helping to rebuild Afghanistan. "It has made a lot of difference, in the form of the PRTs, in the form of reconstruction. "Germany has been one of the steadfast, biggest nations supporting Afghanistan," he said. Fischer meanwhile said they had discussed Germany's possible involvement in strengthening the Afghan police force "in the provinces". Many areas of Afghanistan are controlled by regional warlords.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ROME, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Juventus held onto first place in Serie A with an unspectacular 1-0 victory at Udinese on Sunday, but their joy at maintaining the lead in Italy was tempered by a serious injury to striker David Trezeguet. The France international dislocated his shoulder in the narrow win in Udine and was replaced for the start of the second half by Marcelo Zalayeta. And it was the Uruguayan forward who scored the winner on the hour, powerfully heading home Mauro Camoranesi's corner. Unbeaten Juve sit proudly at the top of the table on 13 points, two ahead of surprise package Messina, who were comprehensive 4-1 winners at home to Siena. Andriy Shevchenko scored twice and set up the other goal for Kaka in AC Milan's controversial 3-1 win against Reggina which moved them up to third on 10 points. Palermo, champions of Serie B last season, joined Chievo and Cagliari on nine points after winning 1-0 at home to Bologna. Luigi Del Neri's first game in charge of Roma ended in a thrilling 3-3 draw at home to Inter Milan. Roma were 3-1 down with 54 minutes gone, but showed their new boss they are prepared to scrap for points by fighting back to sneak a draw. Francesco Totti reduced the deficit with his 100th Serie A goal before Daniele De Rossi prodded home from close range to restore equality 16 minutes from time. Roma took an early lead thanks to Vincenzo Montella's crisp volley, only for Esteban Cambiasso to head Inter level before the break. Inter then scored two goals in four minutes through Juan Sebastian Veron's deflected shot and Alvaro Recoba's flashing drive. Del Neri was appointed as Rudi Voller's successor on Wednesday. Despite an impressive recovery, Roma have plenty of ground to make up in the title race having taken just five points from 15. Inter are faring slightly better in ninth place. Elsewhere, two goals in the last 11 minutes gave Sampdoria a 2-0 victory at home to Livorno, Roberto Muzzi's late goal earned Lazio a 1-1 draw at Atalanta and Parma against Fiorentina ended goalless. The loss of Trezeguet clouded Juve's fourth win in five league games. "The news on Trezeguet isn't good and we will decide what to do over the next week," said Juve coach Fabio Capello. "His shoulder popped out and he must decide whether he wants an operation or not. With surgery, he could be out for four months." Arturo Di Napoli scored twice for newly-promoted Sicilian side Messina, who are enjoying their first season back in the top flight after a 39-year absence and have already beaten AC Milan and Roma this season. Defending champions AC Milan's result at the San Siro was not without a huge slice of fortune. With Milan leading 2-1, Marco Borriello headed what looked like a perfectly good equaliser for Reggina only for the referee to rule out his effort for an infringement which only the official saw. The Reggina players were still shaking their heads in disbelief when Shevchenko rammed home his fifth league goal of the season to secure another three precious point in their bid to retain the Scudetto. On Saturday, Chievo extended their unbeaten start and rose to fourth thanks to a 2-1 home victory over Lecce, while Gianfranco Zola inspired Cagliari to the same scoreline at home to Lecce. Zola got Cagliari off the mark in the 13th minute from the penalty spot, before providing the killer pass for Antonio Langella's winner seven minutes from time.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[An official at Fox News Channel said Sunday that one of its political reporters has been disciplined for posting a fake news item on its website about Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Paul Schur, a spokesman for the network, said Fox's chief political correspondent Carl Cameron had been disciplined for posting an item on FoxNews.com that included several made-up quotes attributed to Kerry.

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Disgraced Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan has been punished by being nationally humilliated, US national security couselor Condoleezza Rice said Sunday. Rice was asked on CNN to clarify President George W. Bush's statement during his debate late Thursday with Senator John Kerry that "the A.Q. Khan network has been brought to justice." Khan, the father of his country's nuclear bomb, publicly confessed in February to leaking nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea. But Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who insisted the proliferation was carried out by a handful of scientists without government involvement, has given Khan a conditional pardon. And Pakistan officials have refused agents with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's atomic watchdog agency, access to interview Khan to discuss the international black market he used to run. Khan is "a particular kind of figure in Pakistani lore, a national hero, and Musharraf has dealt with what is a very difficult situation" by "making certain that he's out of business," said Rice. Khan has lost privileges "to travel and the like," said Rice, and "a number of countries are pursuing prosecutions" of network members, she added, mentioning South Africa and at least one unnamed European country. "A.Q. Khan, in a sense, has been brought to justice because he is out of the business that he loved most," said Rice. "And if you don't think that his national humiliation is justice for what he did, I think it is. He's nationally humiliated.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The trial in Equatorial Guinea of 19 people including 14 suspected mercenaries accused of plotting to overthrow President Teodoro Obian Nguema will not resume on Monday as previously announced, sources there said. Eight South Africans, six Armenians and five Equato-Guineans, including a former deputy minister, went on trial in Malabo in August for allegedly plotting to oust Obiang, who has ruled the small central African country since 1979. The case was adjourned on August 31 at the request of the state's attorney general, Jose Olo Obono, to get "further information" following the arrest of Mark Thatcher in South Africa. The son of the former British prime minister is suspected by Equatorial Guinea and South Africa of financing the alleged plot. The lawyer for the South African defendants recently told AFP that the trial would resume on October 4. No official confirmation was available. Olo Obono could not be reached in Malabo in recent days. Thatcher was arrested in South Africa, where he lives, and the Pretoria government has given permission for questions to be put to him on behalf of Equatorial Guinea's prosecutor's office. That hearing had been set for September 22 but has been postponed until November 26.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEATTLE, Washington, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A tremor shook Mount St. Helens for 25 minutes early Sunday, prompting scientists to warn of an imminent second two days after the volcano came back to life. The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the volcano, which killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980, was shaken by a "tremor burst" for 25 minutes. Eathquakes are rumbling at a rate of one or two per minute, it added. Scientists on Saturday saw an increase of fumaroles, a hole from which hot gases and vapors emanate, in St. Helens' lava dome and detected carbon dioxide, the USGS said. After 18 years on inactivity, St. Helens roared back to life Friday with a giant plume of steam and ash. "All this suggests that a second eruption is imminent," said USGS spokeswoman Catherine Puckett. "It could happen right now while we are talking, in the next few hours or tomorrow." Friday's eruption brought hundreds of curiosity seekers to the area who were evacuated on Saturday from a five-mile (8 kilometer) radius around the mountain, including the USGS Johnson Ridge Observatory. The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday warned aircraft to avoid the area around the volcano. The USGS has raised its alert to the maximum third level. Volcano experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St. Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew. "This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's Stephanie Hanna said Friday when St. Helens erupted. On May 18, 1980, after weeks of quakes, slides and tremors, of belching smoke, steam and ash, Mount St. Helens, a major peak in the Cascade mountain chain, erupted. Sandy McComb, 56, of Portland, Oregon, 60 miles (100 km) south, helped in search and rescue operations after St. Helens' devastating eruption, and she came to see the volcano come back to life this weekend. "We had to come back here when this happened," she said. The 1980 erupts erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the same intensity. Although geologists said the probability for another eruption is high, they predict it would not be anything like that of 1980.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[French police on Sunday detained three activists from the Greenpeace environmental group who were protesting at the planned arrival of a shipment of weapons-grade plutonium in this northern port, maritime police said. Among those arrested was the well-known French yachtsman Eugene Riguidel, whose sailboat was impounded by the police. The activists were part of a flotilla sent out to protest the arrival of the nuclear waste from the United States to the French port of Cherbourg. They were due to be freed on Monday, according to Greenpeace, which staged a protest in Cherbourg to demand their release. Two vessels carrying a shipment of 140 kilograms (308 pounds) of plutonium from US weapons arsenals left North Carolina on September 20 and were expected to dock in Cherbourg over the weekend. Greenpeace activists had sent out two ships, and a flotilla of a dozen smaller boats to protest their arrival. A Greenpeace spokesman in Cherbourg said he now expected the shipment to arrive late Monday or early Tuesday. The plutonium is to be taken to the French nuclear reconditioning station at La Hague, then sent to a facility in southern France to be recycled and eventually returned for civilian use in the United States. The US government has said the plutonium was being transported by sea as a one-off exercise. Greenpeace said the long distances of road transport involved constituted a "considerable" risk, not least because the cargo's containers could easily be opened by shoulder-launched rockets. Cogema, the French state nuclear company, issued a statement rejecting the charges, saying the transport of plutonium was carried out with "all safety guarantees" and that the truck convoy would be unmarked to avoid attracting attention.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Colin Powell arrives in Brazil on Monday to thank President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for his leadership on issues like Haiti, democracy in Venezuela and the region, a sign that a mature bilateral relationship has overcome recent spats. Powell arrives late Monday in Sao Paulo, where he will speak with business leaders and students. On Tuesday around midday, he will meet Lula and Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. He leaves early Wednesday for the Caribbean. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that the leaders will "discuss the strength and the depth of our relationship." He said Powell's discussions would cover "a number of issues like the situation in Venezuela, our appreciation for the effort that Brazil is making in Haiti, and cooperation together on security issues including in Brazil's current membership of the Security Council and other issues like trade and common interest in global issues." Since Lula became president on January 1, 2003, Brazil has taken on a regional leadership role. Brazil form 1, 2005. The two countries came to loggerheads over a US decision to fingerprint travelers from various countries, including Brazil. Brazil, which bases its foreign policy on reciprocity, did the same for US citizens. Brasilia and Washington also seem to have reached an agreement on inspection of a Brazilian uranium enrichment plant. Brasilia has so far denied the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency access to the plant and appears close to allowing the UN agency inside. Powell's trip to Brazil will "show the flag, give a sign that the United States appreciates its relationship with Brazil and to a certain point to commemorate the fact that relations between the United States and Brazil have gotten much better," said Miguel Diaz, South America director for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank.]]></c>

Carteron made a needless foul on the edge of the box, a very unadvisable thing to do with a player like Juninho around, leaving the Brazilian with another attempt after 34 minutes. This time Juninho was spot on. He curled a right-footed shot over the wall and into the left hand side of goal, leaving Janot completely wrongfooted. Three minutes after the break, St Etienne were back on level terms. Lyon keeper Gregory Coupet punched away a corner and the ball eventually found Ilunga who hit a powerful shot between Lyon defenders and Nicolas Marin deflected the ball into the goal. Just after Lyon's Malouda and Mahamadou Diarra both had attempts in a matter of seconds, St Etienne scored their second goal. From a David Hellebuyck freekick, Pascal Feindouno connected with a superb header which beat Coupet and the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium exploded into celebration. Lyon found themselves having conceded two goals in a quarter-hour period though they had only let in three in their previous eight league matches this season. Then came Juninho's equalising penalty scored on the second attempt in the 88th minute. Janot, diving to his right, saved brilliantly but Juninho was alert to slot home the rebound before Janot jumped two-footed against his own post in comical fashion in exasperation. Govou then hit his powerful, injury time winner for Lyon before St Etienne's Hognon saw a volley attempt with his right leg outstretched sail just over the crossbar.]]></c>

Barca go twith an effort from Brazilian defender Iuliano Belletti after 76 minutes going over the crossbar. Two minutes into extra time Numancia had a chance to take a point but missed a corner, as Deco hit just wide before the whistle in what was the hosts last chance of a second goal. Valencia, hit after inspirational left winger Vicente Rodriguez was ruled out for two weeks with a sprained left ankle, failed to fire. After taking the lead after 10 minutes when Italian marksman Marco Di Vaio scored his fifth goal of the season Valencia failed to find any inspiration, with Brazilian Edu grabbing the equaliser after 30 minutes following a pass from Valencia reject Ricardo Oliveira.

		<t><![CDATA[Brazilians head to polls in mid-term test for Lula (UPDATES with exit poll results).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRASILIA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Brazilians voted Sunday in local elections for mayors and city councilors in a key mid-term test for leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Results for major cities and state capitals were expected around 9 pm (0001 GMT), while returns from 90 percent of the country were expected by 11 pm (0200 GMT), according to election officials. Lula cast his ballot shortly after polls opened in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city where one of the most closely watched mayoral battles was being fought. Marta Suplicy, from Lula's Workers' Party, was running against Jose Serra from the Brazilian Social Democratic Party. Both candidates were tied with 40 percent of the vote, according to a voter exit poll by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics (IBOPE) -- meaning that they will go for a runoff election on October 31. An earlier poll put Serra comfortably ahead of Suplicy in a theoretical second round vote. The election is a comeback effort for Serra, who lost the 2002 presidential race to Lula, but who is tipped as a possible contender in the next polls in 2006. "A victory for Serra will demonstrate that the opposition is alive and well and the Workers' Party can't sell the idea of an automatic win for Lula," said political consultant Jose Luciano Dias. Lula-backed candidates were winning handily in the state capitals of Belo Horizonte and Recife, acording to Ibope. But in Rio de Janeiro, the country's second largest city, incumbent mayor Cesar Maia from the opposition Liberal Front Party seemed heading for reelection, according to exit polls. Run-offs will be held in any of the 68 cities that have at least 200,000 registered voters where no candidate obtains an absolute majority in the first round. Analysts will be measuring whether Lula's party benefited at the local level from his popularity and encouraging economic news, with an eye on his chances for re-election in 2006. Lula came to power in January 2002 promising greater social justice and remains personally popular. On becoming president, the former union firebrand answered the fears of international investors by establishing an austerity policy in a bid to control spending. Brazil is on track for growth of four to five percent this year following a recession of 0.2 percent in 2003. Unemployment was trimmed from 13.1 percent in April to 11.4 percent in August. Election day began smoothly, after a candidate was killed Saturday and a bomb was found outside Sao Paulo. In the town of Redentora in Rio Grande do Sul state on the border with Uruguay and Argentina, city council candidate Antonio Euribides da Silva, 56, was shot and killed at dawn Saturday as he drove along a rural road outside of town, police said. Da Silva, of the ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement coalition, was seeking a sixth consecutive term as city councilman. He has for the past 20 years been president of the town's rural workers union. Another politician traveling with him at the time was unhurt. And in the Sao Paulo port suburb of Santos, three sticks of dynamite wired to a detonator were found and disarmed in a small hotel, along with a crude map designating the local storage site for some of the electronic voting machines to be used in Sunday's election. Voting is mandatory in Brazil. Results will be available quickly due to the use of 406,000 electronic voting machines in 359,326 polling stations. Nearly 120 million voters were to cast ballots throughout the day for 5,563 mayors and more than 51,000 councilors.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenia's centre-right opposition coalition on Sunday won a narrow upset victory in national elections five months after the former Yugoslav state joined the European Union. The Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) and its ally, the conservative New Slovenia (NSi) party, had taken 38 percent of the vote compared to the governing centre-left coalition's 37 percent, the electoral commission said after 99 percent of votes were counted. The SDS-led group would take 38 seats in the 90-member parliament, while 37 seats would go to the three parties that make up the government. Prime Minister Anton Rop's Liberal Democracy party (LDS), which has held power in the former Yugoslav state for nearly 12 years, managed to take only 22.8 percent. The prime minister admitted defeat not long after voting closed at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT). "It seems very likely that the Liberal Democracy party (LDS) will move to the opposition. We are firmly decided to work hard within the opposition," Rop said. The election commission said just over 60 percent of some 1.6 million registered voters had cast their ballots. Analysts have said the right-wing has managed to eat into the prime minister's support in the past year and a half by challenging it on issues with a nationalist undertone. These include a row about building a mosque in the capital Ljubljana, and a referendum on restoring citizenship to some 18,000 members of fellow former Yugoslav states that were wiped off the register when the communist federation boke up. Sunday's close results mean that neither bloc had taken enough votes to form a government on its own, putting the independent Slovenian Nationalist Party in the position of kingmaker with its estimated 6.3 percent of the vote. Slovenia's President Janez Drnovsek, who has to appoint a candidate to put together a new government, had earlier said that if exit polls proved correct, the lack of a clear majority would make it difficult for him to do so. "If these results prove to be true, it will be harder for me to choose the candidate for creating a new government and he himself (the candidate) will have a tougher task when preparing a coalition," Drnovsek said. Coalition talks were meant to start on Monday in Slovenia, the most prosperous of the new states which joined the European Union in May. SDS leader Janez Jansa has said that he wants a "sufficient majority" that would allow the centre-right to shake up politics in the tiny Alpine state of two million people. "We in fact need a really good result in order to change Slovenian politics. Wide coalitions usually mean. inefficient rule," he said at a polling station in Ljubljana's Grosuplje suburb. Voting took place against the backdrop of a limited journalists' strike and a new twist in the country's troubled relations with neighbouring Croatia. Zagreb chose election day to create a protected fishing and ecological area off its Adriatic coast, which Slovenia has complained would leave it without access to international shipping waters. Rop's handling of long-standing territorial disputes with Croatia has been criticised by the SDS in the election campaign, along with his handling of the economy, road infrastructure problems and pension issues. The prime minister, who led the country into the EU and NATO this year, has countered that his government helped to set Slovenia on the path of becoming one of the EU's most developed countries. The right-wing, which holds four out of Slovenia's seven seats in the European parliament, is considered pro-Europe and unlikely to change policies towards Brussels.]]></c>

The 1980 eruption blew off the upper third of the mountain, leaving a gaping crater 2,050-foot (400-meter) deep, 1.7-mile (2.7-km) long and 1.3-mile (2-km) wide. The explosions shaved off 400 meters (1,300 feet) of the mountain's top, reducing it from 2,950 meters (9,680 feet) to 2,549 meters (8,363 feet). The blast sent clouds of volcanic ash high into the atmosphere, where jet streams carried it as far as the US eastern seaboard 3,000 miles (4,800 km) away. Towns and cities throughout the Pacific Northwest were buried in gray ash. The flash snow melt on the mountain triggered floods and mudslides, sending streams and rivers over their banks and destroying infrastructure for hundreds of miles around. The Columbia River, the main inland shipping channel from the Pacific Ocean, was clogged with volcanic sediment and eventually had to be dredged. Molten lava flows devastated forests and mountain meadows, creating a vast wasteland of mud, magma and ash. Mount St. Helens erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the same intensity. Although geologists said the probability for another eruption is high, they predict it would not be anything like that of 1980.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BELGRADE, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Pro-Western reformers and hardliners both scored major victories Sunday in the first local elections in Serbia since nationalist strongman Slobodan Milosevic was ousted four years. Analysts said the results of the run-off elections showed that the Balkans country remains deeply divided between moderate reformers and hardline nationalists, a division which has hampered attempts to push through economic and political reforms. The elections were seen as important for Serbia's moderates, who dominate on the national level, to be able to implement vital economic and political reforms, and patch up their fraught relations. "Serbia is still divided between reformers and nationalists," said journalist Stojan Cerovic. "Political and economic reforms launched four years ago (after Milosevic's fall) although slower than expected, could halt completely if the Radicals come to power," analyst Divna Vukomanovic told AFP. Nenad Bogdanovic, the reformist candidate of President Boris Tadic's Democratic Party won the influential post of Belgrade mayor in run-off elections, estimates based on early vote counting showed. However, Maja Gojkovic, a former Milosevic loyalist, appeared to be in the lead to take Novi Sad, the capital of the ethnically-mixed northern Vojvodina province, according to the estimates by the non-governmental monitoring group CESID. But CESID's expere unable to form a government. The Democrats suffered a blow losing control in Serbia's third largest city Nis, but analysts warned that such outcome could be blamed to a lack of support from other members of the reformist bloc. "We expected other reformist parties would call its supporters to back the Democratic party's candidates, but obviously, this support was absent." Marko Blagojevic of CESID told AFP. The forces of reformist Tadic and moderate nationalist Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica joined ranks following the September 19 first round in a bid to defeat the Radicals. This is the first such deal between the moderate parties since Tadic was elected president in June, but the fraught relations between the two camps may make its application difficult. Tadic warned on Sunday a victory for the Radicals would hurt Serbia in its relations abroad. "Our relations with the world are fragile and we need to strengthen them. Without partner relations with big powers, Serbia can not fight for its legitimate national interests, wherever they might be in danger," Tadic said. And in Vojvodina's provincial parliament, unofficial estimates showed that the seats would be tightly split between reformers and ultranationalists. Ethnically-mixed Vojvodina, in the north of Serbia, which has recently seen violence between the ethnic Serb and ethnic Hungarian communities, tensions have remained high since Radical candidate took the lead in the first round of voting on September 19. Turnout was low, however, which analysts attributed to widespread disappointment with the failure of politicians to successfully implement reforms to significantly improve living standards since Milosevic's ouster four years ago. First official results were expected on Monday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Janez Jansa, the leader of the centre-right opposition Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), on Sunday was set to crown a political career spanning two decades by taking over Slovenia's government. Jansa, a 46-year-old father of two, cut his teeth in politics while studying military theory at Ljubljana University's Sociology Faculty when the country was still part of the former Yugoslavia. He was expelled from the Socialist Youth Organisation for repeatedly criticising the way in which the communist federation's army was run and arrested by the military along with three fellow reform-minded Slovenians. They were sentenced to prison in 1988 in the so-called "Trial against four" which increased tension between Slovenes and the centralised army, controlled by the federal government in Belgrade. Massive protests forced Belgrade to release the four in 1989. At the time, the Slovenian Communist party was pushing for general political reform of Yugoslavia and clashing with the communists from Serbia and Montenegro who opposed change. Jansa later headed the territorial defense forces that successfully resisted the Yugoslav army in Slovenia's struggle for independence in 1991. As a member of the Democratic Changes coalition (DEMOS), he became a member of Slovenia's first democratically elected parliament and was appointed defense minister. In 1994, he left the defense ministry under a cloud for allegedly authorising actions by the military against the interior ministry. Jansa took over the defense ministry again for six months in 2000 as a member of a temporary centre-right government headed by Andrej Bajuk. In 1993 he became the president of the former Social Democratic Party and has continued to lead the party after it recently changed its name and joined the European People's Party. After years as opposition leader with limited power in parliament, Jansa's influence grew in June when the SDS and its ally New Slovenia (NSi) won the European parliamentary elections, taking four of the seven seats Slovenia holds in the Parliament. Despite the increase of support for the SDS over the last year, Jansa -- a keen golfer and surfer with a cold smile -- has never managed to become very popular with the public but has earned the respect of his political opponents.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Already scrambling to make up ground lost after last week's debate, US President George W. Bush's campaign was forced further on the defensive Sunday by a report that the White House knew before invading Iraq that key intelligence on the country's alleged nuclear weapons program was questionable. National security adviser Condoleezza Rice said Sunday she knew of a debate within the US government about the purpose of aluminum tubes found in Iraq, which she and other officials had brandished before the war as proof of Saddam Hussein's nuclear ambitions. In a series of television interviews Sunday, Rice insisted, however, that she only later learned that the Energy Department believed the aluminum tubes were actually meant for conventional weapons, denying a New York Times report that she knew of those concerns before weilding the tubes as evidence in her argument for war. "At that time we understood there were some debates within the intelligence community. I later learned that the Energy Department believed that these tubes might be for something else," she told NBC television's "Today" show. Speaking on the campaign trail in the town of Austintown, Ohio, Sunday, Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerrl, extreme, they have no regard for fiscal responsibility," Kerry told a town hall-style meeting in Austintown. "Stop and think about 270,000 lost jobs in Ohio. stop and think about schools that have after-school programs are being cut so that the most powerful people have been taken care of," Kerry said. Kerry's strong performance in Thursday's debate with Bush on international affairs, combined with weekend polls showing Kerry with a slim advantage over Bush after trailing him for weeks, have reinvigorated the Democrat's bid for office. On Tuesday, Kerry's running mate, North Carolina Senator John Edwards, faces Vice President Dick Cheney in a 90-minute debate on the campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. The charismatic Edwards, a former trial lawyer, will sit across a table from Cheney, a serious, often dour conservative with a quick wit and sharp tongue. A television journalist will moderate the event. Kerry and Bush in the meantime arrry. "It was a guy who was clear, who was consistent, and the president didn't have an answer."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[China, invited to the table of the world's top financial powers for the first time, did not appear to buckle to pressure to speed up moves to adjust or end a currency peg that many say distorts global trade flows. After China joined the Group of Seven economic powers over the weekend for the first time, a central bank official said there was no timetable to make the yuan exchange rate more flexible. In a speech to a banking group in Washington Sunday, Li Ruogu, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said Beijing would move to a more flexible exchange rate for the yuan "when conditions permit." Li said: "We have already sreally don't see any help if you force China to change the exchange rate and help the US economy. You are exercising something to destroy the goose that can give you golden eggs." China was invited to join finance ministers and central bankers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States at a dinner Friday after a scheduled G7 meeting amounted to belated recognition of Beijing's undeniable weight in the world economy. At the meeting and in subsequent sessions of the IMF and World Bank, the Chinese came under renewed pressure allow their currency, the yuan, to float freely. The yuan has been pegged at roughly 8.3 yuan to the dollar since 1994, and the peg has become a politically sensitive topic in the United States and elsewhere, with some saying the currency is artificially low, boosting China's exports at the expense of other nations. The IMF and World Bank suggested that flexible currencies would held reduce the massive imbalances in tshed after its brakes failed in the Belgrade suburb of Banovo Brdo, the agency said, adding that the driver had warned passangers to jump out from the vehicle. Firemen spent almost an hour to cut open the vehicle to pull out the injured. Two victims who had been seriously injured were hospitalized, while the others were sent home after medical treatment, Beta news agency added.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[African finance ministers voiced optimism Sunday about what they said was fresh momentum on the part of Western nations toward easing the multilateral debt burden carried by the poorest countries. The assessment came at the end of a weekend meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund where ministers and central bankers talked extensively about debt relief but took no concrete action. Speaking of the debt owed by poor nations -- and those in Africa in particular -- to multilateral bodies such as the Bank and the Fund, Malawi Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe said "our understanding is that ideas are travelling forward on dealing with that." "They are being put forward by some very powerful people in the (IMF-World Bank) membership," he said, adding: "We are extremely expectant something will come out of it. We feel very confident that it (forgiveness of multilateral debt) will be accepted quickly as a matter of policy." Appearing at a press conference with Gondwe, Gabon Finance Minister Paul Toungui said "what we see as a positive point is that. there are now new ideas circulating." "We don't have a preference for one or the other. We think that all the ideas should be put together." The approaches under consideration have been backed most notably by the United States, Britain and France. Washington has proposed a combination of debt relief of up to 100 percent and grants from international financial institutions. Britain has suggested that the IMF's massive gold stock, currently valued at 8.5 billion dollars on the basis of historical cost, could be assessed at current market price, which would give it a value of 42.2 billion dollars, a step that would help the IMF offer debt relief to the poorest countries. In addition, Britain on its own has pledged to pay the share -- 10 percent -- of debt owed to the World Bity for moving forward is ours."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[IMF must say 'no' to some countries in crisis: Rato by Laura Bonilla (ADDS details, background).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The International Monetary Fund has to learn to say "no" in some cases to crisis-stricken countries to force them toward better economic policies, the IMF's top official said Sunday. Managing Director Rodrigo Rato acknowledged the role of the fund as a lender of last resort and said this has helped many countries pull of out crises in recent years, including South Korea, Mexico, Turkey and Brazil. But in remarks to the annual plenary meetings of the World Bank and IMF, Rato said there were times when the Fund must take a tougher approach to help countries in need. "The IMF's loans to Mexico in 1995, to Korea in 1997, and the support in recent years to Brazil and Turkey, are some of the examples from the recent past where large-scale support was appropriate," he said. "That said, we also need a Fund that can say 'no.' The prospect of the fund declining to provide financial support would strengthen the incentives to implement sound policies, thus avoiding the need for fund support in the first place." Rato did not rule out further economic bailouts, although his comments suggested these must face close scrutiny. "However good our surveillance is, crises will not disappear, and the fund will be called upon to help mitigate their impact," he said. "As shown by recent programs, the fund stands ready to assist members facing temporary financial difficulties. Over the last decade, this crisis resolution has sometimes required the commitment of substantial amounts of fund resources. In most cases, this commitment has paid off: it has supported strong stabilization and reform programs and helped to limit or avoid contagion." Rato notably avoided any reference to Argentina, where a multibillion-dollar aid package failed to prevent an economic meltdown, and where the IMF is still grappling with authorities on economic reforms before releasing new aid. Argentina was a former model pupil of the IMF until its spectacular collapse in December 2001 that led to the resignation of president Fernando de la Rua and a default on the nation's bonds that remains unresolved. The IMF's Independent Evaluation Office said in a July report that part of the blame for the crisis rested with the fund, which failed to confront the risks presented by Argentina's policy of fixing the peso's exchange rate at one-to-one to the dollar, and by giving repeated waivers as the country missed targets to curb debt every year from 1994. Rato's tough-love message appeared to echo the concerns of former US treasury secretary Paul O'Neill, who in 2002 argued that bailouts served mainly to help speculators. But the IMF, with US support, ended up backing a record 30.4 billion-dollar aid package for Brazil in 2002 followed by a 6.6 billion-dollar supplemental package in 2003, although Brazilian authorities have not recently drawn from the program.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Slovenia's centre-right claims upset election win, promises change.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenia's centre-right opposition coalition on Sunday won a narrow upset victory in the first national elections since the former Yugoslav republic joined the EU, ending 12 years of nearly continuous control by liberals. The Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) and their ally, the conservative New Slovenia (NSi) party, took 38 percent of the vote compared to the outgoing centre-left coalition's 37 percent, the electoral commission said after 99 percent of votes were counted. The SDS-led group would take 38 seats in the 90-member parliament and three parties that up the government, 37 seats. After Prime Minister Anton Rop admitted defeat, SDS leader Janez Jansa said if called upon to form the next government he would pursue a "new policy" domestically but keep foreign policy in the new EU and NATO member on course. "Slovenia stepped today on a new way. that new policy, if we get to create the new government, will be a policy of continuity for all the good things done so far, and a policy of changes where the managing of the state was not aimed at progress." "Our foreign policy will be based on our alliances, the relations we recently established and which grant us our future." Rop's Liberal Democracy party (LDS), which has held power in the former Yugoslav state for nearly 12 years, managed to take only 22.82 percent. The prime minister saw the writing on the wall shortly after voting closed at 7:00 pm (1700 GMT), telling journalists: "It seems very likely that the Liberal Democracy party (LDS) will move to the opposition. We are firmly decided to work hard within the opposition." The election commission said just over 60 percent of some 1.6 million registered voters had cast their ballots. Coalition talks were meant to start on Monday, but the close result means that neither bloc had taken enough votes to form a government on its own. Slovenia's President Janez Drnovsek, who has to appoint a candidate to put together a new government, earlier Sunday predicted the lack of a clear majority will make his task difficult. "It will be harder for me to choose the candidate for creating a new government and he himself (the candidate) will have a tougher task when preparing a coalition," Drnovsek said. Analysts have said the centre-right managed to exploit general weariness with the long LDS rule as well as to eat into the prime minister's support in the past year and a half by challenging it on issues with a nationalist undertone. These include a row about building a mosque in the capital Ljubljana, and a referendum on restoring citizenship to some 18,000 people which hailed from other former Yugoslav states that were wiped off the register when the communist federation boke up.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[PM Rop led Slovenia into EU only to fail in first post-entry election.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LJUBLJANA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Slovenia's Prime Minister Anton Rop was forced Sunday to admit defeat in national elections only five months after leading the former Yugoslav state into the European Union. "It seems very likely that the Liberal Democracy party (LDS) will move to the opposition. We are firmly decided to work hard within the opposition," Rop said after partial results put the centre-right opposition in a narrow lead. It was Rop's first test at the polls as frontman of the centre-left Slovenian Liberal Democracy (LDS) party after taking over as prime minister and party president two years ago when Janez Drnovsek resigned both jobs to become the country's president. "These elections are the first ones at which I run for the prime minister's post," he had said at the end of his campaign. Unlike Drnovsek, Rop is not a "veteran" of the Slovenian independence process that drove the tiny Alpine state away from former Yugoslavia in 1991. Though some analysts believed it would be an advantage in the elections as Slovenians were keen to replace the independence "veterans", public weariness with the party that has led Slovenia for 12 years, won out. Soon after graduating from Ljubljana University's Economy faculty in 1984, Rop started working at the government's Macroeconomic Studies and Development Institute. He earned a masters degree in economics in 1991. Rop went on to become state secretary of the economy ministry in Janez Drnovsek's first government and helped to launch Slovenia's privatisation process. He was labour minister in Drnovsek's second government, from 1996 to 2000, and became finance minister in the third LDS government after the 2000 elections. In this post he made the privatisation of state-owned banks a priority. In December 2002, Rop took over as prime minister, landing the honour of formally taking Slovenia into the EU and NATO. As a trained economist, Rop has kept a tight rein on the economy since 2000. But he has been accused of neglecting foreign policy, especially when it comes to the country's territorial disputes with neighbouring Croatia and domestic issues related to the coalition or public opinion. Such mistakes already cost him dearly in June's elections for the European parliament, saw the People's Party quit his coalition last spring and drove him into open conflict with his former foreign minister Dimitrij Rupel, who switched sides two months before the elections and joined the opposition.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Sidney Govou scored an injury-time winner for Lyon in a topsy-turvy 3-2 victory over St Etienne to shoot them into second spot in the French league table behind Lille on Sunday night. Lille had earned a laborious 1-0 victory at Rennes through a Matt Moussilou goal to give them 19 points with Lyon, two points ahead of Monaco, who lost 4-3 at home to Nice on Saturday. Auxerre and Marseille are fourth and fifth on 16 points. St Etienne coach Elie Baup fielded a defence of Herita Ilunga, Vincent Hognon, Zoumana Camara and Patrice Carteron in front of keeper Jeremie Janot, plus a five-man midfield behind sole striker Frederic Piquionne. Baup's opposite number at Lyon Paul Le Guen had a similar 4-5-1 system with Govou and Florent Malouda on the flanks trying to set up sole striker Sylvain Wiltord. "We had a good first half and were the logical leaders but in the second half we were too cautious and satisfied with holding on to the ball," said Le Guen. "We lacked agression but once we were behind we didn't give up and found the reserves. I'm very happy with the team spirit." Baup said: "It's very frustrating, unfair. We're still learning and paid the price for that. Our team is young and coming from the second division. We have to learn from this." Juninho Pernambucano gave a hint of things to come when, from a freekick, he forced a superb, finger-tip save from Janot in the 18th minute. Carteron made a needless foul on the edge of the box, a very unadvisable thing to do with a player like Juninho around, leaving the Brazilian with another attempt after 34 minutes. This time Juninho was spot on. He curled a right-footed shot over the wall and into the left hand side of goal, leaving Janot completely wrongfooted. Three minutes after the break, St Etienne were back on level terms. Lne's Hognon saw a volley attempt with his right leg outstretched sail just over the crossbar.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[IMF head sees no consensus on demand by poor countries for a greater voice.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Developing countries are agitating for greater decision-making power in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, but the head of the IMF acknowledged Sunday that political consensus on the question was lacking. IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato told the annual general meeting here of both the Fund and the Bank that it was essential that "we. continue to find ways to guarantee that the voices of all our member governments are heard." Rato told the gathering that the IMF had "to maintain a consensus approach to decision-making" and "ensure representation of all regions and countries on the IMF's staff." "Many members want deeper progress on issues of voice and participation that would take into account changes happening in the world, he said. But he added that changes in individual country quotas and voting shares, as sought by developing nations, "will require a political consensus, which is not yet evident." The issue could come to a head next year when the term of World Bank President James Wolfensohn comes to an end. While the head of the bank has traditionally been an American, developing countries are now insisting that the choice of Wolfensohn's successor -- if he is not given another term -- should be open to candidates from everywhere. "A good deal of the policy issues (at the IMF) are on Africa," noted Malawi Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe. "If the IMF and the World Bank are going to be effective it's important that they do hear an African point of view," he said, adding that at IMF headquarters in Washington there should be more African representatives "talking about the reality of Africa." He pointed out that on the 24-member IMF executive board there are nine directors for Europe and just two from Africa. Developing countries in an association known as the Group of 24 on Friday chastised the IMF and the World Bank for what they said had been their failure to give them a greater voice in the two bodies. The ministers in a statement recalled that at an international conference in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002 there was agreement that developing countries were entitled to a higher profile in the IMF and World Bank. But they voiced "strong disappointment and concern that, after two and a half years, no progress has been made on the issues of increasing basic votes and revising the quotas of developing countries in the IMF and their capital shares in the World Bank." They warned that "the current under-representation of developing countries in the decision-making process undermines the credibility and legitimacy (of the fund and the bank) and puts their relevance into question." A country's voting power, as well as its financial commitment, in the IMF is determined by its economic posit. And this introduces an enormous bias against the developing world."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Montreal Expos professional baseball era ended on a sad note as Todd Zeile smacked three-run homer to lead the New York Mets to a 8-1 victory here on Sunday. Montreal will move to Washington, D.C. next season after 36 years in Canada's Quebec province. They finished in last place with a 67-95 record and concluded with an all-time mark of 2,755-2,943. "The name 'Montreal Expos' will not be used again. It's a rude awakening," Montreal manager Frank Robinson said. "It's a sad situation because people in Montreal are losing a team. It's a shame it didn't work out." It ended where it began in New York's Shea Stadium. Montreal entered Major League Baseball with an 11-10 victory over the Mets at Shea Stadium on April 8, 1969. Montreal had far less offence in its final game as Tom Glavine (11-14) pitched six strong innings, allowing one run and three hits. American Brad Wilkerson said the news is not all bad. "It's both special and sad at the same time," Montreal first baseman Brad Wilkerson said. Dodgers pitcher Eric Gagne, who grew up in Montreal, said the Expos demise will be felt more than just on the field. Gagne is afraid the decision will also mean less young players playing baseball in Montreal. "It is sad," Gagne said. "I can't tell you how many Expos games I went to when I was a kid. "It is going to be hard for the economy and hard for the people in Montreal and everyone needs to realize that."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Japan's deflation-fighting efforts are bearing fruit, Finance Minister Sadakazu Tanigaki said Sunday, while pledging further reforms to support the recovery in the world's number-two economy. "The Japanese government has made every effort to overcome prolonged deflation and revitalize the economy through reforms in the financial sector, as well as in regulatory, expenditure and tax policies, and these efforts are gradually paying off," Tanigaki told the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. "The economic recovery led by domestic private demand is expected to continue. Our government views the current recovery as a good opportunity to make further strides in structural reforms, which would lead to sustainable economic growth." The IMF's latest report predicted Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 4.4 percent in 2004, topping the Group of Seven. The IMF also said it sees an end to the protracted deflation experienced in Japan next year, with core price changes from year-earlier levels at "about zero during 2005." In July, Japan's core consumer price index was down 0.2 percent from a year earlier. Tanigaki said that even though deflation looks to be beaten, authorities will remain vigilant. "The Bank of Japan (BoJ) continues to provide ample liquidity under its commitment to maintain the current quantitative easing framework until the year-on-year change in the consumer price index registers zero percent or higher on a sustainable basis," he said. "While persistent deflationary pressure has eased, overcoming deflation remains high on the policy agenda. Therefore, the government and the BoJ will continue to join together to ensure overcoming deflation during Fiscal 2005 and 2006, periods defined as the 'Concentrated Consolidation Period.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Real Madrid's troubled season plunged further into crisis Sunday as the star-studded Spanish outfit lost 0-1 at home to Deportivo La Coruna. It was the third Primera Liga defeat of the season for 29-time Spanish champions Real who are now seven points behind leaders Barcelona in tenth position after this Bernabeu loss. Earlier, a late goal after 70 minutes from Barcelona's former Celtic favourite Henrik Larsson fired the Catalan outfit to the top of the Primera Liga with a 1-0 win at the Nou Camp against newly-promoted Numancia. Barca go two points clear of champions Valencia who drew 1-1 at Real Betis. Deportivo's Spanish international striker Albert Luque struck at the stroke of half time when he chipped over Iker Casillas in goal for just their second win of the season. Real's stars were whistled off the pitch after a lacklustre performance. Newly-signed Liverpool star Michael Owen started up front in the absence of Ronaldo but he was replaced on 52 minutes by Fernando Morientes, with his lack of play now putting his place in Sven-Goran Eriksson's England squad in danger. England captain David Beckham was Real's best performer on the night, as Frenchman Zinedine Zidane failed to impress, missing a late chance to equalise just before the final whistle. In Italy, Juventus held onto first place in Serie A with an unspectacular 1-0 victory at Udinese, but their joy at maintaining the lead in Italy was tempered by a serious injury to striker David Trezeguet. The France international dislocated his shoulder and was replaced for the start of the second half by Marcelo Zalayeta. And it was the Uruguayan forward who scored the winner on the hour, powerfully heading home Mauro Camoranesi's corner. Unbeaten Juve sit at the top of the table on 13 points, two ahead of surprise package Messina, who were comprehensive 4-1 winners at home to Siena. But the loss of Trezeguet clouded Juve's fourth win in five league games. "The news on Trezeguet isn't good and we will decide what to do over the next week," said Juve coach Fabio Capello. "His shoulder popped out and he must decide whether he wants an operation or not. With surgery, he could be out for four months." In Germany Bayern Munich underlined their determination to wrestle the German crown back from Werder Bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the Weserstadion on Saturday. Bayern had not won in Bremen since December 1999 but broke that hoodoo with German internationals Michael Ballack and Bastian Schweinsteiger on target. It was sweet revenge for Bayern who surrendered their German title to Bremen with a 3-1 loss at the Olympic Stadium last season. Bayern are starting to click into gear, building on their 4-0 Champions League demolition of Ajax in midweek, and leapfrogged Bremen into third with the three points. "We ardefeat thanks to a Victor Agali hat-trick with Marama Vahira clinching this most improbable of all wins.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Argentina was the whipping boy at weekend talks of global finance leaders, with a series of criticisms aired over the country's failure to come to terms with its bondholders and the International Monetary Fund. Officials of the IMF and World Bank, which held annual meetings in Washington concluding Sunday, echoed the scolding of the Group of Seven financial powers given to Argentina. Argentina's failure to strike a deal with bondholders left hanging after its spectacular 2001 default remains a key issue for the IMF and global financial community, as is the country's failure to meet IMF conditions for fresh assistance. "We urge the Argentine authorities to implement, as soon, as possible the prior actions required for the completion of the (IMF) Third Review while fulfilling its current obligations fully and timely," Friday's G7 statement said. "Argentina's key challenges remain structural reforms, building a sound fiscal framework, and achieving high creditor participation in a sustainable debt restructuring." Buenos Aires has proposed to pay off the debt at 25 percent of face value, a proposal that most creditors have rejected so far. IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato has taken a hard line with Argentine authorities, insisting on budget reforms to free up more money to pay bondholders. "It's very important for the future of the Argentinian economy that the structural issues that are pending and the medium term framework are completed, and that will fulfill the commitments the Argentinian goverment put in its letter of intent to the Fund last March," Rato said. He said the restructuring of some 100 billion dollars in debt from its bond default "will allow Argentina to regain a normal situation in the financial markets as a prerequisite for a sustainble growth." In comments that may have been directed at Argentina, Rato said there were times when the Fund must take a tougher approach to help countries in need, including saying no. "The IMF's loans to Mexico in 1995, to Korea in 1997, and the support in recent years to Brazil and Turkey, are some of the examples from the recent past where large-scale support was appropriate," he said. "That said, we also need a Fund that can say 'no.' The prospect of the fund declining to provide financial support would strengthen the incentives to implement sound policies, thus avoiding the need for fund support in the first place." The IMF recently gave Argentina a one-year extension on repaying 1.1 billion dollars in debt, but is pressing for more reforms and a better deal with bondholders before releasing new credits to the South American nation. Italian Finance Minister Domenico Siniscalco did not mince words over Argentina's actions, saying the country has not lived up to commitments made a year ago at the IMF's meeting in Dnos Aires said there would be no change to the offer to bondholders, which would require a 75 percent writedown of its debt.]]></c>

Montreal will move to Washington, D.C. next season after 36 years in Canada's Quebec province. They finished in last place with a 67-95 record and concluded with an all-time mark of 2,755-2,943. "The name 'Montreal Expos' will not be used again. It's a rude awakening," Montreal manager Frank Robinson said. "It's a sad situation because people in Montreal are losing a team. It's a shame it didn't work out." It ended where it began in New York's Shea Stadium. Montreal entered Major League Baseball with an 11-10 victory over the Mets at Shea Stadium on April 8, 1969. Montreal had far less offence in its final game as Tom Glavine (11-14) pitched six strong innings, allowing one run and three hits. Montreal infielder Brad Wilkerson said the news is not all bad. "It's both special and sad at the same time," said American Wilkinson. Dodgers pitcher Eric Gagne, who grew up in Montreal, said the Expos demise will be felt more than just on the field. Gagne is afraid the decision will also mean less young players will play baseball in Montreal. "It is sad," Gagne said. "I can't tell you how many Expos games I went to when I was a kid. "It is going to be hard for the economy and hard for the people in Montreal and everyone needs to realize that." The game also marked the last for Zeile, who is retiring after playing for 11 teams in 16 seasons. A former Expo, Zeile started at catcher and went out in style with his home run. "I was relaxed at the plate. If ever there was a time, this was it," said Zeile. "I would have liked to be playing some October baseball, but I couldn't have been happier from a personal standpoint."]]></c>

Funk, 48, captured the three million dollar Southern Fram Bureau Classic with a birdie on the par-five final hole. He picked up 540,000 dollars for the win. Funk had three birdies in the final four holes and a total of seven. He also had a bogey to finish at 22-under 266. Funk, who is 40th on the money list, became the second consecutive player over the age of 40 to win the event. In 2003, John Huston, 42, became the fifth 40-plus champion at the Annandale Golf Club. Funk had not won a tournament since winning here in 1998 when it was known as the Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic. He birdied Nos. 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 16 and 18, with the only stumble occurring at No. 8. Palmer, 28, fired an eight-under 64, birdying an incredible 10 holes. Four golfers finished two strokes back at 20-under -- Kevin Na, J.J. Henry, Loren Roberts and Glen Day.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Hezbollah criticises Annan over Lebanese remarks.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BEIRUT, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah on Sunday denounced last month's UN Security Council resolution calling for the respect of Lebanese sovereignty and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's comments that Lebanon and Syria have not met the resolution's demands. UN Resolution 1559 of September 2 is "biased", Hezbollah's number two, Sheikh Naim Qassem, complained on the Arabic al-Arabiya television channel. "It constitutes a sword of Damocles on Lebanon and Syria and is aimed at putting pressure on Syria," he said on the Dubai-based satellite news channel. The resolution calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces in Lebanon in a clear reference to Syria, which remains the main power broker in the country with more than 10,000 troops on the ground in its smaller neighbour. Syria has not complied with the UN Security Council demand to pull its troops out of Lebanon and said it cannot give a timetable for doing so, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan reported on Friday. "The government of Syria has informed me that it cannot provide me with numbers and timetables for any future withdrawal," Annan said in the report released to the press. "The requirements on the various parties set out in resolution 1559 have not been met," he added. The Hezbollah official said the UN resolution "place Lebanon under international guardianship" and denies the country the right to decide for itself. "Hezbollah protects lebanon. and the Lebanese people," he said. Without the "resistance", Israel could do what it liked to Lebanon, he added. The United States has frequently demanded that Syria halt its support for Hezbollah. Earlier Sunday Lebanese Foreign Minister Jean Obeid accused Annan of making a biased assessment of international respect for Beirut's sovereignty that highlighted Syrian breaches while ignoring Israel's. "Annan's report on Lebanon and Syria is extreme and exaggerated and lets Israel off too lightly by ignoring its violations," Obeid told reporters. "We would have hoped for a fairer, more accurate and comprehensive report."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Senior finance officials on Sunday hailed a robust global economic recovery, albeit one threatened by surging oil prices, but made little headway pushing China toward currency reform and took no firm steps to ease the debt of the world's poorest nations. Delegates from many of the 184 members of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank wrapped up three days of high-level financial talks that got underway Friday with a gathering of the Group of Seven. That session saw Chinese officials sitting down for the first time with central bankers and finance ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. World Bank President James Wolfensohn, in a notably blunt speech to the delegates Sunday, scolded world leaders, faulting them for failing to make good on commitments to the poor and of holding regular meetings that yield little more than praise and blame. "Without greater visible engagement by global leadership, we will not make the breakthroughs we need to ensure real security and peace," he said. "The way our system works today is that, at a sequence of global meetings, we agree on objectives," after which national governments then set out to meet the objectives, holding another meeting in five years. "Usually the meeting concludes that we have not achieved our objectives. New targets are set. Blame and praise is attributed and we set out on the next five years," Wolfensohn said. Speaker after speaker at IMF-World Bank plenary sessions Sunday and meetings of smaller policymaking bodies on Saturday said the world economy was humming along at its briskest pace in 30 years, with momentum expected to hit five percent this year. But the horizon is clouded by rising oil prices, prompting an appeal here to oil producers to ensure that supplies are sufficient to keep prices manageable, along with huge deficits in the United States and tepid growth in a eurozone resistant to reform. The G7 had been hoping that by inviting China for informal discussions Beijing might be induced to allow its currency, at present pegged to the dollar, to float freely. IMF and World Bank delegates likewise called for currency flexibility, seen as a needed measure in response to what is considered an artificially weak yuan that gives China an unfair export advantage. In the end China held its ground and gave no hint that it might speed up moves toward flexibility. "We have already said, time and again, that we are moving towards more market-based, supply-and-demand-based, exchange rates," said Li Ruogu, deputy head of the Chinese central bank. "How long it takes, I don't know. I have no timeframe." The ministers and central bank governors, who were in Washington in their capacity as governopoor countries could wait no longer and pledged to produce a progress report on the question by the end of the year. Despite the inaction here, African finance ministers voiced optimism about what they said was fresh momentum on the part of Western nations toward debt relief. Speaking of the debt owed by poor nations -- and those in Africa in particular -- to multilateral bodies such as the Bank and the Fund, Malawi Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe said "our understanding is that ideas are travelling forward on dealing with that." "They are being put forward by some very powerful people in the (IMF-World Bank) membership," he said, adding: "We are extremely expectant something will come out of it. We feel very confident that it (forgiveness of multilateral debt) will be accepted quickly as a matter of policy." The G7 also vowed to reduce Iraq's 120-billion-dollar debt by January but remained at odds over the scope of the cut, with France advocating a 50 percent reduction now against calls for a 95 percent reduction by the United States and Britain.]]></c>

Two rockets were fired at the men, Mohammad Al Simri and Hassan Al Jabari, near the former's home in the east of the city. A Palestinian woman was also said to have been injured in the attack. Al Simri, a leading figure in the group's armed branch, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, escaped a similar targetted killing attempt by the Israeli army earlier this year. The latest attack came as the Israeli military carries out a large-scale operation in the northern Gaza Strip in a bid to out an end to rocket fire on Israeli land.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Residents of the Iraqi city of Samarra collected the bodies of their relatives Sunday, two days after a massive US-Iraqi operation to root out rebels, as US warplanes pounded Fallujah for a third time in just over 24 hours killing at least two people. The stench of decomposing bodies filled the corridors of Samarra's hospital as staff wearing surgical masks lifted corpses out of the building one after the other, shouting out names as they reached the front doors, where families waited. At least 150 people died and scores were wounded in the two-day joint offensive against Samarra, a predominantly Sunni Muslim city north of Baghdad that had been in the grip of rebels since June. A US military commander said Sunday he estimated that 10 percent of the dead were civilians while local hospital officials said that percentage may be much higher. Ambulances guarded by US military vehicles were going around Samarra to collect the bodies of the dead, while Iraqi national guardsmen roamed the streets in pickup trucks or stood at intersections. Many buildings in the city's commercial district were either riddled with bullets or partially destroyed, the streets littered with burnt out vehicles. Despite the bloodshed and destruction, Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib said the mission was the most successful to date, and hinted at more action to regain control of no-go areas ahead of the January 2005 elections. But a leading Sunni Muslim religious group blasted the Samarra operation calling it a "massacre" and warned the interim government that its US-influenced strategy will plunge the country into more chaos. "Who is going to respect elections paved by the blood of Iraqis and built on their skulls." asked Sheikh Mohammed Bashar al-Faidi, spokesman for the respected Committee of Muslim Scholars, during a press conference at Baghdad's Umm al-Qura mosque. US national security advisor Condoleezza Rice praised the US-Iraqi cooperation in the operation. "The reporting from the ground is that things have gone well," the senior White House advisor told CNN television, although she cautioned that it was "premature" to say that the operation was "wrapped up" since "insurgencies have a tendency to wax and wane." "But clearly, the really good news out of this is that Iraqi forces have fought alongside American forces, and. they've done well," Rice said. Following the Samarra operation, many believe the insurgent bastion of Fallujah, which US marines tried to subdue in April, may be next on the list in light of the repeated campaign of US airstrikes. The outskirts of Fallujah were smouldering again overnight after US warplanes bombed a building where the military said between 10 and 15 insurgents suspected of links with Iraq's most wanted man Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi had been shifting weapons. "A lo kill him in 72 hours if his employer failed to halt its Iraq operations. The firm responded almost immediately by announcing it had ceased all its activities in the strife-torn country. The family of British engineer Kenneth Bigley, held hostage in Iraq for more than two weeks, has asked Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi to help secure his release, they said on Sunday. As families in Britain, France, Indonesia and elsewhere waited for news of their loved ones held hostage in Iraq, US Brigadier General Erv Lessel said the militants may regret their grisly actions. "The tactic of increasingly violent and shocking terrorist acts has the potential to backfire by increasingly turning Iraqi and world public opinion against the terrorists," Lessel, the chief spokesman for the US-led forces in Iraq, told AFP.]]></c>

With one race left in the IRL season, Kanaan, of Brazil, has a commanding 80-point lead over teammate Dan Wheldon, who finished third on Sunday. Mexico's Adrian Fernandez edged Kanaan to win the race but it wasn't enough to knock Kanaan off his perch. Sam Hornish, a two-time champion here, was fourth in a Dallara/Toyota, followed by Buddy Rice's G Force/Honda. Kanaan was leading Fernandez in a wheel-to-wheel battle with six laps left before Tomas Enge spun and was struck by Tomas Scheckter to bring out the caution flag at California Speedway. When the flag came out, Fernandez was just a shade ahead of Kanaan's Dallara/Honda and was placed as the leader. The two then went side-by-side for the final lap. The two Dallara/Honda drivers were able to race in formation until Fernandez nudged ahead at the checkered flag to win by 0.0155 seconds.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Blair's popularity mounts after heart operation: poll.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair's popularity has increased since he underwent an operation last week to correct an irregular heartbeat, according to an opinion poll published in The Times on Monday. Thirty-five percent of respondents to the Populus Institute poll said they would vote for Blair's ruling Labour party if a general election were held now. That figure is a three-percent increase over a similar poll held a month ago, while support for the opposition Conservatives was down two percent to 28 percent in the latest poll. The Liberal Democrats received 25 percent of the support of those polled, one point up on last month. Regarding personal popularity, Blair scored 5.31 out of ten in the opinion poll, against 4.98 for Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy and 4.15 for Conservative party boss Michael Howard. Blair's popularity is thus the highest it has been since the end of major military operations in Iraq in May 2003, The Times reported. However more than half of those questioned thought Blair should quit now or very soon (39 percent) or soon after the next elections, expected to be held in the spring (16 percent). Thirty-six percent expressed the wish that the Prime Minister will stay on until the end of a third term, as he intends to do if re-elected. Howard's popularity, according to the poll, is now at its lowest ebb since he took up the reins of the Conservative Party last autumn. The Conservatives' loss has boosted the fortunes of the small but growing United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) which advocates British withdrawal from the European Union. More than two-thirds of Conservative supporters hope Howard will adopt a more Eurosceptic stance, according to The Times. Blair, 51, spent the weekend at Chequers, the country retreat outside London used by British prime ministers, having pronounced himself in "excellent" health as he set off there on Saturday, accompanied by his wife Cherie. It was a welcome rest after a rough-and-tumble week in which Blair tried to heal divisions over Iraq at the Labour Party conference, then underwent a two-and-a-half hour operation Friday to correct a recurring irregular heartbeat. In announcing his heart operation late Thursday, Blair also surprised the political establishment by declaring that if Labour won the next general election he would serve a third complete term as prime minister but no more. No other British premier has ever made such an announcement. It has been seen by pundits as a shrewd attempt by Blair to head off challenges to his own leadership inside an increasingly restive Labour Party. The Populus Institute polled 1,004 adults between September 30 and October 2, therefore mainly after Blair's operation.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Disgraced Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan has been punished by being nationally humilliated, US national security couselor Condoleezza Rice said Sunday. Rice was asked on CNN to clarify President George W. Bush's statement during his debate late Thursday with Senator John Kerry that "the A.Q. Khan network has been brought to justice." Khan, the father of his country's nuclear bomb, publicly confessed in February to leaking nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea. But Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who insisted the proliferation was carried out by a handful of scientists without government involvement, has given Khan a conditional pardon. And Pakistan officials have refused agents with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's atomic watchdog agency, access to interview Khan to discuss the international black market he used to run. Khan is "a particular kind of figure in Pakistani lore, a national hero, and Musharraf has dealt with what is a very difficult situation" by "making certain that he's out of business," said Rice. Khan has lost privileges "to travel and the like," said Rice, and "a number of countries are pursuing prosecutions" of network members, she added, mentioning South Africa and at least one unnamed European country. "A.Q. Khan, in a sense, has been brought to justice because he is out of the business that he loved most," said Rice. "And if you don't think that his national humiliation is justice for what he did, I think it is. He's nationally humiliated.]]></c>

"Usually the meeting concludes that we have not achieved our objectives. New targets are set. Blame and praise is attributed and we set out on the next five years," Wolfensohn said. His counterpart at the IMF, managing director Rodrigo Rato, likewise had some sobering words for the session. The IMF, he asserted, has to learn to say "no" in some cases to crisis-stricken countries to force them toward better economic policies. "The IMF's loans to Mexico in 1995, to Korea in 1997, and the support in recent years to Brazil and Turkey, are some of the examples from the recent past where large-scale support was appropriate," he told the meeting. "That said, we also need a Fund that can say 'no.' The prospect of the Fund declining to provide financial support would strengthen the incentives to implement sound policies, thus avoiding the need for fund support in the first place." Speaker after speaker at plenary sessions of the two institutions on Sunday as well as at meetings of smaller policymaking bodies on Saturday said the world economy was humming along at its briskest pace in 30 years, with momentum expected to hit five percent this year.

		<t><![CDATA[Kerry blasts Bush on economy, Iraq.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CLEVELAND, Ohio, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democratic hopeful John Kerry fired a double attack at President George W. Bush Sunday, accusing of him of misleading Americans on Iraq and destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs. Kerry is trying to link what he sees as Bush's dogmatic refusal to change course as US deaths mount in Iraq, with his management of an economy Democrats say enriches the powerful at the expense of the middle classes. He flew into the clutch Midwestern state of Ohio, where polls show pocketbook issues concern voters as much as the foreign policy and national security which has dominated the campaign so far. Kerry seized on a New York Times report that the White House knew before invading Iraq that some of its intelligence on Saddam Hussein's alleged nuclear weapons program was questionable. "There are very serious questions about whether the administration was open and honest in making the case for war in Iraq," Kerry said at a meeting in Austintown, in the battleground state's deprived rustbelt. "These are questions that the president must face. These are questions that the president has to answer fully to the American people and the troops," he said. The veteran Massachusetts senator was chasing the shadow of President George W. Bush who visited Ohio on Saturday to denounce his rival's own economic plan, just 30 days before the November 2 election. "You better get elected, we can't take four more years of that whack job," yelled Richard Gonnella, a retired steelworker, as Kerry greeted workers picketing on a crisp fall morning at a titanium plant in Niles, Ohio. "It's up to you," Kerry replied, as state polls gave him the thinnest of leads over Bush, in an area hammered by job cuts and outsourcing of jobs overseas. No Republican candidate has ever lost Ohio and gone on to take the White House. As it battles to cling on to the state, the Bush campaign charges that Kerry's budget plans to fund healthcare and boost employment don't add up. But Kerry said : "there is nothing conservative about these people, they are radical, extreme, they have no regard for fiscal responsibility. "Stop and think about 270,000 lost jobs in Ohio. stop and think about schools that have after school programs are being cut so that the most powerful people have been taken care of," Kerry in Austintown, in the heart of the state's economically depressed rust belt. "We can balance our budget, we can create jobs, we can be fiscally responsible. "We know we can do it because from 1993 until the year 2000 we did exactly that," he said referring to what Democrats see as a golden economic age under former president Bill Clinton. Kerry later moved onto the city of Cleveland, which nestles on the shores of Lake Erie which separates Canada and the United States, to court African-American voteon in early September. Kerry visited the RMI Titanium plant in Niles, Ohio, where 361 workers have been locked out since October 2003, after rejected a contract which called for three million dollars in concessions.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Lula gains in Brazil local elections.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRASILIA, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Brazil's governing Workers Party made gains in local elections Sunday, leaving President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva well placed for a second- term run and worrying opposition parties. "We now have about 180 mayoralties in the country and that should rise to at least 500," Lula's communications minister, Luiz Dulci, told CBN radio, based on exit polls. The Workers Party (PT) claims it will control 500 of the 5,562 municipalities up for grabs. Brazil is Latin America's largest country, with a population of 170 million, and nearly one-half of South America's economy. Analysts will measure how much Lula's party benefited at the local level from his popularity and encouraging economic news, with an eye on his chances for re-election in 2006. Exit polls showed PT incumbent mayors of state capitals returned to city hall in Belo Horizonte and Recife, Brazil's third- and seventh-larges cities respectively, according to the Brazilian Institute for Public Opinion and Stadistics (Ibpoe). The prospect of a PT sweep worried former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who published an opinion column Sunday, which said the PT threatened to make Brazil a "one-party state, as much for the fragility of the other parties as for the organization and excessive appetite of the party that governs the country" with its "non-democratic use of democratic rules." Lula cast his ballot shortly after polls opened in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, where one of the most closely watched mayoral battles was being fought. Sao Paulo's PT mayor, Marta Suplicy, and challenger Jose Serra each won about 40 percent of the vote, according to Ibpoe. That means an October 31 run off election for Suplicy and Serra. An earlier poll put Serra comfortably ahead of Suplicy in a theoretical second-round vote. The election is a comeback effort for Serra, who lost the 2002 presidential race to Lula as candidate for the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PBDS), but who is tipped as a possible contender in the presidential race in 2006, when Lula may run for a second term. "A victory for Serra will demonstrate that the opposition is alive and well and the Workers' Party can't sell the idea of an automatic win for Lula," said political consultant Jose Luciano Dias. Partial official results for major cities and state capitals were expected around 9:00 pm (0001 GMT), while returns from 90 percent of the country were expected by 11:00 pm (0200 GMT), according to election officials. Brazil uses electronic voting machines. In Rio de Janeiro, the country's second-largest city, incumbent mayor Cesar Maia from the opposition Liberal Front Party seemed headed for re-election, according to exit polls. The PT candidate only pulled eight percent of votes, according to Ibpoe. Run-offs will be held the use of 406,000 electronic voting machines in 359,326 polling stations. Ibpoe said poll results have a margin of error of plus or minus 1.7 percentage points.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KILKENNY, Ireland, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[World number two Ernie Els and Denmark's Thomas Bjorn have finally rid themselves of the golfing demons that threatened to detrail their careers. Els did it by winning the seven-million-dollar WGC American Express Championship on Sunday. Bjorn did it by coming second - a finish he did not think possible three months ago when he quit in the middle of the opening round of the European Open at the K Club in Ireland, his game in tatters and his mind in turmoil. Two weeks ago Els' mind was also in turmoil. His golf game was great but he wasn't winning. The 34-year-old South African has become obsessed with winning Majors and this year he looked as if he might do the impossible and win all four. But Phil Mickelson delivered a killer blow at the Masters - depriving Els of his first Green jacket with a birdie on the 72nd green. At the US Open Els was poised to win on Sunday until he spectaculary collapsed in the final round. Unheralded Todd Hamilton beat him in a playoff at Troon in the Open. And Els again lost out at the PGA Championhsip. All the last gasp defeats had sent Els into depression - his self-confidence shattered. But a two-week break before arriving at Mount Juliet saw an upbeat Els, raring to go. He insisted he had put the disappointment and bitterness behind him. He was now looking forward and not back. But when he won the American Express Champion by a single shot from Bjorn after the two had been locked in a dramatic two-man shootout on the Sunday, Els admitted the win had been vital for him - and his confidence. "I think I had more pressure than anyone in the field. Everyone knows what I have been through this summer. I wanted to draw a line and make the switch. I needed to make the switch. I had to go do it myself and I did it," said a clearly relieved Els. "I've got to take a huge positive from here. All in all, very rewarding," he added. For Bjorn, a close friend and next-door neighbour to Els in London, suddenly his golf life was back on track after the despair of July, when he quit the game for five weeks to see what he could to salvage his career. His near-flawless performance has restored his self-confidence and has him ready to take on anybody. "I had those five wseeks and I spent a long time thinking about what I wanted to do with my golf and this is a massive step in the right direction," said Bjorn on his performace all week in Ireland. "I'm not looking to the past because this is a sign for me that, yeah, I can play with the big boys again. "I came up one shot short of Ernie but I came up a long way ahead of everybody else. That was a big leaderboard. I'm proud of what I did this week. I've come a long way," said the Dane.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GLASGOW, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rangers manager Alex McLeish has denied reports suggesting he is about to get his hands on a massive transfer budget to strengthen his squad in January. David Murray has announced measures to wipe out Rangers' debt, thought to be around 72 million pounds (130 million dollars), through a new share issue and investment from wealthy supporters of the club. Some reports suggested that up to 10 million pounds was also to be made available to McLeish for bringing in players to improve his side's chances in the Scottish Premier League and in the UEFA Cup. Speaking after his side's 2-0 win at home to Kilmarnock on Sunday, however, the Rangers' boss told reporters that he knew nothing about this money and would not be holding his breath before getting his hands on any of it. He said: "I just have to take everything with a pinch of salt and I'll believe it when I see it. There have been whispers but until I hear anything else then I won't get too carried away with it. "This job will never be easy no matter how much money is available. There have been targets set in recent years that we haven't been able to bring to the club but I don't think it is right to speculate on funding that might not be available." Rangers' win against Kilmarnock ensured Celtic did not increase their five-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premier League. A first half goal for Marvin Andrews and a Nacho Novo strike with nine minutes to go were enough to give McLeish's side all three points in a scrappy encounter at Ibrox. Celtic had earlier secured a comfortable 3-0 win away to Dundee United to go eight points clear putting the pressure on their Glasgow rivals to win their match. Rangers had opened the scoring through the unlikely source of defender Andrews after only 10 minutes. Fernando Rickson's corner fell to Stephen Hughes on the edge of the box and when he drove a shot across goal, the big Trinidad and Tobago international slid in to poke the ball past Alan Combe in the Kilmarnock goal. Despite the early goal, the Ibrox side were struggling to find their rhythm or create many clear-cut chances, and with Kilmarnock rarely threatening the Rangers rearguard the game was proving to be a scrappy affair. Klos was a virtual spectator with Rangers in complete command of the game but on 69 minutes he was finally called into action. Australian Danny Invincible drove forward and struck a powerful shot from 20-yards but the Rangers captain got his body behind the ball and saved easily. Kilmarnock then almost shocked the Ibrox crowd of 46,278 after 76 minutes when Boyd's shot from outside the box beat Klos only to rebound back off the left-hand post. McLeish decided to change things round on 79 minutes bringing on Dad Prso for Thompson and within two minutes the change was rewarded. Vignal's free-kick from deep inside the Rangers half was headed on by the Croatian striker straight into the path of Novo who blasted a right-foot shot past Combe to tie up the points. Celtic took all three points in a comfortable 3-0 win away to Dundee United. A Chris Sutton double, the second from the penalty spot, either side of a Stilian Petrov strike tied up the points for the Parkhead side before the break.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Jose Mourinho has blasted accusations that his Chelsea side are playing negative football and is adamant they are an attractive team to watch. Chelsea have scored eight goals in eight English Premiership matches, just two more than bottom-of-the-table Crystal Palace. With a miserly one league goal conceded, the Blues are unbeaten this season and two points behind Arsenal at the top of the Premiership. But Chelsea boss Mourinho hit out at critics wondering whether his team are being too defensive after they beat Liverpool at Stamford Bridge with another 1-0 victory. "I think one day when we are top of the league, people will stop asking these type of questions," the Portuguese said. "We have played ten matches and nobody could beat us. When somebody says that we don't score many goals, well of course it's true. "But it's untrue when somebody says we don't want to play attacking football, we don't want to win, we don't want to dominate our opponent because we do it all the time. "The teams playing against us should receive more criticism than us because they play defensive football against us," he continued. "The only criticism I accept is when people say we don't score many goals." One of Mourinho's first acts on taking over Chelsea in the pre-season was to trim the bloated squad he inherited from his predecessor Claudio Ranieri. But injuries to forwards Mateja Kezman and Adrian Mutu left him without striker to bring on against Liverpool when Didier Drogba limped off with a groin injury that will rule him out of action for at least two weeks. Midfielder Joe Cole came on in attack to fill in next to Eidur Gudjohnsen and struck the winner from a Frank Lampard free kick, but the situation raised fears over Chelsea's lack of prolific strikers this season compared to their rivals. Champions Arsenal have fired in 26 goals and conceded seven in the Premiership so far with Thierry Henry, Jose Antonio Reyes, Robert Pires and Fredrik Ljungberg racking up the strikes. Mourinho appreciates the Gunners' effectiveness going forward, but he is not dazzled by their goalscoring feats. "We are the second best team in the Premiership and we are the best English team in the Champions League. We are unbeaten," he said. "It's nice to score goals, it's nice to play well, and it's fantastic when you can score almost every goal in every attacking situation you get. "The distance between them and us is two points. It's about 20 goals, but you go to the points and it's just two. "We produce some fantastic attacking pieces of football; we are scoring enough goals to win."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Travelling blues trouble Reds' Benitez by Robin Millard.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rafael Benitez insists his Liverpool team are heading in the right direction, despite losing their way at Chelsea for a fourth successive defeat on the road. The Reds' 1-0 reverse at Stamford Bridge leaves them languishing 11th in the English Premiership after taking just one point from a possible 12 on their travels. Coming straight after their defeat to Olympiakos in the Champions League, the Reds' ability to challenge for top honours is in question. Liverpool boss Benitez made five changes from the team that slumped in Greece but although the new-look side still could not produce a win, the Spaniard insisted Liverpool are on the right track. "We played better than the last two games away. We have been stronger and we controlled better than in our other games," Benitez said after the Chelsea match. "We played a good game against a very good team. The only thing is when you keep the ball and you are counter-attacking, you need to score. "If you think about the last three games we played away from home, we played Manchester United, Olympiakos and Chelsea. "If you lose 2-1 or 1-0 you are in the right way but you need to do something more. "I changed many things," he said on dropping Steve Finnan, Dietmar Hamann, Stephen Warnock and Milan Baros in favour of Djimi Traore, Salif Diao, Harry Kewell and Djibril Cisse in the outfield. "We were losing away, we needed to change something if things are wrong. I decided to change four or five players and I am happy with them, all the players tried to fight, to run, and to do all the things we were talking about." Benitez has two excellent goalkeepers at his disposal in Poland's Jerzy Dudek and the promising Chris Kirkland, who would surely have won England recognition were it not for his dismal injury record. The Spaniard named Dudek his first choice, but after the string of setbacks, Benitez dropped the Pole in an attempt to change their luck. Kirkland performed well at Chelsea, but his return came too late to force his way back into the England squad, with Paul Robinson, David James and Robert Green named for the World Cup qualifiers against Wales and Azerbaijan. Kirkland, if he stays injury-free, could now find himself with a sustained run the the Liverpool side. "In my mind always with the goalkeepers, it's different," Benitez said. "If you change, you you need to give confidence to the new goalkeeper. I cannot say for the next game, but normally when you have problems, I would like the goalkeeper play four or five games at least." Previous manager Gerard Houllier was sacked after Liverpool finished a distant fourth behind Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United last season. Benitez feels it is too soon into his tenure to judge whether his Reds can threaten to break into the top bracket. "Now is too early. We need to see the team perhaps in one or two months, after that we can say. Now with the national games you lose a lot of players. I hope that in the next month we can see if we can challenge the top three." Benitez may feel his team are only one or two goals away from a change of luck, but he needs to cure the travel sickness before Liverpool can really threaten the likes of Chelsea.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ROME, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[New Roma coach Luigi Del Neri has defended temperamental striker Antonio Cassano for reacting badly to his second-half substitution in Sunday's dramatic 3-3 draw here with Inter Milan. Cassano, who had a number of spats with former Roma coaches Fabio Capello and Rudi Voller, was so unhappy with his withdrawal that rather than join the rest of the squad on the bench he went straight to the dressing room. His snub was met with cries of derision from angry Roma fans, who jeered and whistled him and sang 'Go to work' to the enigmatic, but hugely talented forward. However, Del Neri, who decided to take Cassano off when his side were trailing 3-2, insisted his abrasive forward deserved better as he was suffering from flu. "I was upset with the whistles for Cassano, it wasn't a very nice reaction," said Del Neri, who was appointed as successor to Voller on Wednesday. "Antonio is a particular type of footballer and he always wants to play. But tonight, he gave his contribution. "He wasn't feeling 100 per cent as he had a fever a few days ago and it probably wouldn't have happened had he been in good shape." Inter coach Roberto Mancini was angry with the way his team imploded after rallying from a goal down to take a commanding lead. "We threw the game away. We were 3-1 after an hour and then we draw," he said. "We were in difficulty at the start, but only for the first 10 minutes. "After that we started to control the play. We played well, but we wasted too many chances." Known for his attacking philosophy, Del Neri opted for a three-man forward line with Vincenzo Montella partnering Francesco Totti and Cassano up front. Roma began brightly and they took the lead in the ninth minute with a move that ripped Inter's often fragile defence apart. Totti fed the overlapping Amantino Mancini and the livewire Braer Mido.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Seattle Mariners gold glove outfielder Ichiro Suzuki singled in the eighth inning on Sunday against the Texas Rangers to finish the season with a major league record 262 hits. The 30-year-old from Japan smashed the 84-year-old record for hits in a season on Friday, passing George Sisler's 1920 mark of 257. Suzuki's historic hit on Sunday wasn't enough to spark Seattle as South Korea's Park Chan-Ho pitched seven strong innings to lead Texas to a 3-0 win. Brian Shouse relieved Park in the eighth and surrendered a leadoff single to Suzuki, who finished with 80 multi-hit efforts -- the most since division play began in 1969. Suzuki's amazing streak has not generated the same attention as other streak chasers in North American. But the same cannot be said in his native Japan where Ichiro fever has consumed baseball fans. Suzuki is the first player in North America to have 200 or more hits in his first four seasons. He also set marks for singles in a season, finishing with 225. He blasted just eight homers but had 24 doubles. In the first half of the season Suzuki registered 119 hits before exploding for 143 since the all-star break. He batted an amazing.463 in August and.432 in July for the Mariners which finished last place in the American League West Division with a dismal 63-99 record.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Short-term capital flows into the Philippines rose 4.0 percent from a year earlier to 421.1 million dollars in the nine months to September as the government took steps to address its ballooning debt, the central bank said Monday. The figure for net portfolio inflows included 78.3 million dollars in September, the highest for the year. "This may be attributed to the positive investor reaction to the government's efforts to address the fiscal problem, the upgrading of the economic growth forecast, and the retention of the central bank's policy rates," central bank officer-in-charge Armando Suratos said in a statement. President Gloria Arroyo has acknowledged that government reliance on debt to plug chronic budget deficits was unsustainable and could lead to what she described as "painful economic death." She has asked Congress to pass a set of laws designed to raise at least 80 billion pesos (1.42 billion dollars) more every year. The central bank last month decided against tightening monetary policy despite the build-up of inflationary pressures brought about by rising oil prices.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Some two-thirds of Russia's jail inmates suffer from mental illnesses, serious diseases from AIDS to tuberculosis and syphilis, or alcohol and drug addictions, a top justice ministry official said. "Over 120,000 prisoners suffer from mental conditions, 35,000 are HIV positive, over 58,000 have tuberculosis, 55,000 are alcoholics and 86,000 are drug addicts," Vladimir Yalunin, chief of the ministry's penal department, was quoted as saying by Interfax. "Prisons admit some 30,000 tuberculosis sufferers a year," Yalunin said, assuring however that improved medical care -- sponsored in part by 38-million-dollars from the World Bank -- slashed the number of incarcerated active sufferers from 100,000 to 58,700. According to Yalunin, Russia's prison population stands at 777,000. It was estimated at 820,000 as of October last year. Russia has taken stuttering steps towards revamping its criminal code, introducing alternative sentencing for crimes in a bid to cut down on the overcrowding which plagues one of the largest penitentiary systems in the world. With 628 prisoners for every 100,000 inhabitants, Russia has the world's third highest incarceration rate in the world -- behind the Cayman Islands and the United States, which has the highest rate of 686, according to a January 2003 study published by the International Center for Prison Studies.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The 2004 Nobel Prize season opens on Monday with the announcement of the prize for Medicine, kicking off the annual series of coveted awards culminating in the prestigious honours for Literature and for Peace. Scandinavian capitals Stockholm and Oslo are abuzz with speculation, and a feeling emerged that the Literature prize could go to a woman this year, while efforts to limit nuclear build-up and proliferation may be rewarded by the Peace award. Last year the Peace prize, the only honour to be bestowed in Oslo and not in Stockholm, went to Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi. There is no clear favourite ahead of this year's Peace announcement, scheduled for Friday, but if those tipping the nuclear sector are correct, then it may be the turn of the International Atomic Energy Commission and its chief, Mohamed ElBaradei. After playing a vital role in the inspections of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's weapons arsenal and the search for his suspected nuclear program, the IAEA is currently struggling to get Iran to halt controversial uranium enrichment-related activities and to get to the bottom of North Korea's secretive nuclear program. Women writers, long overlooked by the Swedish Academy, could be well-placed to take home the Literature honours this year, observers said, citing Algeria's Assia Djebar, Joyce Carol Oates of the United States and Dane Inger Christensen as potential winners. The Academy has honoured only nine women since the prize was first handed out more than a century ago. Most recently, it went to Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska in 1996. The prize will be awarded either this Thursday or the next. Last year, the honours went to J.M. Coetzee of South Africa. After Medicine on Monday, the Physics prize will be announced on Tuesday and Chemistry on Wednesday. The Economics prize, awarded by Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, is scheduled for October 11. Nobel prizes, founded by Sweden's Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, were first awarded in 1901. Laureates receive a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (1.1 million euros, 1.3 million dollars), which can be split between up to three winners.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Five days from Australia's elections, Prime Minister John Howard's government has a four-point lead over its Labor rivals, according to a new poll Monday just a week after another poll showing the exact reverse. The latest survey was conducted at the weekend for the Sydney Morning Herald by leading market researcher ACNielsen, which has shown a consistent trend towards Howard's conservative Liberal-National coalition since the campaign was announced five weeks ago. The Australian newspaper's equally respected Newspoll last week gave the opposition a four-point lead, enough to send Howard into retirement and Labor into government with a comfortable majority if repeated at the October 9 poll. However, a Newspoll published on Sunday of a dozen of the most marginal seats which will decide the election outcome showed the coalition holding on narrowly but uniformly to all of its most contested ground. Further complicating the equation, a Morgan Poll, also published Monday, told a different story which suggested Labor would win if current trends continue. It found support for Labor was 51.5 percent, up 1.5 percent in a week in a two-way split, while coalition support had dropped to 48.5 percent. Politicians on both sides say the only conclusion that can be drawn from such conflicting polls is that the outcome is still too close to call. Howard, also said to be buoyed by private polling, displayed more optimism at the weekend than he had previously, saying: "I think we'll make it, but it will be close." Labor leader Mark Latham meantime reverted to assuming underdog status. The ACNielsen poll, of 1,400 voters, depicted a polarised electorate supporting the coalition, but showing also that the minor left-leaning Greens Party was emerging suddenly as a third force in Australia's political arena. The poll found the coalition led Labor by 52-48 percent in a two-way contest, while the Greens had emerged as a third force in Australian politics, more than doubling the 4.9 percent it won at the November, 2001 election. Support for the Greens had surged to a new all-time high of 12 percent in its bid for seats in the Senate, which meant it was likely to hold the balance of power in its own right in the upper house, instead of sharing it with the other minor parties as it did in the last parliament. Pollster John Stirton said that if the coalition's margin was repeated on Saturday the government would win with its majority of eight seats roughly intact. The poll also showed Howard continued to lead Latham as preferred prime minister by 52 percent to 40 percent.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SUKHUMI, Georgia, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A hard-nosed nationalist is expected to emerge as leader of the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia following an election held amid simmering tension between the separatist regime here and Georgia's rulers. With polling stations closed following Sunday's vote and the count underway, local observers said Raul Khajimba -- the current leader's anointed successor and the candidate endorsed by neighbouring Russia -- was favourite to be declared the winner. The identity of Abkhazia's next chief matters because the picturesque enclave on the Black Sea coast is seen as a potential flashpoint between Georgia's pro-Western leaders and Moscow, which has given its tacit support to the Abkhaz separatists. Front-runner Khajimba on Sunday signalled the kind of policy he would pursue if, as anticipated, he is elected as Abkhazia's leader. "We were in Georgia once and we do not want to go back to that," Khajimba said as he cast his ballot at school No.4 in the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi. "Whoever wins the election, Abkhazia's path will be that of an independent state. Our policy of moving closer to Russia will (also) stay the same." In the Georgian capital Tbilisi there was condemnation of an election in which ballot papers were printed in Russian and Abkhaz, but not Georgian, even though the region is still internationally recognized as part of the former Soviet republic. "Of course we, along with the whole of the international community, do not recognise the legitimacy of these elections," Georgia's Security Minister Vano Merabishvili said late Saturday. Opposition supporters claimed there had been polling irregularities favouring Khajimba. But Sergei Smyr, head of the central election commission, told reporters that he had not yet received notification of any violations. "Everything has been going calmly and the voters are being very active," he said. According to Smyr, some 62 percent of Abkhazia's 120,000 registered voters cast their ballots. First results were expected later Monday morning. Sunday's poll was the first properly contested leadership election held in Abkhazia since it shook off Tbilisi's rule in in the early 1990s. It was called to choose a replacement for Vladislav Ardzinba, the serving president of the separatist regime who for the last several years has been incapacitated by serious illness. Khajimba, 46, is currently Abkhazia's prime minister. He has been seen as the favourite ever since Russia's President Vladimir Putin gave him a televised audience -- a crucial endorsement in a region that is effectively a Russian protectorate. His closest challenger in the five-strong field has been Sergei Bagapsh, a 55-year-old businessman. Bagapsh has a Georgian wife, which has led some observers to say he might be more ready to compromise with Tbilisi than his rival. teway for oil exports from the Caspian Sea to Western markets.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Singapore's recently installed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong left for Brunei and Malaysia on Monday for the start of a series of official introductory visits to Southeast Asian countries, the government said. Lee will have lunch with Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah during his day-long trip to Bandar Seri Begawan, before travelling to Kuala Lumpur in the evening ahead of a Tuesday meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean and Education Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam will accompany Lee on the trip, the government said in a statement. In Malaysia, Lee and Abdullah are expected to sign a revised double taxation agreement that is aimed at improving economic and investment opportunities between their two countries. Singapore and Malaysia have a long history of prickly relations dating back to their separation over racial tensions in 1965, and issues such as a territorial dispute over a rocky islet continue to cause problems. But relations have improved rapidly since Abdullah replaced Mahathir Mohamad as Malaysian leader in October last year. With high-level government contacts between the neighbours accelerating and cross-border investments expanding, hopes are high that Abdullah and Lee will oversee a solid and long-lasting improvement in bilateral relations. The Singapore government did not say when Lee would travel to the seven other Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries to complete the customary round of official introductory visits. Lee was installed as Singapore's prime minister on August 12, taking over from Goh Chok Tong, who was in power for 14 years. Lee is the son of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who remains an influential figure in government with the official title of Mentor Minister.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japan will ask the United States to move some of its marines based on Okinawa island abroad because of strong opposition from Japanese mainland cities to hosting US military bases, a report said Monday. In return for relocating troops outside of Japan, Tokyo would provide pre-positioning facilities for weapons, fuel and other equipment for the US military, Japan's top-selling daily Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting Japanese government sources. A senior Japanese foreign ministry official declined to confirm the report, but said Tokyo and Washington were discussing "various options" to downscale the US military presence on Okinawa. A US military spokeswoman declined to comment on the report. Strategically located Okinawa, captured by US forces in 1945 and returned to Japan in 1972, accounts for less than one percent of Japan's land mass but hosts about 65 percent of the 40,500 US forces in the country. Tokyo and Washington have agreed to reduce the US military bases there but no concrete plans have been worked out, partly due to the reluctance of other regions of Japan to host troops. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said Friday Tokyo had made little progress in reducing Okinawa's burden due to opposition from local authorities. The United States wants to relocate some of the Okinawa bases within Japan. During bilateral talks in July, the United States asked Japan to agree to the relocation of some 2,600 US marines to Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost mainland, and Camp Zama in Kanagawa, west of Tokyo, which is the headquarters for the US army in Japan, the Yomiuri Shimbun said. A series of crimes committed by US soldiers, as well as disputes over the ownership and use of the land on which US military facilities sit, have made Okinawa residents reluctant hosts. Most recently, the crash of a US military helicopter on an Okinawan university campus in August revived anti-American sentiment on the Japanese island, drawing 30,000 protesters in Japan's largest anti-US military rally in nearly a decade.]]></c>

Foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan pointed to the high number of civilian casualties among the 69 dead and called for a halt to the operation to stem rising tensions. "We express our serious concern about the latest bloody clashes between Israelis and Palestinians, which have caused many civilian casualties among the Palestinians," Kong said in a statement posted on the ministry's website. "We strongly urge Israel to stop its military operations in order to avoid further escalation in the tense situation in the region." The Israeli army launched the operation in northern Gaza late Tuesday which escalated a day later after a Palestinian rocket attack killed two children in the southern Israeli town of Sderot. All but three of the dead are Palestinians. The violence has been widely condemned and even Israeli ally the United States has expressed regret over the civilian casualties, calling for Israel to use only "proportional force."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Election spotlight falls on Cheney and Edwards by Jerome Rivet.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Vice President Dick Cheney and his Democratic counterpart John Edwards will step to the fore in the US election campaign on Tuesday for their own debate on the future of the United States. The debate at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland on Tuesday will reveal two vastly different characters in the running mates of Republican President George W. Bush and his Democratic rival for the White House, John Kerry. Cheney, one of the hawks of the US administration, has often been accused of operating in the dark shadows of American politics. Experts say he is one of the most influential vice presidents of all time. And he has taken on the role of attack dog in the Republican campaign for the November 2 election. The youthful Edwards has taken a secondary role in the battle for the White House. The 63-year-old vice president has proved a past-master of the negative attack while Edwards, 51, is a successful trial lawyer who made a point of avoiding negative attacks during the campaign for the Democratic nomination. Cheney uses dry humour a lot to make political points in his speeches. At most election rallies he compares himself to the North Carolina senator who wants the vice president's position. "Senator Edwards, of course, it is alleged, got his job because he's charming, sexy, good looking and has great hair. I said, how do you think I got the job. Why do they laugh." Edwards is in turn an expert public speaker -- bolstered by his time as a personal-injury lawyer -- with great charm and a natural optimism. As with the Kerry-Bush debate on Thursday, Iraq is expected to be the main topic of the vice presidential debate. Cheney has shown no regrets about the invasion of Iraq and links it even more than the president to the global war on terror. He says that those who oppose the Iraq war, like Kerry, are unworthy to act as American leaders. "The idea that somehow we could pull back and simply sit behind our oceans and not aggressively be going after the terrorists and those who sponsor terrorists, I think misreads the situation completely," he says at rallies. In one controversial speech, he said that if US voters make the "wrong choice" on November 2 "then the danger is that we'll get hit again," implying that Kerry was less determined than Bush in fighting extremists. The Democratic camp was outraged. Edwards called the attack "un-American", adding: "Dick Cheney's scare tactics crossed the line today, showing once again that he and George Bush will do anything and say anything to save their jobs." Democrats have made plenty of attacks on Cheney for his past links to Halliburton, the oil services giant with huge contracts in Iraq. And in a moment of frustration, the vice president used the "F-word" to one Democratic senator in the Senate chamber. Cheney has a history of heart disease, which he also jokes about sometimes, but visits two or three towns a day rousing the Republican faithful. Contrary to Cheney, who is a former defence secretary and has decades of experience in Washington, Edwards is a first-term senator building experience of national politics and with virtually none in foreign policy. But his speeches are widely hailed. Edwards plays on his own modest background as the son of a South Carolina mill worker to highlight the Democratic view of a two-speed America with the rich getting richer under the Republicans. Edwards entered politics following a family tragedy when his 16-year-old son was killed in a car accident. His wife Elizabeth is an energetic campaigner.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[An eight-year-old girl has died of bird flu in northern Thailand, becoming the country's 11th confirmed victim of the lethal virus this year, a health ministry official said Monday. "She died around 9:00 pm (Sunday) night (1400 GMT)," ministry spokeswoman Nitaya Chanruang Mahabhol told AFP. The girl, from Phetchabun province, was the third Thai to die during a new wave of outbreaks that started in July. At least 19 people have also died of bird flu in Vietnam since December last year and millions of birds have died or been culled across Asia. The girl, who was not named by officials, was taken to hospital with a fever last week after eight of the family's chickens died and was confirmed Sunday as having the lethal H5N1 form of the virus. The girl lived in a poorly ventilated one-storey house and helped pluck chickens after her grandmother culled them, according to a health ministry statement Sunday night. "Friends discouraged her without any success," it said. One thousand chickens in the village were due to be culled late Sunday. Thailand on Friday launched a "war on bird flu" with more than 900,000 volunteers carrying out house-to-house checks for signs of the disease. Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has announced a goal of eradicating the disease from Thailand by October 31 and thousands scoured outlying villages and poor areas of Bangkok for sick birds and humans. Bird flu outbreaks have affected 35 of Thailand's 76 provinces since the start of July to October 1, according to government figures. Both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Thai agriculture minister said the deadline would probably not be met but said the effort signalled Thailand's intention to address the issue vigorously. The health ministry has sent bird flu testing kits and anti-virus drugs to 700 hospitals across the country to cope with a potential outbreak among humans. Thailand, one of the world's largest poultry exporters before the bird flu crisis hit, also said it would overhaul its system of farming to try to prevent future crises. Officials last week confirmed its first probable case of human-to-human infection of bird flu following the deaths of a mother and daughter. Tests are still continuing to try to confirm that the girl had flu -- she was cremated before full tests could be carried out -- and to discover if the disease had mutated into a more contagious and lethal form that could trigger a wider health crisis. A mutated bird flu outbreak was blamed for the deaths of as many as 40 million people worldwide in 1918. Thai health officials said early indications were that the strain had not changed much.]]></c>

The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index gained 211.23 points to 11,196.40. The broader TOPIX index of all First Section shares rose 16.22 points or 1.45 percent to 1,133.51. "Partly helped by a brisk figure for the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey last Friday, and partly by Wall Street's gains, the market sentiment is improving," said Akihiro Shiroeda, analyst at Nozomi Securities. The closely watched Tankan poll showed continue improvement in business confidence in the three months to September while August industrial output rebounded. Among shares which enjoyed sharpest gains were high-techs. Tokyo Electron, the second-largest manufacturer of semiconductor and LCD making equipment, was up 170 yen or 3.1 percent at 5,630 yen, while Advantest, Japan's largest chip-testing equipment manufacturer rose 310 or 4.7 percent to 6,940. Precision equipment makers were also higher, with Canon up 150 or 2.9 percent at 5,360. Electronics makers rose, with Toshiba up 17 or 4.2 percent at 420, Sony ahead 70 or 1.9 percent at 3,850 and Matsushita Electric Industrial up 27 or 1.8 percent at 1,514.

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[North Korea has trained more than 500 computer hackers capable of launching cyber warfare against the United States, South Korea's defense ministry said Monday. In a report to the National Assembly's National Defense Committee, the ministry said that hackers from the impoverished Stalinist state were among the best in the world. "North Korea's intelligence warfare capability is estimated to have reached the level of advanced countries," the report said, according to Yonhap news agency. The military hackers had been put through a five-year university course training them to penetrate the computer systems of South Korea, the United States and Japan, the report added. Their goal, it said, was to gather intelligence or to launch a cyber attack. Ealier this year sensitive South Korea computer systems came under attack from abroad, according to intelligence reports. The attacks were considered a serious threat to national security, South Korea's National Intelligence Service said in July. The spy agency said the spate of cyber-attacks in June and July were launched from China but it was unable to say whether they were launched by Chinese nationals or nationals from a third country using China-based computers. The hackers broke into 211 computers at 10 government agencies in South Korea including defense and security-related agencies. National Assembly computers were also targetted as were computers at private companies, universities and media firms. "We believe the hackers are either Chinese or used China as a base for their attacks," an official at the National Cyber Security Center, attached to the national spy agency, said in July.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Labour shortage deals new Macau casino a poor hand.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[HONG KONG, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The operators of the newest casino in China's gambling boomtown Macau said Monday they were forced to open without their full complement of croupiers because of a shortage of skilled staff. The runaway success of the tiny former Portuguese enclave's gaming industry has meant there are not enough workers for new gaming facilities like the Casa Real Casino, which opened Saturday. "Macau's growth is so fast that we can't get the staff," Casa Real spokesman Felix Wee told AFP. "There is a terrible shortage of local, skilled, workers." Wee wouldn't be drawn on reports that some of the three-storey casino's 73 tables and 176 slot machines had to be closed because of the shortage. "Some of them are not ready to be opened yet," Wee said. Since rules were relaxed to allow foreign firms into the semi-autonomous Chinese city's lucrative casino business, the industry has ballooned to one pulling in more than four billion patacas (512 million US dollars) a month. Growth has been fuelled by a huge increase in mainland Chinese tourists and is expected to eclipse Las Vegas's five billion US dollar annual turnover by the end of next year, according to government estimates. US company Sands, which operates Vegas's plush Venetian resort, is leading the charge in new developments, spearheading the construction of a district that by 2009 will see some 25 new casinos and hotels employing up to 150,000 people. With a working population of just 250,000, economists have long been predicting a labour crunch that could cripple the industry. Gambling tycoon Stanley Ho, who until this year held a 40-year monopoly on gambling in the enclave and holds the licence to the new Casa Real, said the situation was critical. "Our hotels and casinos are all short of staff," Ho, who controls 13 casinos, told the South China Morning Post newspaper. "Macau is developing so fast that supporting elements, especially labour, are lagging behind." Analysts believe the Beijing-backed Macau government is vacillating on the labour issue, reluctant to heed industry calls for more foreign workers fearing it may cause unrest among the local Chinese population.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Brandon Backe allowed two runs in five-plus innings Sunday as Houston seized Major League Baseball's final playoff spot with a 5-3 triumph over the Colorado Rockies. Backe pitched after six-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens was scratched due to a virus. Clemens can pitch game one of the Astros National League Division Series. With its 18th consecutive home win and 36th in 46 games overall, Houston completed a superb final two months and secured a berth against the Atlanta in the National League Division Series. The series will begin Wednesday. Backe kept Colorado off the scoreboard through five innings. Houston pieced together a bullpen effort until their closer Brad Lidge came on to get the final four outs - all via strikeout. "(Roger) gave me some good advice and I was ready to go," Backe said. "I didn't get caught up in the moment. Who knows if I'd found out the night before that I was gonna start. "This is an unbelievable feeling. This is a dream I've been wanting to have all my life. Just to be part of this team is unbelievable." With the win, the Astros (92-70) did not need to worry about the result of the San Francisco and Los Angeles game. Had Houston lost, the Giants (91-71) could have forced a one-game playoff for the NL wild card with a win. The Giants were stung by a devastating 7-3 loss to the Dodgers on Saturday. Steve Finley's grand slam capped a thrilling seven-run ninth inning rally as the Dodgers captured their first division title since 1995. The Dodgers (93-69) are the third seed in the NL and will face the St. Louis Cardinals (105-57) in the opening round. "They're a solid team," Dodgers Shawn Green said of St. Louis. "They're similar to us, but we're a little thinner in the lineup. We are two teams that cover all aspects of the game." Anaheim (92-70) clinched the American League West Division with their second straight victory over the Oakland on Saturday. Anaheim will meet the Boston Red Sox (98-64), the AL wild card winner, in the first round. The New York Yankees (101-61) clinched their seventh straight AL East title Thursday with a 6-4 win over the AL Central champion Twins (92-70), their first-round opponent. The playoffs begin Tuesday with two best-of-five series in each league. As a result of the AL's victory in the all-star game, it will have home-field advantage in the World Series for the third consecutive year.]]></c>

At 11:40 am (0340 GMT), New York's reference contract, light sweet crude for November delivery was at 49.75 dollars a barrel, down from the record close in New York of 50.12 on Friday. Unrest in Nigeria had raised concerns about supply from the country, which ships some 2.5 million barrels per day, forcing prices higher. However, the two rebel groups fighting for control of oil resources in the Niger Delta region signed a government-brokered ceasefire and disarmament agreement on Friday after months of violence. The leader of the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force, Mujahid Dokubo Asari, then assured his arch rival, Niger Delta Vigilantes chief Akete Tom, on Sunday that he was ready to maintain the peace. The rebels had threatened to go to war if their demands for a bigger slice of Nigeria's oil wealth, greater autonomy for their Ijaw people and a national debate on Nigeria's problems were not met. Most of the 2.5 million bpd produced by Nigeria, which is the fifth largest oil supplier to the United States, comes from the Niger Delta.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Philippines general was suspended for alleged graft on Monday in the first such case involving a high-ranking army official in recent years. Major General Carlos Garcia, chief of the armed forces' plans and programs division, had allegedly misdeclared his statements of assets and liabilities and "his increase in net worth is disproportionate to his legitimate income," the military said in a statement. His suspension for six months without pay was recommended by the government ombudsman which said that Garcia committed "dishonesty, gross misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service," a military statement said. It added that armed forces chief General Narciso Abaya had also received a report early this year alleging that one of Garcia's sons was held at a US airport for failing to declare some 100,000 dollars he was carrying. An investigation found insufficient evidence to charge Garcia but an ombudsman probe then found cause to suspend the general, who now has 10 days to answer the charges. The ombudsman would then determine if there is probable cause to charge him in a special anti-graft court. Armed forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Lucero told AFP that Garcia's suspension was the first for a general "in contemporary times." The Philippine armed forces has been mired in allegations of graft and corruption that has often been the cause of instability within the institution. In 2003, a group of junior officers led around 300 men in a short-lived mutiny against President Gloria Arroyo, whom they accused of graft, and demanded the firing of top military officials. They had accused their senior officers of corruption and of allegedly enriching themselves while enlisted men died fighting insurgents without proper equipment. Arroyo crushed the rebellion in less than 24 hours however, and the detained officers have recently made a public apology saying that their action last year was misguided.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Thailand's tough-talking premier launched a second round of his controversial war on drugs by warning traffickers they will meet the "Prince of Hell" if they keep dealing, according to reports Monday. Thaksin Shinawatra kicked off the new year-long drug suppression campaign promising "brutal" new measures against dealers to follow on from a 2003 crackdown which left more than 2,000 people dead. "Nobody will be able to help them if they continue dealing in drugs," he was quoted by the Nation newspaper as telling residents of a low-income housing project in Bangkok on Sunday. "If they want to see the Prince of Hell, let me know," said Thaksin as he encouraged people aware of drug networks in their neighbourhoods to inform police. "Drug dealers and traffickers are heartless and wicked," Thaksin was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post. "These things are like cancer and we have to continue to keep a close watch on them." Thailand was criticised by governments, the UN and rights groups over the harsh tactics that peaked in early 2003, with claims of extrajudicial killings and arbitrary arrests, but the campaign had the overwhelming support of a public concerned over an epidemic of youth drug addiction. The kingdom was removed from a US international narcotics blacklist last month, a moved that the premier said was a vindication of the drugs war. In its second round, due to run until September next year, the government said it will focus on 1,400 communities particularly along its porous borders with Myanmar and Malaysia. Thaksin has announced a series of "wars" to tackle the nation's problems with the drug campaign coinciding with a month-long war on bird flu and one against corruption announced last week.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Singapore has issued its strongest response to Taiwan Foreign Minister Chen Tan-sun's description of the city state as a "booger", saying the comments were "extreme" and "painful". "This recent outburst is a source of some pain and sadness to us that it should come to this," Foreign Minister George Yeo said in comments published by the Straits Times on Monday. "We could disagree, but there's no need for some of these extreme actions." Yeo ignited Chen's fury when he delivered a lecture to the United Nations General Assembly on September 24 warning Taiwan it should not push for independence from China. "Even a country the size of a booger (bogey) brazenly criticized Taiwan and former president Lee Teng-hui in the United Nations," Chen responded on September 27 in the colourful Hokkien dialect that many people in both Taiwan and Singapore speak. "It was nothing but an effort to embrace China's 'balls', forgive me using such a word. What he said was to try to please China." While refusing to apologise, Chen has since explained he had dropped his diplomatic language in a bid to express his emotions to a group of Hokkien-speaking independence activists in terms they would be familiar with. "I tried to communicate with them using a language which I learned as a child. that moment was not a press conference aimed to criticise Singapore," he said last week But Yeo, speaking to local reporters on Saturday night, said he found the terms used by Chen as "a little strange", according to the Straits Times. He said that, as many Singaporeans are Hokkien, "we can relate to the words and phrases used". Singapore's foreign ministry issued a short statement last week in response to Chen's comments, describing them as "intemperate", but it was less emotional than Yeo's reaction. Yeo also reiterated Singapore's concerns over Taiwan's independence ambitions. "The way some of the pro-independence forces in Taiwan are pushing their way, this will have grave consequences for the future," the paper quoted him as saying. "The reason we take an interest in this subject is we have an over-riding interest in peaceful cross-strait relations. If they keep pushing, one day there will be war and the whole region will be engulfed." Beijing sees Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification -- by force if necessary. The two sides split at the end of a civil war in 1949. A Singapore foreign ministry spokeswoman was unavailable to speak with AFP on Monday to confirm Yeo's comments.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Three communist guerrillas were killed in a clash with Army Scout Rangers in the southern Philippines' Compostela Valley, the military said Monday. The troops were on routine combat patrol when they were ambushed by New People's Army (NPA) rebels near the valley's Libudon village, it said in a statement. Several automatic rifles left behind by the gunmen as well as a claymore mine and ammunition were also recovered. Last week, four policemen, two soldiers and a civilian were killed in NPA attacks across the country. The policemen were killed in an ambush in Baganga town in the southern island of Mindanao, while the soldiers were slain in an attack in the northern Philippines. The 8,600-strong NPA and its political leadership, the Communist Party of the Philippines, has been waging a 35-year Maoist armed campaign. The party announced in August that it was suspending peace talks with the government because of Manila's alleged failure to persuade Western countries to remove the rebels from their lists of international terrorists.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Patriots beat Bills for record-equalling 18th straight win.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ORCHARD PARK, New York, Oct 3 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Tom Brady threw for 298 yards and defensive end Richard Seymour scored a touchdown off a fumble as New England posted their record-tying 18th straight win with a 31-17 victory over Buffalo. New England (3-0) tied a record that includes playoff matches held by five teams - the Denver Broncos (1997-98), the San Francisco 49ers (1989-90), the Miami Dolphins (1972-73), and the Chicago Bears (1941-42 and 1933-34). "We don't care anything about a record," claimed Patriots coach Bill Belichick. "We were just trying to win another division game and we have another one coming up." Brady threw for two touchdowns and the Patriots sacked Drew Bledsoe seven times in Sunday's National Football League contest. "As coach would say, we're looking forward, we're not looking backward. This team focuses week to week. That's the only thing you can focus on," Brady said. "If you look back, teams are going to track you down and beat you." In other Sunday games, Atlanta found a way to get to 4-0 even with an ordinary Michael Vick by pounding the Panthers; the Jacksonville ran out of miracles and were stopped by the Colts and Philadelphia posted their fourth double-digit win. The Patriots won their final 12 regular-season games last year, three playoff matches and their first three games this season to get to 18. They can break the record at home next Sunday against lowly Miami. Bledsoe had problems escaping the Patriots' aggressive pass rush, especially in the second half. He lost his job to Brady in New England's first Super Bowl-winning season three years ago. Cornerback Kevin Mathis returned an interception 35 yards for a touchdown to lead Atlanta to a 27-10 win over Carolina in a battle of NFC South rivals. Atlanta outscored the Panthers, 91-14 in Vick's three previous starts against them. But in this one, Vick rushed for just 35 yards. "The running game opened up the passing game downfield," Vick said. "I'm not trying to do too much. I'm letting the game come to me. We did a great job of executing." Atlanta was able to establish a solid running game, intercepted Jake Delhomme twice and held DeShaun Foster to 51 yards on 19 carries Atlanta is 4-0 for only the second time in franchise history. The first was in 1986 when Dan Henning was the coach. Carolina (1-2) lost for the second time in as many home games. Meanwhile, Byron Leftwich again displayed some fourth-quarter magic, but it wasn't enough to beat Indianapolis. Edgerrin James' three-yard touchdown romp with 3:33 left in the final quarter lifted the Colts to a 24-17 victory over Jacksonville. The win was the third in a row for Indianapolis (3-1) following a season-opening loss at New England. It was the first loss of the season for the Jaguars (3-1). Jacksonville won its previous three games with late-game heroics. Last week, Fred Taylor's one-yard run with nine seconds left lifted the Jaguars to a 15-12 win at Tennessee. Two weeks ago, Jaguars linebacker Akin Ayodele recovered a fumble by Quentin Griffin at the Jacksonville 21 with 31 seconds left to ensure a 7-6 victory over the Denver Broncos. Tiki Barber rushed for 182 yards on 23 carries and tight end Jeremy Shockey caught the go-ahead four-yard touchdown pass with 12:07 left in the fourth quarter to lead the Giants to a 14-7 win over the Brett Favre's Green Bay Packers. Favre extended his NFL-record consecutive games streak for a quarterback to 193 regular-season games, but was unable to finish. The three-time MVP suffered a concussion when he was knocked down by defensive tackle William Joseph after throwing a pass early in the third quarter.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Six killed in fresh violence in India's northeastern Assam state.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[GUWAHATI, India, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Six people were killed and nine injured Monday in a fresh burst of violence in India's troubled northeast, taking the death toll in three days of rebel attacks to 69 with 210 injured, police said. Suspected rebels of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) entered a village in Assam state's Sonitpur district, some 180 kilometres (112 miles) from the main city Guwahati, in the early hours of Monday, a senior police official said. "The NDFB rebels woke up sleeping villagers and asked them to line up and started firing at them with automatic weapons," the official told AFP. "Six people died on the spot and nine more were seriously injured." The attack follows a wave of violence in Assam and neighbouring Nagaland state at the weekend which officials claim is aimed at disrupting New Delhi's peace initiative with major rebel groups in the region. Another four people injured in the string of blasts and gunfire attacks on Sunday died overnight, a police official in Guwahati said. The bloodletting coincides with the 18th anniversary of the founding of the NDFB, one of around 30 rebel groups fighting for greater autonomy or independence in the region. India's Home Minister Shivraj Patil said in Nagaland Sunday the government would take "very strong steps" to deal with militancy. "We will have to find a long-term solution to bring about an end to insurgency in the region," he said. The attacks have shattered the relative calm of mainly agricultural Nagaland, where a truce has been in force with the region's largest separatist group, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), since 1997. New Delhi and the NSCN have been holding discussions aimed at ending nearly six decades of insurgency in the state of two million. The group denied any hand in the blasts. Most of the rebel groups say they are seeking to protect their ethnic identities and allege the federal government has exploited the resources in the mineral and oil-rich region. Both the NDFB and the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) have claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in Assam. "The explosions are an answer to chief minister Tarun Gogoi's offer for a ceasefire," ULFA commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah was quoted as saying by local newspapers Monday. The NDFB had also claimed killing 14 shoppers in western Assam Saturday. Gogoi on Sunday called on the Indian government to pressure neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar to demolish the camps of militant groups on their soil. Dhaka denies the presence of any Indian rebels although New Delhi says many rebel groups in the northeast have camps in Bangladesh with which India shares a 4,095-kilometre (2,539-mile) -long border. Myanmar has repeatedly assured New Delhi it would take all measures to oust Indian rebels if they were in that country. Meanwhile, a 24-hour general strike Monday enforced by a tribal students group, the All Bodo Students' Union (ABSU), paralysed life in parts of Bodo tribal areas in western and northern Assam. More than 50,000 people have lost their lives to insurgency in the northeast since India's independence in 1947.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Two Chinese have been detained on suspicion of threatening six hotels with bomb attacks in the run-up to the National Day holiday in an attempt to extort money, state media said Monday. The hotels -- three of them in Beijing, and three in east China's Anhui province -- received anonymous calls late last week that they would be blown unless they paid 100,000 yuan (12,000 dollars), the Beijing News reported. The hotels evacuated their guests and alerted the police, which traced the phone calls to the area around Shangrao city in eastern Jiangxi province, according to the report. Police in Shangrao narrowed their search to two suspects, a driver surnamed Pan, who reportedly confessed to the crime, and his accomplice surnamed Zhang. Police in China's big cities have been on alert during the "Golden Week" National Day holiday, with a special focus on the risk of bomb attacks in crowded places like shopping malls and tourist sites, previous reports said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Ex-general poised to declare victory in Indonesian elections.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Former general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was Monday poised to declare victory in Indonesia's first ever direct presidential elections as the final votes were tallied to confirm his landslide win. With the count of ballot papers from the last of Indonesia's 32 provinces almost complete, officials said they may announce the result of the September 20 ballot later in the day. Representatives of Yudhoyono, who will be inaugurated as the country's sixth president on October 20, said the former general was expected to deliver a formal acceptance speech late Monday. With 110 million votes counted, he has already achieved an insurmountable lead, with 61 percent compared to incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri's 39 percent share of the vote. "The commission agreed that if the vote count can be completed today the official announcement will be made today," a commission spokesman said. The last province to submit election results Sunday night was West Irian Jaya. Neither Megawati nor her rival, who served as her security minister until earlier this year when he quit to enter the election race, has so far declared victory or conceded defeat although the outcome has been known for days. The election, Indonesia's third this year, was seen as a triumph for democracy in the country, six years after former dictator Suharto's fall plunged the country into political and economic uncertainty. Megawati, the daughter of founding president Sukarno, was credited with restoring economic stability to Indonesia, and had enjoyed immense popularity as a symbol of reform in the post-Suharto era. But voters deserted her in droves in the presidential polls, which were seen as a judgement on her failure to inject new life into the economy and a rejection of her image as an increasingly aloof and uncaring leader. Yudhoyono campaigned on a ticket of economic reform and battling corruption, but his polished appearance and common touch were seen as the key factors in winning over voters disillusioned with Megawati's hard edges. The former general, who as security minister led efforts to track down those blamed for the October 2002 Bali bombings, is also favoured by the international community which sees him as the best candidate to tackle Indonesia's growing terrorist threat. Indonesia has suffered three major attacks in two years, including the 2002 Bali bombing, where 202 people died, a blast last year at Jakarta's Marriott hotel in which 12 died and a suicide bombing last month at the Australian embassy in Jakarta in which nine people were killed. Those attacks and others have been blamed on the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah regional terrorist group.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A five-year-old Indonesian girl critically injured in last month's bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta flew to a new life in Italy on Monday after making a spectacular recovery at a Singapore hospital. Doctors at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital told reporters that Elisabeth Manuela Musu, nicknamed Manny, would probably achieve full recovery within three to six months. "She may be able to live like a normal child in a few months," neurosurgeon Ng Puay Yong said, just 13 days after she emerged from a coma. Manny had sustained significant injuries to her brain, abdomen and right side in the car bomb attack, which claimed the life of her mother and eight others, and doctors had initially given her a five percent chance of living. They had also warned that survival might come with permanent paralysis on her right side. But another surgeon involved in her recovery, Kenny Ee, said Monday she had already started moving her right arm and leg. Ee also described her outward demeanour as "cheerful". "If you see her with her two dads, she's smiling and laughing," Ee said. Manny was at the centre of a custody battle between her biological father, David Norman, and the Italian man who raised her from birth, Manual Musu. Manny's mother, Maria Eva Kumalawati, married Musu while she was pregnant with Manny, but Norman had claimed he was the girl's real father and undertook DNA tests to prove it before the car bombing. Manny, who holds Indonesian, Australian and Italian citizenships, was going to the Australian embassy on September 9, the day of the attack, to pick up her first Australian passport. The competing fathers resolved their custody dispute on Friday last week with Norman agreeing to let Manny live with Musu in Italy. Ee and Ng said both "fathers" had had played an important role in Manny's recovery by being very supportive throughout her hospital stay. Manny left the hospital on Monday tucked in the arms of Musu with both lying on a mobile bed, which was rolled out by a pair of Italian medics who will accompany them home. Manny, clad in a pink shirt and pants and a white hat, looked on somberly at the frenzy of cameramen and photographers as she departed, while Musu smiled but ignored reporters' requests for comment. Ee said that, despite her coma and statistics giving the initial gloomy predictions about her chances of survival, her remarkable recovery was not entirely surprising. "We've worked long enough to know that children have an amazing capability of recovery," he said. Ee said three pieces of shrapnel remain lodged in her abdomen, although they were not causing any problems and could be easily removed in future.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[France, Russia and China blocked US and British attempts to investigate corruption at the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq, because businesses from those nations were making billions of dollars from the program, according to a New York Times report. "France, Russia and China blocked inquiries into Iraq's manipulation of the program because their companies 'had much to gain from maintaining' the status quo," the Times said, citing a briefing paper prepared for a US Congressional panel. The House Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations is scheduled to hold a hearing Tuesday on how UN program managers and contractors addressed reports of abuses of the Oil-for-Food program. Speaking at the hearing will be representatives of Cotecna, the Switzerland-based company hired by the United Nations in 1999 to monitor goods shipped to Iraq; Saybolt International B.V., the Dutch company that monitored Iraqi oil exports; and BNP Paribas, the French bank that handled oil revenues under the program. "From the outset, this program was structurally vulnerable to manipulation and abuse by Saddams regime," panel chair Representative Christopher Shays said in a statement. "Over time, he learned how to exploit weaknesses in UN oversight of the program, confident his sympathizers on the Security Council would cynically look the other way." The UN office overseeing the program instructed contractors not to inspect goods flowing into and out of Iraq too rigorously, the briefing paper charges. It turned a blind eye to corruption because it saw oil-for-food "strictly as a humanitarian program". Several Congressional and UN panels are investigating the Oil-for-Food program, which operated from 1996 to 2003 in an effort to ease the impact of international sanctions on the Iraqi people. The program allowed Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil in order to purchase food and humanitarian items. The US Government Accountability Office recently concluded that Saddam Hussein's government stole more than 10 billion dollars from the program.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Cambodia's national assembly Monday ratified a law allowing a UN-backed trial of surviving Khmer Rouge leaders to go ahead, more than a year after a deal was struck between the government and global body. The agreement, delayed by a year-long political crisis that hamstrung parliament, outlines procedures on bringing to justice the ageing associates of Pol Pot, whose ultra-Maoist 1975-79 regime left up to two million people dead. "The national assembly has agreed to ratify the agreement between Cambodia and the United Nations on the law to try Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes committed under the Democratic Kampuchea regime," National Assembly president Prince Norodom Ranariddh told the session after an open vote. The passage of the law was seen as a key hurdle holding up the tribunal and attention is now focused on how the tribunal will be funded. Surviving Khmer Rouge leaders, now mostly in their seventies, have been cited for trial by scholars of genocide and crimes against humanity. Only two are in detention with others living freely in the country, while Khmer Rouge supremo Pol Pot died in 1998.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Election toy featuring "children overboard" withdrawn after protests.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CANBERRA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A bath toy intended to amuse infants with a stylised parody of the infamous "children overboard" incident that featured in Australia's 2001 election has been withdrawn from sale after complaints, its promoter said Monday. The toy, which was sold through an Internet website supposedly to benefit a candidate in the current election, featured a wooden boat carrying an inanely grinning peg figure of Prime Minister John Howard and a set of eight sad-faced asylum seeker figures. "Proven people's choice. Re-create history as only Johnny tells it," the promotional material said. "Quality SIEV X style bath boat with detachable children. Complete with little Johnny that can also be thrown overboard." In the "children overboard" incident, children were supposedly thrown overboard by their parents from a sinking wooden boat to win sympathy for their bid for asylum in Australia. The incident was the subject of a long-running senate inquiry that heard the goverment was well advised the children were not deliberately thrown overboard. But Howard has been accused of ignoring the advice when he later used photographs supposedly of the children at a news conference to denigrate asylum seekers and to say he did not want people like that coming to Australia. The incident is being used by Howard's opponents as part of a "truth in government" issue to try to embarrass his government in the current election campaign. According to the website, proceeds from the sale of the toy were to go towards former intelligence adviser Andrew Wilkie, who quit the service in protest against the government's decision to join the US-led invasion of Iraq last year. But the toy did not have the endorsement of Wilkie, who is standing as a Greens candidate in Howard's Sydney electorate of Bennelong. Andrew Bartlett, leader of the minor Australian Democrats party, said the toy was offensive and its sale should be stopped. He described its marketing as "appalling and offensive" in light of the fact that hundreds of asylum seekers, including 146 children, drowned when another boat, codenamed SIEV X, sank in October 2001. Website operator Ben Palmer said he withdrew the toy from sale after receiving a number of complaints and a call from Wilkie. "I wouldn't have taken it down but Mr. Wilkie asked me to take it down," said Palmer, who acknowledged he had no affiliation with the Greens or Wilkie. "If it's causing some grief then it's not worth doing."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Philippine share prices closed 3.60 percent higher Monday, rising sharply on the back of fresh foreign investor interest in the blue chips to the best finish in 55 months, dealers said. Investors increased their holdings in companies expected to enjoy strong earnings growth moving forward, allowing the composite index to break through resistance levels, first at 1,800 points and then at 1,850, they said. Sentiment was further boosted by Wall Street's sharp rise last Friday. The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index rose 64.35 points to 1,851.60 after trading between 1,798.07 and 1,853.29. Monday's finish was the best market since February 18, 2000, when the benchmark index closed at 1,884.28. Volume was 1.54 billion shares worth 1.56 billion pesos (27.85 milllion dollars) after Friday's 2.03 billion shares worth to 973.2 million pesos (17.3 million dollars). The broader all-shares index was up 24.94 points at 1,128.79. Gainers led losers 85 to 8, while 27 stocks were unchanged. "The bullish sentiment will possibly lift the market up to 1,900 points before the year ends. Some analysts are even looking at 2,000 points," said Lawrence de Leon of Accord Capital Equities. "Expectations of improving fundamentals in the next three months and even next year are driving investors to take more positions," he added. The market, however, was expected to undergo a technical correction along the way, he said, noting that concerns about high oil prices and the resulting build-up of inflationary pressures remain in place. Crude futures closed above the key 50 dollars level for the first time in New York, marking a gain of almost 3.0 percent for the week. Philippine Long Distance Telephone led the turnover list and was up 45 pesos at 1,465 pesos after its New York-listed American Depositary Receipts advanced 80 cents to 25.84 dollars on Friday. PLDT rival Globe Telecom rose 55 pesos to 1,175 pesos. Mall operator SM Prime Holdings was up 40 centavos at 7.00 pesos. Bank of the Philippine Islands was up 2.00 pesos at 48 pesos. Ayala Land rose 40 centavos to 7.10 pesos and Ayala Corp. added 20 centavos to 6.60 pesos. Manila Electric Co.'s B shares, available to foreign investors, rose 75 centavos to 25.50 pesos, while its A shares rallied 1.00 peso to 17 pesos.]]></c>

Mason capped an outstanding display when he was named as the winner of the Clive Churchill Medal for the best player in the Grand Final. "I am looking forward to coaching Willie Mason," national coach Wayne Bennett said Monday. "He's been very, very good. I think when (skipper) Steve Price got injured in the major preliminary game Willie stood up for his team." Selectors included seven new Test caps in the Australian side which will play New Zealand and Great Britain twice before a Tri-Nations final at Elland Road, Leeds, on November 27. Ryan, O'Meley and Tonga join North Queensland Cowboys fullback Matt Bowen, Brisbane Broncos utility forward Tonie Carroll, Penrith Panthers winger Luke Rooney and St. George Illawarra centre Matt Cooper as Australian newcomers. The Roosters are represented by four players -- forwards Michael Crocker, Craig Fitzgibbon, fullback Anthony Minichiello and hooker Craig Wing. Brisbane is best represented in coach Wayne Bennett's squad with six players -- captain and standoff Darren Lockyer, Carroll, utility back Shaun Berrigan, prop Petero Civoniceva, centre Brent Tate and prop Shane Webcke. The most notable omissions were Penrith forwards Joel Clinton and Trent Waterhouse and St George-Illawarra utility Shaun Timmins. The selectors had planned to take a 23-man squad on tour but expanded it to 25 players. "Initially, we talked about 23 but through the process we realised we were short in some areas and we asked for the squad to be expanded to 25," Bennett told reporters. "We didn't want a situation we had last year when Darren Smith (then playing for an English club) was called into the Australian team (during the Ashes Test series in England). "We wanted to avoid that at all costs. You have to take a couple of fullbacks, you have to take two five-eighths (flyhalves), so it was more practical to have 25. He added: "New Zealand are going to have a very strong team. (Great Britain) obviously fancy themselves. I think it's going to be a wonderful competition." Australia launch their Tri-Nations series against New Zealand in Auckland on October 16. Australia - Backs: Shaun Berrigan (Brisbane), Matt Bowen (North Queensland), Matt Cooper (St George Illawarra), Craig Gower (Penrith), Scott Hill (Melbourne), Brett Kimmorley (Cronulla), Darren Lockyer (Brisbane - captain), Anthony Minichiello (Sydney Roosters), Luke Rooney (Penrith), Matt Sing (North Queensland), Brent Tate (Brisbane), Willie Tonga (Canterbury). Forwards: Danny Buderus (Newcastle), Tonie Carroll (Brisbane), Petero Civoneciva (Brisbane), Michael Crocker (Sydney Roosters), Craig Fitzgibbon, (Sydney Roosters), Nathan Hindmarsh (Parramatta), Ben Kennedy (Newcastle), Willie Mason (Canterbury), Mark O'Meley (Canterbury), Andrew Ryan (Canterbury), Jason Ryles (St George Illawarra), Shane Webcke (Brisbane), Craig Wing (Sydney Roosters).]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Girl becomes 11th Thai bird flu fatality.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An eight-year-old girl has died of bird flu in northern Thailand, becoming the country's 11th confirmed victim of the lethal virus this year, health officials said Monday. "She fell ill last Thursday and was admitted to hospital Sunday before she died that night," Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told reporters. The girl, from Phetchabun province, was the third Thai to die during a new wave of outbreaks that started in July. At least 19 people have also died of bird flu in Vietnam since December last year and millions of birds have died or been culled across Asia. The girl, who was not named by officials, was taken to hospital with a fever last week after eight of the family's chickens died and was confirmed Sunday as having the lethal H5N1 form of the virus. The girl lived in a poorly ventilated one-storey house and helped pluck chickens after her grandmother slaughtered them for cooking, according to a health ministry statement. "Friends discouraged her without any success," it said. One thousand chickens in the village were to be culled late Sunday. Sudarat said chickens in the girl's village, in Chon Daen district about 330 kilometres (205 miles) north of Bangkok, "have been dying since early last month while chickens at the girl's house died around mid-September". It was not immediately clear how Thai authorities initially learned of or dealt with the poultry deaths. Last month Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra criticised the health and agriculture ministries for not doing enough to stem the outbreaks, and said local authorities should have announced suspicious poultry deaths more quickly. Tests and monitoring of the girl's relatives, neighbours, classmates and hospital staff has been undertaken, Sudarat added. Thai officials last week confirmed its first probable case of human-to-human infection of bird flu following the deaths of a mother and daughter. Tests are still continuing to try to confirm that the daughter had flu -- she was cremated before full tests could be carried out -- and to discover if the disease had mutated into a more contagious and lethal form that could trigger a wider health crisis. A mutated bird flu outbreak was blamed for the deaths of as many as 40 million people worldwide in 1918. Thai health officials said early indications were that the strain had not changed much. Meanwhile Thai media reported Monday that laboratory tests confirmed the bird flu virus had been discovered in dogs northeast of Bangkok. Health officials said they could not verify the reports, although the health minister expressed concern over possible infection of mammals. "I'm worried about a broader spread of the virus into mammals because theori the bird flu crisis hit, also said it would overhaul its system of farming to try to prevent future crises.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Singapore opposition leader Chee Soon Juan vowed Monday to press on with efforts to cross-examine former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong in court over a bitter defamation battle. Chee, leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, has already lost the defamation suit over comments he made in the 2001 election campaign but is seeking to reconvene a damages hearing and a chance to challenge Lee and Goh. "I'm just making sure that as much as possible I just want to hit both Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Goh Chok Tong at the stand for cross-examination," Chee told reporters after appearing at the High Court on Monday. "I do want to call for them because I did not have a chance to get them on the stand and be able to even call other witnesses in my defence." Davinder Singh, the lawyer for Goh and Lee, has said Chee will likely have to pay at least 500,000 US dollars in damages for defaming the pair. In the High Court on Monday, Chee agreed to submit evidence on October 13 supporting his call for the hearing to be reconvened, after he missed the earlier proceedings last month because he was abroad. The High Court has asked him to explain his absence in order to support his call for a new hearing. Chee, a US-trained psychologist, has consistently pushed for greater political freedoms in Singapore and been a high-profile thorn in the side of the People's Action Party despite his party having no members of parliament. His defamatory comments came when he asked then-prime minister Goh during a street campaign to account for a 10 billion US dollar loan offered by the government to Indonesian president Suharto during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998. Goh and Lee, who both remain influential ministers in Cabinet, have pointed out the loan was never disbursed and said Chee's statements implied they were dishonest. Goh and Lee have been criticised for regularly using defamation suits to silence critics, but the pair have defended their legal actions as a fair way of protecting their reputations.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Hundreds of chickens at a farm in Indonesia have died of a strain of bird flu that is potentially deadly to humans, a report said Monday. An official said lab tests showed that 350 chickens at the farm at Kranggan Harjo on the central island of Java have died of the H5N1 virus, a lethal strain, which has killed at least 30 people in Southeast Asia this year. "The bird flu virus was of the H5N1 strain," the local head of the animal husbandry office, Gembong Murdowo, was quoted by the Jakarta Post daily. There was no immediate confirmation from officials. Harjo said the carcasses of the dead chickens had been burned to prevent the virus from spreading. At least 30 people have died of bird flu in Vietnam and Thailand since the start of a major outbreak late last year. No Indonesians are known to have been infected by the virus. Indonesia in July launched a major vaccination programme to eradicate bird flu which was lingering in some districts. Officials said the virus had resurfaced because some farmers had neglected procedures by using illegal vaccines and restocking their poultry too early. Thai officials last week confirmed its first probable case of human-to-human infection of bird flu following the deaths of a mother and daughter. A variation of bird flu was blamed for the deaths of as many as 40 million people worldwide in 1918.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Singapore scientists working to develop an edible vaccine for viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) have found a breakthrough in milk, media reports said Monday. Researchers have successfully immunised mice from a virus similar to SARS by feeding them with genetically modified lactic acid bacteria, which is found in cultured milk drinks, the Straits Times reported. This could mean that in a few years, doctors will be able to dispense a SARS vaccine that could simply be eaten or drunk, the prinicipal investigator of the study, associate professor Lee Yuan Kun, told the paper. "This will bypass people's fear of needles and the need for trained staff to do injections, and is a cheap and effective way to do mass immunisation," the paper quoted him as saying. "The idea is that if you can drink it or eat it, it will reach a wider audience, particularly in developing countries which need them the most." The scientists first cloned a surface protein of a virus belonging to the coronavirus family that includes SARS, into lactobacillus casei bacteria. Mice that were fed the concoction were seen to develop antibodies that protected them from subsequent infections. The research team, which has been working on the project for three years, has already performed a similar cloning of the SARS virus into bacteria and yeast cells. Testing on animals will be done soon, with clinical testing to follow in a few years, Lee told the paper. SARS killed nearly 800 people and infected more than 8,000 worldwide last year, with 33 of the casualties coming from Singapore. The United States and China are also developing "traditional" injection-delivered vaccines, with China already testing the results on volunteers.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The dollar firmed in largely technical Asian trade Monday as market participants saw no surprises from the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven countries, dealers said. They said the market is now looking ahead to Friday's release of the key US jobs data for September. The dollar was at 110.69 yen in Tokyo afternoon trade, up from 110.52 yen in New York Friday.

"There was no surprise in the statement by the G7 at the weekend."

		<c><![CDATA[Nine people, including women and children, were killed in two pre-dawn raids by US planes on suspected rebel targets in Fallujah, west of Baghdad on Monday, according to a local hospital. Doctor Adel Khamis of Fallujah general hospital said that the second of the two strikes killed nine people, three of them women and two children. He said that 14 people were wounded in the strike, while no casualties were reported in the first raid. The area is a theocratic enclave virtually inaccessible to foreign reporters and death tolls provided by one side or the other cannot be verified independently. A military statement said US forces "conducted a precision strike against a building where approximately 25 anti-Iraqi forces network members were moving weapons on the outskirts of Fallujah." In a second raid, "Multi-National Force-Iraq once again struck members of the Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi terrorist network operating in central Fallujah," the military said. "In the last month, Multi-National Forces have successfully conducted ten offensive strikes on the Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi terrorist network. Each action removed foreign fighters from the streets of Fallujah and strengthens the safety of Iraq," the US statement said. A senior US military source claimed last week that more than 100 Zarqawi operatives had been killed in recent weeks in strikes on Fallujah, a no-go zone for ground troops. The Jordanian-born Zarqawi is the most wanted man in Iraq and heads the Tawhid wal Jihad (Unity and Holy War) group responsible for a string of deadly attacks and kidnappings. A recent report by the Iraqi government estimated that the Zarqawi network had between 1,000 and 1,500 members across the country, with 500 in Fallujah alone.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rising oil prices are unlikely to deal a major blow to global economic growth although the trend may seem "uncomfortable," a researcher with the International Monetary Fund said Monday. The recent economic soft patch in the global economy was "desirable" to allow adjustments following a high growth period from late last year through to early this year, said David Robinson, IMF deputy director of research. "While the effects of rising oil prices are uncomfortable, it's so far manageable. It's going to slow the global economy but it's not going to stall it," Robinson told reporters. This year will be "a banner year for global growth," he added. The IMF projects the world economy will grow five percent, a 30-year high, this year before cooling off to 4.3 percent in 2005. The outlook for oil is uncertain but market indications are they could fall to around 35 dollars in the next few years and that level is "not enough to change our forecasts" of solid global growth, Robinson said. "Looking forward, our assessment is that the soft patch will only be a soft patch, not a sink hole," he said. Solid corporate profits in the United States should be followed by an upturn in investment there, driving the global economy ahead as a result, he said, although he added that weak US jobs data could mean slower consumption. Japan also is forecast to continue growth, albeit at a slower 2.3 percent next year, down from an estimated 4.4 percent, the best among the Group of Seven industrial economies. "This recovery is not like the recoveries we have seen in the (1990s). This is more broadly based," Robinson said. "Corporate and bank restructurings have moved forward," he said, adding that those sectors have become "more resilient to shocks" such as rising oil prices.]]></c>

The NZSX-50 gross index gained 4.39 points to 2,858.11 on turnover worth 104.35 million New Zealand dollars (69.33 million US dollars). Gainers led losers 53 to 44 with 165 stocks traded. It was a "pretty reasonable turnover for a Monday" and despite a public holiday in much of Australia, said Forsyth Barr broker Suzanne Kinnaird. Kinnaird said Wall Street's gains Friday helped underpin trade, as well as a three cent rise in Telecom to 5.99 dollars "possibly on the back of comment they were looking to increase their dividend payout beyond 85 percent". Telecom chief financial officer Marko Bogoievski told a conference in New York that Telecom's dividend payout could go to 90 percent of profits at the end of next financial year. Elsewhere, Carter Holt Harvey rose two cents at 2.33 dollars.

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korean industrial output growth slowed to 10.6 percent in August, with strong overseas shipments undercut by continued sluggish domestic demand, official data showed Monday. The August outcome, compared to growth of 13 percent in July, was the lowest since January, reflecting sluggish domestic demand and weak wholesale and retail sectors, the National Statistical Office said. Wholesale and retail sales in August fell 1.5 percent year-on-year, after rising 0.3 percent in July, ending two consecutive months of gains. Domestic construction orders fell 39.2 percent in August, the biggest drop since March 1999, casting a shadow over hopes for a recovery in domestic demand. Factories ran at 78.7 percent of capacity in August down from 79.7 percent. Investment in plant and equipment rose five percent year-on-year after a 2.3 percent gain in July. Domestic shipments grew 2.7 percent in August, compared to 5.9 percent in July, while overseas shipments were up 21.5 percent after 21.8 percent. The August data showed that domestic consumption is not recovering fast enough to take up the slack from slower growth in exports, Korea Investment Trust Securities economist Kim Jae-Eun said. "It looks like the time is right for a turnaround in domestic demand but the pace of actual recovery is very slow. not fast enough to make up for slower exports growth," she said. Kim said there was a case for another interest rate cut to get local demand moving again, the saying the economy is in "a state of stalled growth." Last month, the government introduced tax cuts and other incentives to encourage private spending after the Bank of Korea cut its key interest rate to an all time low of 3.5 percent. "The policy focus should be on boosting domestic demand rather than on curbing prices," Kim said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two Indonesian families have claimed to be related to two women held hostage in Iraq as frantic efforts continued to secure their release on Monday. Officials, who hope relatives will be able to record appeals for the release of the two women, said they were looking into the claims. The two Indonesians were pictured in video footage shot by a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq and aired on Arab television. The abductors demanded the release of a militant cleric being held in Indonesia. A man in the eastern Java district of Banyuwangi identified one of the hostages as his wife Istiqomah binti Misnad, the Indo.Pos daily said. "I'm sure it's my wife. Her shirt is exactly the same as the one she used to wear in Banyuwangi," Sugianto, 32, was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Separately, a woman who lived in the eastern Java city of Malang said she believed the other hostage was her granddaughter named Novitasari, who had worked in the Middle East for two years. Foreign ministry spokesman Yuri Thamrin said officials were checking the information with employment agencies which sent Istiqomah and Novitasari. "We are verifying the information," he said. The two Indonesian hostages, both pictured wearing Islamic headscarves, were identified as Rosidah binti Anom and Rafikah binti Aming in a written statement sent by the abductors to the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera television network. Foreign ministry officials said migrant workers often changed their names and faked their ages. President Megawati Sukarnoputri appeared on Arab television on Saturday calling for the women's release. "I sincerely ask in my own name, in the name of the state, in the name of the Indonesian government, that they be immediately freed from the hands of the hostage-takers so they can go home again to their families," she said. Calls for their freedom were also made by Abu Bakar Bashir, the Indonesian cleric whom the abductors demanded be released from the jail where he is being held as accused leader of the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group. Bashir has condemned the kidnappers and said the abduction was against Islam. Sugianto, a pedicab driver, said his wife was promised work in Saudi Arabia by an employment agency but she wrote to him seven months ago from Jakarta that she was leaving for Iraq.]]></c>

Le Figaro said the report called for Turkey's application to be subject to much stricter controls than that of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined earlier this year. Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul later Monday rejected any suggestion of "special conditions" for Turkey. "That is out of the question," he said. A spokesman for EU enlargement commissioner Guenter Verheugen, whose office is preparing the report, refused Monday to comment on the plethora of leaks, saying only that "we will see on Wednesday." EU leaders agreed in Copenhagen two years to decide in December 2004 whether or not to start accession talks. But opponents of Turkish membership have long argued that Turkey is simply too big and too different to fit into the EU. Verheugen said last month that "no obstacles remain on the table" after resolving a week-long conflict last month about Turkish plans -- later abandoned -- to criminalize adultery. Olli Rehn, who takes over from Verheugen next month, said Monday that the European Commission will recommend that the EU should start entry talks with Turkey but will stress the need for a mechanism to monitor reforms. The next head of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, meanhwile said he welcomed the idea of referendums in EU member countries on the issue of Turkey's possible future accession. "It is a mistake to assume that a decision of this importance can be taken against the will of Europeans," said Barrosso.]]></c>

The Japanese trading house accuses CLR's then-chairman Roy Leighton along with managing director William Bradwell and finance director Philip Gamble of knowledge and dishonesty in relation to the trades. CLR says its lawyers will argue in defence that it had no reason to believe that Hamanaka was not authorised to do the trades he was doing, stressing that Sumitomo held him out as a star employee. It says it reported to Sumitomo in great detail every trade that it cleared for the Japanese trading house. Sumitomo has reached settlements with a number of other major banks, including JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch, after filing a clutch of lawsuits. Credit Agricole acquired CLR when it bought the parent company Credit Lyonnais in 2003, folding the London brokerage business into its investment banking arm, now called Calyon.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A failed operation by a French MP to free two French reporters held hostage in Iraq triggered a flurry of angry finger-pointing in Paris Monday, as the families of the pair appealed for calm ahead of a new attempt. Didier Julia, a 70-year-old member of President Jacques Chirac's ruling UMP party, was expected to defiantly defend his freelance mission when he returned to the French capital late Monday after spending four days in the Syrian capital of Damascus overseeing the liberation efforts. The government, meanwhile, held an emergency meeting to discuss developments and examine the possible outcomes for reporters Georges Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Christian Chesnot of Radio France International, who were abducted south of Baghdad August 20 along with their Syrian driver. The three men are believed to be in the hands of an insurgent group calling itself the Islamic Army of Iraq. Julia earned the reprobation of France last Friday, when he declared there was a convoy carrying the journalists out of Iraq -- along with his associate, a former French navy commando named Philippe Brett who he said had arranged their release -- but it failed to materialise. Julia's assertions revealed inconsistencies and raised questions about the extent the MP might have colality and with French residency papers, was also on the flight, "with bags of money," according to one unnamed source. Le Monde and other newspapers speculated that Gbagbo might have been involved to warm relations with France that have been chilled over the course of a two-year civil war in Ivory Coast, the murder of a French journalist there by a policeman in October last year and the disappearance in April this year of a Franco-Canadian reporter. Chirac's spokesman, Jerome Bonnafont, rejected the thrust of Le Monde's investigation, saying French officials "never approved, nor backed the personal initiative of Didier Julia and his collaborators." He added that "much information is being transmitted to French authorities" about the hostages. Each lead is weighed carefully, he said, but information Julia provided on September 27 about his operation was too "imprecise" to warrant a response. Chesnot and Malbrunot's families issued a statement Monday asking "all of France's representative figures to not get into debates that could undermine the national consensus and, at the same time, have consequences on the liberation of Christian and Georges." They called on "the responsibility and discretion of everybody so that negotiations resume in the necessary calm."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri held talks in Damascus and with the Lebanese opposition on Monday as part of consultations for a new government of national union amid international concern over Syria's domination of the country. "Hariri made a round-trip" for talks with Syrian officials in Damascus, a government source who asked not to be identified told AFP. Lebanon hft a more just electoral law ahead of the legislative polls due in 2005 and the country have more balanced relations with Syria. Earlier, Hariri's deputy said the prime minister was likely to head the next government and that the current cabinet will stay on in a caretaker capacity for the time being. "The cabinet will be in a position to resign once the details of the new government, which will probably be entrusted to Hariri, are known," Deputy Prime Minister Issam Fares told reporters. In the meantime he said it was important for ministers to remain at their posts to "handle immediate business". "Hariri is aware that the current phase is crucial and he is making contacts with all parties" about the makeup of the new government, said Fares. "Based on these consultations, measures will be adopted." In Syria on Monday, President Bashar al-Assad sacked eight cabinet members, including the holder of the key post of interior minister that went to the head of Syria's political security service, General Ghazi Kanaan. The appointment of Kanaan, long-time director of Syrian military intelligence in Lebanon, was seen by diplomats in Damascus as a sign Syria was preparing to return to a more pragmatic policy towards its smaller neighbour.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ROME, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Italy on Monday intensified a get-tough policy on illegal immigration as the drowning of migrants off the Tunisian coast highlighted the tragic plight of those seeking a new life in "fortress Europe". Faced with a fresh wave of immigration in recent weeks, Rome continued an expulsion drive which at the weekend saw around 1,000 migrants marched onto planes bound for Libya, from the ports and beaches of which they launched their attempt to enter Europe. An Alitalia plane carrying 90 migrants took off from the island of Lampedusa on Monday bound for Libya, a police source told AFP, even as a fresh wave of migrants, around 200 people, was reported to be about to land on the Mediterranean island. The flight was the 11th ordered by the interior ministry since Friday, part of a new policy introduced by Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisanu. He insisted immediate repatriation was the only way to tackle the "emergency" and send the message to people-trafficking gangs in North Africa, which he said were "pitilessly exploiting" desperate migrants. But the new rapid expulsion policy leaves no time for would-be immigrants to file claims for political asylum, provoking angry criticism from opposition parties and causing one cabinet mcountries of origin. The two ministers held telephone discussions on Monday which focused on the problem. The expulsion drive only concerns Tunisians, Egyptians and nationals of nearby countries, the source told AFP. He said Libya would not accept returnees who were not from a neighbouring country and thus relatively easy to repatriate. "Sudanese, Eritreans, Ethiopians and nationals of undetermined origin are not involved and have been sent to temporary detention centres in Italy," the source said. At the weekend, 17 would-be immigrants drowned and 47 were missing after a boat heading for Italy broke up and sank off the Tunisian coast, the luckless victims of a sea journey often fraught with danger. Green deputy Paolo Cento, who is vice-chairman of the Italian parliament's justice committee, called for the "immediate suspension" of what he called "mass deportations" and accused Pisanu of "serious violations of humanitarian conventions". Asylum claims arptember, officials said 10,000 illegal immigrants had arrived in the country since January. More than 1,000 have arrived on Lampedusa in the last few days. Ironically, Italy relies increasingly heavily on immigrants to meet a labour shortfall in industry, agriculture and tourism, and Pisanu's interior ministry is faced with maintaining a delicate balance. The farmers' union Coldiretti has called on the government to allow an extra 16,000 immigrants into the country to help with crop-harvesting, in addition to a government-established immigrant quota of 79,500 for 2004.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NAIROBI, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Kenyan pharmaceutical company said Monday it had reached a deal with a second western drug producer to make generic versions of a patented antiretroviral (ARV) drug. "Last week, we reached an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim (of Germany) that allows us to start making Nevirapine," Prakash Patel, managing director of Cosmos Limited, told AFP by telephone. Nevirapine is one of three drugs that are combined into a single tablet used as the primary HIV treatment in Kenya, where Boehringer Ingelheim holds the patent for it. It also helps prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and for this use, which only requires a one-off dosage to the mother, Boehringer supplies it free to many African countries, including Kenya. "We will start to make the drug any time after we finalise with our logistics," explained Patel. Last month, Cosmos struck a similar voluntary licencing deal with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline to make generic versions of two other antiretroviral molecules, one of which is used in the single tablet combination recommended in Kenya. The third drug in this combination, which Cosmos plans to start producing soon, is not under patent in Kenya and can be manufactured freely. Patel said that Cosmos would be selling its antiretroviral drugs in Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda as well as Kenya. AIDS has killed about 1.5 million people since 1984 in Kenya. About seven percent of Kenya's 32 million inhabitants are estimated to be infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. Although Africa is the world's worst AIDS-affected region, few of its countries produce ARVs. Producers in South Africa have reached voluntary licencing deals with patent-holders while the governments of Mozambique and Zambia have invoked their right under World Trade Organisation rules to grant local manufacturers production licences without the consent of patent-holders. Also under WTO rules, many African states, Kenya included, import generic ARVs produced in India.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Manchester United -- the richest and possibly most famous football club.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Manchester United, which said Monday it had received a takeover approach, stands as the richest and one of the most famous football club's in the world, 126 years after being formed by railway workers. Queen Victoria still had another 23 years on the British throne when Manchester United was founded in 1878, under the name of Newton Heath LYR (Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway). The club struggled financially early on and was saved from extinction by a local brewery owner, which led in 1902 to the club being renamed Manchester United. One hundred and two years later, Manchester United Plc said it has received a preliminary takeover approach, following reports that American sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer was plotting to seize control. Weekend press reports suggested that multi-millionaire Glazer, who holds a 19.2-percent stake in the club, was poised to launch a takeover bid for the English giants, worth at least 650 million pounds (943 million euros, 1.17 billion dollars). Manchester United Plc, which owns the football club, was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, just as the team was to begin its most successful era on the pitch. Between 1991 and 2004 the United football team, managed by Alex Ferguson, won eight English Premiership titles, four English FA Cups and the Champions League once. Such success has helped to turn Manchester United into the richest club in the world but fame struck much earlier. After a rather indifferent first 75 years, United hit the headlines in 1952 when, managed by Matt Busby, it won the English league championship for the first time since 1911. His team, known as the Busby Babes because it included so many talented youngsters, went on to dominate English football, before tragedy struck in February 1958. On returning from Belgrade, where they had played a European Cup tie, eight players were killed when their plane crashed after refuelling in Munich. Among the dead was Duncan Edwards, who in 1953 had become the English First Division's youngest-ever player aged 16 years and 185 days. Busby survived the crash and went on to build a second great United team, including world class players such as Bobby Charlton, George Best and Denis Law, which won the European Cup in 1968. The next 20 years were less rosy until Ferguson worked his magic. With constant success on the pitch, helped by world-class players such as Eric Cantona, Roy Keane and Ryan Giggs, the club looked to maximise profits. It increased seating capacity at its Old Trafford stadium to almost 70,000, created its own television and radio stations and embarked on lucrative summer tours to the United States and Asia. Manchester United currently enjoys huge sponsorship deals with Nike and Vodafone and earns millions of pounds per year from merchandise, putting their name to financial products, including mortgages, and from their matches being shown around the globe live on television. United, meanwhile, are not about to rest on their laurels. They are soon to increase capacity at Old Trafford to more than 75,000 seats and have just splashed out 27 million pounds on England's 18-year-old striker Wayne Rooney. As Henk Potts, analyst at Barclays Stockbrokers said: "The club has been able to manage the great balancing act of being able to perform on the pitch as well as produce returns for shareholders."]]></c>

Faced with a fresh wave of immigration in recent weeks, Rome accelerated an expulsion drive which at the weekend saw around 1,000 immigrants marched onto planes bound for Libya, where they had come from. Konare "disapproves and condemns the recent expulsion of African immigrants by the government of Italy," according to an AU statement sent to AFP in Nairobi. Several more flights were scheduled to leave Italy on Monday to take hundreds more migrants back to the North African country, some within hours of their arrival on Italy's shores aboard leaky, overcrowded boats. Konare "stressed the need for the observance of human and humanitarian rights of immigrants, principles of which are less and less observed by authorities of host countries," the statement added. "Systematic expulsions cannot be a sustained and praiseworthy policy," it said, citing Konare. The pan-African body called for a "frank and sincere" dialogue between countries of origin, transit and host, in order to draw up "an immigration policy which takes into account the interests and dignity of Africa and Africans."]]></c>

"The butcher Sharon would not have committed these crimes had he known that the disarmed Palestinian people were backed by live governments," a party statement said of the massive offensive ordered by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon against the Gaza Strip nearly a week ago. "Arab governments rush to denounce (Palestinian) suicide operations. and mobilise their ranks to win the release of hostages in Iraq but they are silent like tombs when faced by Sharon's crimes," the IAF said.

		<c><![CDATA[The UN refugee agency on Monday said it was deeply concerned at the expulsion of migrants who had recently arrived on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa after crossing from Africa. In a statement, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) "expressed deep concern over the fate of hundreds of new arrivals" on the Mediterranean island. It said many of them were reportedly being sent back to Libya without proper evaluation of any claims of persecution made by individual migrants. The agency called for access to the new arrivals to oversee asylum requests. "We recognise the very strong pressures that these continuing arrivals are generating, but all those who request asylum should have access to a fair procedure to assess their possible protection needs under the 1951 Refugee Convention," said Raymond Hall, director of the UNHCRs Europe bureau. "UNHCR should have access to them and we stand ready to assist Italian authorities in ensuring that those who do need protection get it," he added. Italy on Monday accelerated an expulsion drive which at the weekend saw about 1,000 immigrants marched onto planes bound for Libya, where they had come from. Hall said he was also waiting for a response from Libyan authorities after the agency asked to monitor the situation of those who had been returned to Libya. Italian officials have told agency staff that people were being sorted by nationality. Arrivals from Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia were being granted the asylum process while others, thought to be mainly Egyptians, were expelled to Libya. "UNHCR is concerned that this method of sorting by nationality could put individual cases in need of international protection at risk and lead to direct or indirect refoulement (expulsion) of refugees," the statement said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Profiles of Republican Vice President Dick Cheney and Democratic challenger Senator John Edwards who will take in a debate Tuesday of vice-presidential candidates ahead of the November 2 US election: DICK CHENEY Demonised by Democrats, Dick Cheney is widely seen as the eminence grise of President George W. Bush and is one of the most powerful vice presidents in American political history. Cheney was sent into a White House bunker after the September 11, 2001 attacks and has kept a low profile for much of the Bush administration. He has been one of the hardline defenders of the Iran invasion and mired in controversy over past links to Halliburton, the oil services giant that has huge US military contracts. But when Cheney speaks, the sparks often fly and his comments nearly always make news. Under pressure after months of Democratic criticism over Halliburton, a company he ran until joining the Bush campaign in 2000, Cheney used the F-word in June against Democratic senator Patrick Leahy. He annoyed the Democratic campaign last month by strongly hinting that the United States would face a bigger threat of a new September 11-style attack if voters choose Democrat John Kerry for president on November 2. "Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole. It's a nice way to operate, actually," Cheney said of himself in a rare interview with American newspapers in January. Cheney has, however, also shown an ability to shock even American conservatives, coming out in favour of gay marriages after years of opposition. His eldest daughter is a lesbian. Cheney has decades of experience in Washington power politics. He was the defence secretary during the 1991 Gulf War and a chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, a member of the House of Representatives. Cheney was head of a committee looking for a vice presidential candidate for Bush. The committee decided he would be the best candidate. Despite his fragile health after several heart attacks, disquiet about the Halliburton controversy and Democrat attacks on the way he avoided Vietnam war service, Bush has insisted that Cheney remains his trusted number two. "I admit it, he's not the prettiest face in the race," the president has said of Cheney. "I didn't pick him for his looks. I picked him for his judgment, his experience, his ability to get the job done." JOHN EDWARDS Youthful, optimistic, but with relatively little political experience, John Edwards, the Democratic contender for the vice presidency, is almost completely the opposite to Cheney. Edwards earned a fortune as a personal injury trial lawyer -- an area in which the Bush administration wants to clamp down on huge awards made. He turned to politics after the death of his 16-year-old son winning a senate seat for North Carolina at his first attempt s in the battle against Bush. Edwards was born June 10, 1953 in South Carolina and raised in neighbouring North Carolina, the state he represents in the US Senate. At 11, he wrote a school essay "Why I Want to Be a Lawyer." His mission: to rise from his modest origins and "protect innocent people from blind justice the best I can." He proved a brilliant attorney, representing parents who lost their children in botched hospital deliveries, and children who lost their parents in car wrecks. Edwards once convinced a jury to award 25 million dollars to a nine-year-old girl who was severely injured in a badly built swimming pool. Success came swiftly in politics. He dispatched an incumbent Republican senator in the 1998 election.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[HAMPTON, New Hampshire, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democratic nominee John Kerry Monday accused President George W. Bush of sacrificing life-saving science for right-wing dogma as he joined ailing Hollywood star Michael J. Fox to skewer Republican curbs on stem cell research. Kerry, riding high after several opinion polls suggested he had erased Bush's opinion poll lead ahead of their second head-to-head debate on Friday, held a rally in a school in New Hampshire. "The president has made the wrong choice, to sacrifice science for extreme right-wing ideology and that is unacceptable," said Kerry, as he accused the administration of drastically stem cell research. Supporters say research on embryonic stem cells could lead to a cure for patients living with diseases like Alzheimers, diabetes, and terminal leukaemia and some types of cancer. "Back to the Future Star" Fox, now stricken with Parkinson's disease, said Bush's Republicans had severely limited the number of stem-cell lines available for research for purely ideologial reasons. "George W. Bush has made the wrong decision on stem-cell research, we are very excited that John Kerry will get us back on track," said the Canadian-born star, shaking perceptibly from his symptoms. The Bush campaign however hit back at Kerry, accusing him of misleading Americans over Bush's policy on stem-cell research. "John Kerry has made a repeated effort to mislead the press and the public on the reality of the new federal funding for stem cell research that the President announced in August 2001," said a White House statement. "It is inaccurate to say the president 'limited federal funding' of stem cell research, as such funding did not exist to limit." Bush announced in April 2001 that he had made 60 stem cell lines available to federal researchers. But opponents claim many have proved to have no scientific value, and that his policy is nothing but a political fudge to placate an ideologically conservative base opposed to research on embryonic material. Bush's program only permitted funding for work on embryonic stem cells that had already been destroyed. Opponents argue that tens of thousands of frozen stem cells in existence could be used to find a cure to deadly diseases.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices fell back from record highs Monday, ducking below 50 dollars in New York as fears of disruption to supplies from Nigeria receded after a peace deal between rival gangs in the oil-rich Niger Delta. The price of light sweet crude for November delivery fell 32 cents to 49.80 dollars a barrel in early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November slipped 39 cents to 46.23 dollars in late afternoon deals. "The main news is the Nigerian one," said Lee Elliott, a trader with GNI-Man Financial. "There is a small resolution. A deal has been struck between the rebels and government representatives in Nigeria." In New York crude oil futures closed above 50 dollars a barrel for the first time on Friday, as traders fretted about Nigerian oil production amid a threatened rebel uprising. But markets cooled after the two rebel groups fighting for control of oil resources in the Niger Delta region signed a government-brokered ceasefire and disarmament agreement late on Friday after months of violence. Nigerian military officials on Monday announced a halt to operations in the delta. The leader of the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), Mujahid Dokubo Asari, assured his arch rival, Niger Delta Vigilantes chief Ateke Tom, on Sunday that he was ready to keep the peace. Ateke meanwhile told AFP Monday his group had surrendered its arms to the government. "We have disarmed. There is no more fighting. We are men of peace, " he said in his home town of Okrika. "Asari is my brother. He is Ijaw, I am Ijaw. We are fighting for the same cause. It is just that we misunderstood ourselves," he added. Oil prices had hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in New York and 46.80 dollars in London on Tuesday of last week after the NDPVF threatened war in the delta and urged oil multinationals and foreigners to leave the area. Nigeria is the world's sixth largest exporter of crude oil and Africa's biggest producer, with proved reserves of some 27 billion barrels. Its light, sweet, low-sulphur crude is particularly well suited for refining into petrol, or gasoline. However, market watchers warned that prices could shoot higher again if the tentative truce in the Niger Delta breaks down. And even if oil keeps flowing from Nigeria, the low levels of US crude oil and heating fuel inventories going into the northern hemisphere means that prices are expected to remain high in the coming weeks, they added. "Despite prices coming down this morning, there is still support for (US) crude prices at 50 dollars a barrel and above," said Barclays Capital analyst Kevin Norrish.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two Indonesian women taken hostage by an Islamic militant group in Iraq were released unharmed and handed over to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) embassy here on Monday. Istiqomah binti Misnad and Novitasari binti Sugito, both from East Java province, appeared in shock after their three-day ordeal but were otherwise in good health. "They took us when we were on the road from Amman. They put us in a cell but I don't know near which city it was. I was scared but they did us no harm and treated us well. Then they decided to release us," Sugito told AFP. The two young women were coming to Iraq reportedly to work as maids for two Lebanese nationals contracted by an Iraqi electronics company. The two Lebanese, as well as six Iraqis travelling with them were all kidnapped by the Islamic Army in Iraq, according to a videotaped claim aired by the Arab satellite news channel Al-Jazeera on Saturday. "We were held separately from the others. I don't know what happened to them," said Sugito, before accompanying her friend to a medical check-up. UAE charge d'affaires Ali al-Kaabi told AFP that the two hostages had not complained of any ill-treatment but could not say when the pair were due to leave the country. "They were dropped by a car in front of the embassy at around 12:00 pm (0900 GMT) today. This is how we found out," he said, adding that would be turned over to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The militant group which kidnapped them demanded Jakarta release a radical Indonesian cleric, Abu Bakar Bashir, suspected of links with Al-Qaeda and of involvement in deadly bombings in Bali in 2002. Al-Jazeera said Monday that the group announced in a statement it had freed the hostages at Bashir's request. The channel aired a video from the group purporting to show the two women receiving copies of the Koran, but it was not clear when the footage was recorded.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices slid below the psychologically critical 50 dollar a barrel mark Monday as tensions eased in Nigeria's southern oil heartland, where a rebel group fighting for control of the country's key resource said it had surrendered its weapons. The price of light sweet crude -- which is well suited to refining into petrol and of which Nigeria is one of the main suppliers to the US -- for November delivery fell 32 cents to 49.80 dollars a barrel in early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down from Friday's record close of 50.12. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November slipped 39 cents to 46.23 dollars in late afternoon deals. "The main news is the Nigerian one," said Lee Elliott, a trader with GNI-Man Financial. "There is a small resolution. A deal has been struck between the rebels and government representatives in Nigeria." Threats by a rebel group in Nigeria's oil-rich southern delta region to wage all-out war against the government if their demands for greater autonomy were not met, and deadly clashes between rival gangs in the west African country's oil heartland had sparked concerns about supply from the west African country, which ships some 2.5 million barrels per day of crude. But the two rebel groups fighting for control of oil resources in the Niger Delta region signed a government-brokered ceasefire and disarmament agreement on Friday after months of violence, which Amnesty International has said has claimed at least 500 lives. And on Monday, the leader of one of the armed gangs, Ateke Tom, of the Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV), said his group had surrendered its arms to the government, in a move expected to reverberate on the oil market. "We surrendered all the weapons in our possession to the Rivers State government long before the Abuja peace talks," Tom told AFP in his Okrika home town. "We have disarmed. There is no more fighting. We are men of peace. In fact, we need the peace more than anybody," he said. Ateke Tom said his group had also reached out to arch rival Mujahid Dokubo Asari, leader of the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF). Asari assured Tom Sunday that he was ready to keep the peace. Asari had also threatened to go to war against the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo if his rebel group's demands for a bigger slice of Nigeria's oil wealth, greater autonomy for the Ijaw people, the majority ethnic group in the delta, and a national debate on Nigeria's problems were not met. Nigeria is the world's sixth largest exporter of crude oil and Africa's biggest producer, with proved reserves of some 27 billion barrels. The west African country derives more than 95 percent of its foreign exchange earnings from the sector, but despitlives in one month alone, but the government said only 13 were killed. But despite the cessation of hostilities by the two groups, military sources told AFP Monday of an outbreak of violence at the weekend in the Ijaw village of Ke, near Bille. "A yet to be identified armed gang invaded the village and killed several people. The report was brought to our base but we could not act on it," a senior military officer, who asked not to be named, told AFP from the JTF base in Buguma, west of Port Harcourt. The militia groups denied responsibility for the attack Monday, and police in Port Harcourt were unable to confirm it. Market watchers have warned that prices could shoot higher again if the tentative truce in the Niger Delta breaks down.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Kerry, Bush slug it out over science and taxes by Stephen Collinson (ADDS Kerry campaign reaction on taxes).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[HAMPTON, New Hampshire, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Science and taxes provided a new battlefield Monday for George W. Bush and John Kerry as they prepared to hand the spotlight in their newly tight presidential race to their vice-presidential partners. Kerry accused the president of choosing to "sacrifice science for extreme right wing ideology" in curbing stem-cell research while Bush painted the Massachusetts senator as a serial tax raiser hurting middle-class families. The two men pressed their forays into key swing states in the November 2 election with polls showing Kerry clawing even with the Republican on the strength of a masterful showing in Thursday's televised debate. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll had the two men tied at 49 percent among likely voters, wiping out an eight-point Bush advantage. A Newsweek magazine survey gave Kerry a three-point edge among registered voters. Bush's tepid performance in the debate gave added importance to Tuesday's encounter between Vice President Dick Cheney and his Democratic counterpart, Senator John Edwards, in the midwestern city of Cleveland. Commentators said Cheney would seek to repair the damage from Kerry's relentless attacks on the Iraq war and renew the focus on Bush's leadership after the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes. Edwards was likely to use his skills as a trial lawyer to skewer Cheney as the architect of the administration's security policies that led to windfall reconstruction contracts for his ex-company, Halliburton. The Kriven" restrictions on stem cell research and fund it with at least 100 million dollars a year. Under pressure from religious groups, who see the practice as akin to abortion, Bush moved in August 2001 to bar the use of public funds for research using stem cells from human embryos after that date. But his campaign reacted harshly Monday to suggestions he had instituted an outright ban. "These characterizations are inaccurate or incomplete, and misinform the public on the reality of the policy," a statement said. The president, meanwhile, traveled to the midwestern state of Iowa to sign a new law extending tax relief for married couples, a tax credit for children and an expanded 10 percent tax rate for the lower-paid. His campaign used the occasion to launch another tirade against Kerry, who has condemned the administration's multibillion-dollar tax cuts as designed mainly to benefit the wealthiest Americans and major US corporations. It unveiled a new television advertisement, titled "Thinking Mom," that accuses Kerry and other left-wing members of Congress of voting 350 times for higher taxes, including increased levies on gasoline and Social Security benefits. Women have become a key, coveted constitutency in the race and Iowa is particularly important as a state that went Democratic in the 2000 presidential race but is now tilting slightly towards Bush. The Kerry campaign responded to the Republican comments on gasoline prices by accusing the administration of doing nothing to reduce the country's dependence on Middle East oil, as costs hover near 50 dollars a barrel. "John Kerry will put an end to the Bush energy policy which puts the Saudi royal family before America's working families," spokesman Chad Clanton said in a statement.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANYUWANGI, Indonesia, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The relieved husband of one of two Indonesian women held hostage by militants in Iraq late Monday expressed joy at news of her release. "Alhamdulillah (thank God), I hope she will be sent back home to Indonesia as soon as possible," said Sugianto, husband of Istiqomah binti Misnad, who was reportedly freed along with compatriot Novitasari binti Sugito hours earlier. Abu Dhabi TV aired footage of the two women at the United Arab Emirates embassy in Baghdad after the women were released. The women were kidnapped last week by a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq, which demanded the release of militant Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir held by police in Jakarta on charges of terrorism. Officials in Jakarta and Bashir both rejected the demands and condemned the abductors. Visibly tired after several sleepless nights, Sugianto, mopped his brow on hearing the report of his wife's release, and looked forward to being reunited with her at their ramshackle home in Banyuwangi, in east Java. "When I see her again, I would thank God that she's home," he told AFP, adding that he felt no anger over the kidnapping. "This is our fate. Everyone has destiny, it is part of God's will," he said. Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa said Indonesia's embassy in Abu Dhabi was trying to make contact with the United Arab Emirates embassy in Baghdad where the two were reported to have been handed over. "If the reports about the release of the women are true, surely this is something we hail because it is in accordance with the hopes of millions of Indonesians," he said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Rwandan Catholic priest Athanase Seromba shot at Tutsi refugees who were fleeing into his church during the 1994 genocide in the central African country, a witness told a UN court on Monday. The witness, identified as CBI, told the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) that Seromba stood at the first floor of his residence and shot at people who were trying to enter his residence, Hirondelle news agency reported. The incident occurred in April 1994 at Nyange Parish in Rwanda's western Kibuge province. Seromba, 41, stands accused of directing the massacre of 2,000 of his own parishioners who had sought shelter in his parish church in April 1994. The church was bulldozed with the faithful inside, allegedly on orders of Seromba, whose trial trial began on September 20. The priest has pleaded not guilty to charges of genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity. The witness explained that Seromba could have prevented the attack had he taken necessary measures, but had instead given a local leader a list of those to be eliminated. His lawyers have said they will argue that although he was present at the time of the killings, he was powerless to intervene. The 1994 genocide was orchestrated at the highest levels of Rwanda's then Hutu regime and cost the lives of some 800,000 people, mostly from its Tutsi minority but also moderate Hutus. Courts in Rwanda have convicted several priests -- although two were later cleared after appeal -- and, in 2001, a Belgian court found two Catholic nuns guilty of playing a role in the genocide.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ANTANANARIVO, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Rising world oil prices have given fresh impetus to an as yet fruitless 40-year search for the black gold on and near the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar, officials there said Monday. "Since the rise in the price per barrel, several foreign oil companies have signed exploration licences in Madagascar," Ignace Randrianasolo, head of fossil fuels at the Office of Mines and Strategic Industries, told AFP. "In the past, signs of oil have been found in several places, on land as well as out to sea, but never with a clear indication of the amount available," he added. Madagascar imports all its oil. As well as rising prices, new technology has played a part in the renewed interest in Madagascar, especially on and off the west coast. "We started our explorations in 2001 with a two-dimensional system. The signs are good," Marcelle Dane, the local representative of Vanco Energy, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, told AFP. "Since August, we began looking with a 3-D exploration system, which will last until December," she said. "If all goes well, we will start drilling in 2006," she added without detailing expected reserves. In August this year, a Mauritian company, Vuna Energy Ltd, extended its maritime exploration licence to search on land, between the west coast towns of Morondava and Mahajanga. At the same time, Britain's Sterling Energy reached a similar deal to explore in the waters off the port of Antsiranana, in the north. Norway's Statoil and ExxonMobil are in discussion with the mines office to extend their explorations.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Profiles of Republican Vice President Dick Cheney and Democratic challenger Senator John Edwards who will take part in a debate Tuesday by vice-presidential candidates ahead of the November 2 US election: DICK CHENEY Demonised by Democrats, Dick Cheney is widely seen as the eminence grise of President George W. Bush and is one of the most powerful vice presidents in American political history. Cheney was sent into a White House bunker after the September 11, 2001 attacks and has kept a low profile for much of the Bush administration. He has been one of the hardline defenders of the Iran invasion and mired in controversy over past links to Halliburton, the oil services giant that has huge US military contracts. But when Cheney speaks, the sparks often fly and his comments nearly always make news. Under pressure after months of Democratic criticism over Halliburton, a company he ran until joining the Bush campaign in 2000, Cheney used the F-word in June against Democratic senator Patrick Leahy. He annoyed the Democratic campaign last month by strongly hinting that the United States would face a bigger threat of a new September 11-style attack if voters choose Democrat John Kerry for president on November 2. "Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole. It's a nice way to operate, actually," Cheney said of himself in a rare interview with American newspapers in January. Cheney has, however, also shown an ability to shock even American conservatives, coming out in favour of gay marriages after years of opposition. His eldest daughter is a lesbian. Cheney has decades of experience in Washington power politics. He was the defence secretary during the 1991 Gulf War and a chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, a member of the House of Representatives. Cheney was head of a committee looking for a vice presidential candidate for Bush. The committee decided he would be the best candidate. Despite his fragile health after several heart attacks, disquiet about the Halliburton controversy and Democrat attacks on the way he avoided Vietnam war service, Bush has insisted that Cheney remains his trusted number two. "I admit it, he's not the prettiest face in tha champion of the poor. "We still live in two different Americas -- one for people who have lived the American Dream and don't have to worry, and another for most Americans who work hard and still struggle to make ends meet," he says in speeches that highlight the lost jobs and struggle for health care that many Americans go through. "It doesn't have to be that way," he tells rallies. Some people see Edwards as future presidential candidate material. At the moment age goes against him and he has played the role of a loyal aide to Kerry, sticking to raising the campaign profile in small towns while Kerry takes centre stage in the battle against Bush. Edwards was born June 10, 1953 in South Carolina and raised in neighbouring North Carolina, the state he represents in the US Senate. At 11, he wrote a school essay "Why I Want to Be a Lawyer." His mission: to rise from his modest origins and "protect innocent people from blind justice the best I can." He proved a brilliant attorney, representing parents who lost their children in botched hospital deliveries, and children who lost their parents in car wrecks. Edwards once convinced a jury to award 25 million dollars to a nine-year-old girl who was severely injured in a badly built swimming pool. Success came swiftly in politics. He dispatched an incumbent Republican senator in the 1998 election.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The brother of an Italian-based Iraqi businessman who had been held hostage in Iraq for more than a month said Monday he had learnt from Italy's foreign ministry that he had been murdered. Emad Wali said he had been informed of his brother Ajad Anwar Wali's slaying in a phone call from a foreign ministry official. The Wali brothers have lived in northern Italy for more than 20 years, and the elder Ajad had gone to Iraq to sell Italian-manufactured equipment. He had been held hostage since August 31. Islamic militants in Iraq earlier sent a video to AFP in Baghdad showing Wali, 44, and 33-year-old Turkish national Yalmaz Dabja, being shot dead after "confessing" to the camera that they were spies. The video, whose authenticity was impossible to verify, was dated October 2. The Wali family strongly denied that the businessman, who fled the regime of Saddam Hussein to study and settle in Italy, was a spy. "He wasn't a spy. He collaborated neither with the Italian government nor any foreign government," the family said in a statement from their home in Castelfranco Veneto, near the northern city of Treviso. In the video, one hostage is shown admitting to establishing contacts with Israeli intelligence services "who wanted to buy uranium and (radioactive) red mercury, Turks who asked me to kill (Kurdish leader) Jalal Talabani and Iranians." The second admitted to having been offered "10 million dollars by the Turkish security services and 30 million dollars by the Israelis" to provide them with red mercury. In the tape, five masked men brandishing guns and standing behind the two kneeling hostages identify themselves as "fighters of God" and read out a list of accusations against the pair. It then shows them being shot several times in the back of the head by at least two of the militants.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[OKRIKA, Nigeria, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Ateke Tom, a warlord, who battled another gang for supremacy over Nigeria's oil wealth located in the restive Niger delta Monday preached a new message of peace to his teeming supporters. "Peace is necessary for development. We can only free our people from the shackles of poverty under a peaceful atmosphere," the factional rebel leader said during a rally here. Dressed in a white sports T-shirt and white trousers and accompanied by hordes of aides, Tom was cheered by dozens of jubilant supporters and villagers. Many motorists and motor-cyclists parked their vehicles as a mark of respect for a man they worship as a god. Men and women, young and old, bowed and were prostrate on the ground as Tom made his way through the crowd. As he gave his speech, a group of stern-looking and gun-wielding policemen and soldiers looked on, in apparent approval of the event. There was much drumming, dancing and singing by a cultural group in the town. Some of them had "Ateke wants peace" written on their almost naked bodies. The rally, the first in a series, was organised to mark the end of hostilities between Ateke Tom's group -- Niger Delta Vigilante Service -- and the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force, led by arch rival Mujahid Dokubo Asari. "We will hold a similar peace rally in Port Harcourt and other places. I w "Both of them are our sons. I am sure there was a misunderstanding somewhere. But now that they have agreed to work together, we will support them as a people," Tamunoseipirbie Kiri told AFP. Some 500 people were killed and many more injured in Port Harcourt and its environs in August following fighting between the two armed groups, Amnesty International said in a report. The unrest raised concerns about oil supplies from Nigeria, causing prices to reach an all-time high of 50 dollars last week. Most of the 2.5 million barrels produced daily by Nigeria, fifth largest oil supplier to the United States, comes from the Niger Delta.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JABALIYA, Gaza Strip, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Eight Palestinians, including a child and a teenage girl, were killed by Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip on Monday as Israel's army warned its massive offensive could last for weeks. Since Israel unleashed its military might six days ago, 73 Palestinians have been killed in the deadliest incursion into the Gaza Strip since the start of the intifada, or uprising, four years ago. Israeli chief of staff General Moshe Yaalon warned that the onslaught, aimed at establishing a buffer zone to prevent militants from firing homemade and generally inaccurate rockets at Israel, could last for weeks. "Our forces are ready to operate not just for daered in the homes of the bereaved or in the large mourning tents traditionally erected for the families of the "martyrs". The International Committee of the Red Cross was distributing food and water in the hardest hit neighbourhoods, where power and water supplies had been cut off by the heavy fighting. Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath hit out at the Israeli incursion, calling it "state terrorism" which contravened the internationally-established rules of war. "A crime is being perpetrated against civilians by the Israeli occupation forces, according to the Fourth Geneva Convention," he said while visiting the wounded in Jabaliya's Kamal Udwan hospital. The operation had caused a "humanitarian disaster", he said, calling for an emergency meeting of the convention's signatories to demand that Israel respect its provisions on the treatment of civilians under occupation or in time of war. The Palestinian cabinet has declared a state of emergency in the facy injuring one person, police said. What had started off as a smaller incursion into northern Gaza was massively stepped up on Wednesday after two children were killed in a similar rocket attack on Sderot. Before these deaths, Qassam rockets -- generally inaccurate -- had killed two other people -- a child and a middle-aged man at the end of June. Another three Israelis, two of them soldiers, have been killed in Gaza since the offensive began last Tuesday. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) on Monday slammed Israel for spreading "malicious propaganda" and demanded an immediate apology after the Jewish state claimed UN ambulances were being used by Palestinian militants to transport Qassam rockets. In a strongly-worded letter addressed to Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, UNRWA chief Peter Hansen demanded an "immediate public retraction and apology" from the Israeli government for its accusations.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[CHERBOURG, France, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Anti-nuclear demonstrators stood by on alert at the French Channel port of Cherbourg Monday in readiness for the imminent arrival of a consignment of military-grade plutonium they consider an environmental threat. Two British-registered vessels carrying 140 kilograms (308 pounds) of plutonium from US weapons arsenals were expected to dock here after a voyage from North Carolina. Authorities kept the docking date and hour a strict secret, citing security reasons, and forcing protesters to hold all-night vigils at the port. A boat belonging to the environmentalist group Greenpeace has been on station since Saturday in the Channel off the southern English coast, while on Sunday a dozen sailing boats manned by anti-nuclear activists deployed just beyond the limit of the Cherbourg military zone. The plutonium is to be taken to the French nuclear reprocessing plant at La Hague, then to a facility in southern France to be recycled and eventually returned for civilian use in the United States. Greenpeace has said the long road distances involved in transporting the plutonium caused considerable risk, not least because the cargo's containers could easily be broken open by shoulder-launched rockets. Cogema, the French state nuclear company, issued a statement rejecting the charges, saying the transport of plutonium was carried out with "all safety guarantees," and that the truck convoy would be unmarked to avoid attracting attention. The French nuclear processing company Areva took Greenpeace to court to prevent them demonstrating too close to the plutonium convoy. It was seeking an injunction banning Greenpeace from demonstrating at a distance of less than 100 metres (yards) from the vessels in dock, at less than 300 metres at sea inside French territorial waters, and at less than 100 metres from the overland convoy scheduled to convey the plutonium through France, Greenpeace said. A court hearing here was set for Tuesday. A spokesman for the French anti-nuclear group Sortir du Nucleaire originally said activists calculated the ships would arrive late Monday. But after waiting in vain all night Sunday to Monday, they revised their guesswork, putting back the calculated arrival time to late Tuesday. Three Greenpeace activists in a flotilla protesting the shipment were released from police custody Monday. They included French yachtsman Eugene Riguidel, whose sailboat was impounded by the police. Riguidel's boat was boarded after it touched buoys marking the military zone. The crew -- Riguidel, Jonathan Castle, first captain of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior, and Pernilla Svenberg of Greenpeace International in Amsterdam -- were taken into custody for 24 hours. Protesters have also taken up position along the land route to be followed by the road convoy to the plant at La Hague. Banners proclaimed "Stop plutonium."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[European Union and NATO officials Monday pressed Bosnian Serb authorities to arrest war crimes suspects including former Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic. Pieter Feith, envoy of EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, said after talks with Bosnian Serb President Dragan Cavic that no progress had been made in the hunt for "the worst war criminals" from Bosnia's 1992-95 conflict. "I urged the authorities of Republika Srpska (RS, Bosnian Serb entity) to make additional efforts to bring general Mladic and Mr Karadzic to the (UN war crimes) tribunal so that they can explain themselves," he said. Republika Srpska remains the only territory of former Yugoslavia that has not arrested a single war crimes suspect. There are more than 20 war crimes suspects, mostly Bosnian Serbs, still at large. "The EU regrets that no greater progress has been made in detaining the worst war criminals and in further cooperating with the Hague tribunal," Feith said. His views were echoed by Robert Serry, an envoy of NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Sheffer. He said NATO was "impatiently waiting" for signs that the Bosnian Serb leadership was cooperating with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Cavic insisted that the Serb authorities were "making maximum efforts to show that in the RS there are neither political nor operational obstructions" to the work of the tribunal. He said he would meet tribunal president Theodor Meron and chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte in The Hague on Tuesday. Karadzic and Mladic were charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1995 with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. They are chiefly accused of the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslims in the eastern town of Srebrenica in 1995, as well as the three-and-a-half-year siege of Sarajevo. Post-war Bosnia was split into two semi-independent entities -- the Serbs' Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SOUTHAMPTON, England, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Southampton head coach Steve Wigley has been granted a stay of execution on Monday by the Premier League despite not holding the necessary qualifications. Wigley, who took over from Paul Sturrock in August, does not have the UEFA Pro Diploma which is required by all managers and coaches in the top flight. As a result there was speculation he would be forced to step down in December when his three-month period of leeway expired. But the Premier League announced that Southampton will be given dispensation to allow coach Wigley to stay in the job until August 1, 2005. Wigley holds the UEFA A Licence and, as it was impossible to complete his Pro Diploma in the given time, he has been given special dispensation. "The Board of the FAPL has today granted Southampton Football Club a dispensation from the requirements of Rule Q5 regarding coaching qualifications," said a statement from the Premier League. "Steve Wigley will be allowed to hold the position of head coach or manager until August 1 2005 while he completes the required qualification of a UEFA Pro Diploma. "This decision was taken based on the fact that Mr Wigley already holds a UEFA A Licence, has previously coached the England Under-21 national team and is now undertaking the 2004 UEFA Pro Diploma Course that he will complete by July 2005."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The life expectancy of people in the states of former communist East Germany has risen since reunification and is now comparable to that of their counterparts in the west, a new study said Monday. Despite living in the poorer states of the east, a woman can now expect to live to an average age of just over 81, compared to 76 at the time of German reunification 14 years ago, the Max Planck Institute study found. Men can hope to live an average of almost 75 years compared to just over 69 years in 1990, the demographic study found. Life expectancy has also risen in the west, from an average age of 79 to over 81 for women, and nearly 73 years to about 76 for men. The study's authors put the rise down to developments in medical science and a pension system that offers wider health treatment than before. Unemployment in the eastern states is roughly double that in the west and tens of thousands of people are abandoning the region each year in search of work.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MOJAVE, California, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Ushering in an era of commercial space travel, a private manned rocketship blasted into space on Monday for the second time in five days, winning a 10-million-dollar prize and setting a sub-orbital altitude record. In a flawless mission, SpaceShipOne, piloted by former US navy test pilot Brian Binnie, reached an altitude of 368,000 feet (70 miles/114 kilometers) according to preliminary radar readings. "Today we made history," said Peter Diamandis, president of the Ansari X Prize Foundation, which offered the prize for the first privately-built manned spacecraft to carry out sub-orbital flight twice within two weeks. "Today the winners are the people of Earth," he said as SpaceShipOne was towed towards a cheering crowd of spectators. "Today we go to the stars. "We blew the X-15 away," Diamandis added in a reference to SpaceShipOne breaking the record for sub-orbital flight set by the X-15 rocket plane more than 40 years ago. The X-15, jointly developed by NASA and the US military, set an altitude record of 354,200 feet (67 miles/108 kilometers) on its August 22, 1963 flight. As SpaceShipOne touched down here Monday, its designer, aviation pioneer Burt Rutan, stood alongside British tycoon Richard Branson and Diamandis on the tarmac of Mojave airport leaping for joy and cheering the historic feat. Branson, owner of Virgin Airways, last week announced plans to join the private space race using a craft based on SpaceShipOne. He described Monday's flight as a "magnificent achievement" and said he was looking forward to receiving the first five spacecraft for his "Virgin Galactic" spaceline by 2007. To win the X Prize, the same reusable manned spacecraft needed to make two journeys into space within two weeks while carrying the equivalent weight of two passengers. Rutan was jubiliant over the success of the flight and smashing the record of the X-15. "We did indeed go after breaking the X-15 record set in 1963 and we beat it by a full 13,000 feet (2.5 miles/4.0 kilometers)," he said. Rutan, long an outspoken adversary of the major US aerospace companies and NASA, cocked a victorious snoot at his rivals, deriding what he called the "Boeings, the Lockheeds, the naysayers in Houston." "If they got a look at how this flight was run and how we developed the capabilities of this ship and its safety I think they would look at each other right now and say 'I'm screwed,'" he said. SpaceshipOne was only the start of his quest for out-of-this-world travel, he said, and vowed to develop space tourism craft for Branson that would be "at least 100 times safer than anything that is ever flown into space." Binnie, the 51-year-old pilot, described the flight as a "a dream come true." "I'm riding on the coattails of some giants here," he said referring to Rutan and the world'ace between Moscow and Washington. Organisers who proposed the competition hope it will spawn an age of space travel rivalling the dawn of commercial air transport in the late 1920s. The X Prize, funded by private donors, was established in 1996 and modelled on the 25,000-dollar Orteig prize that aviator Charles Lindbergh won when he became the first solo pilot to cross the Atlantic in 1927. His feat gave birth to airlines and allowed ordinary people to fly.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[AMMAN, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The son and the brother of a Jordanian abducted in Iraq appealed Monday to his kidnappers to release him, stressing he was a family man who went to Baghdad to make a living and had no connection with US forces. "My brother Hisham Taleb al-Ezza went to Iraq to earn his bread and butter. He has no ties, by near or far, with the Americans," the hostage's brother Mohamad al-Ezza told AFP. "On behalf of the Al-Ezza tribes in Jordan, Palestine and Iraq, and on behalf of Hisham's children, we exhort the brothers in Iraq to free Hisham as soon as possible," he said. The hostage's 22-year-old son, Munzer, echoed him and urged the Jordanian authorities to help win his father's release. "Please find a solution. There is nothing I can do," he said. Hisham Taleb al-Ezza, who also has five daughters, works as an accountant for an Iraqi transport firm, Starlite, which has its regional office in the Jordanian capital. His family said he moved to Iraq four months ago. On Saturday night a militant group in Iraq said it kidnapped Hisham and threatened to kill him within 72 hours unless Starlite ceased its operations in Iraq, in a videotape broadcast by the Al-Arabiya satellite television channel. Hisham's employer, regional director Mohammed Sameh al-Ajluni, immediately announced he was halting operations in Iraq and stressed that his firm's Iraq operations dated back to 1996, well before last year's US-led invasion. On Monday, Ajluni told AFP that the kidnappers were demanding a ransom of half a million dollars, even after he had met their demands to shut down operations in Iraq. "We hope they will hear our appeal and release him because we have done what they demanded," Ajluni said. Obeid went on Al Arabiya television to inform the kidnappers that his firm was "fully prepared to negotiate immediately with you to facilitate" the release of Ezza. He also thanked the kidnappers for allowing the hostage to "call his family to reassure them on his health".]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Manchester United, the world's richest football club, said Monday it had received a preliminary takeover approach, following reports that American sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer was plotting to seize control. The multi-millionaire, who holds a 19.2-percent stake in the club, is poised to launch a takeover bid for the English giants worth at least 650 million pounds (943 million euros, 1.17 billion dollars), newspapers here said. The 126-year-old club, home to such star players as wonderboy Wayne Rooney and Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, is a commercial powerhouse, enjoying huge sponsorship deals with Nike and Vodafone. It earns millions of pounds per year from merchandise, putting its name to financial products -- even mortgages -- as well as from its matches being beamed to televisions around the globe. The board of the club said in a statement that it "confirms that it has received a preliminary approach regarding a possible offer for the company." It added: "This approach contains a number of significant conditions. The company is seeking clarification of this proposal and at this stage it is unclear whether any offer will be made." In London, the price of shares in Manchester United surged 5.34 percent to close at 271 pence, valuing the almost debt-free club at over 700 million pounds. There was no immediate response from Glazer, owner of NFL franchise Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the second-largest shareholder in United, whose fans number in millions from Manchester to Macau. An analyst at itish takeover rules. Britain's Daily Star on Sunday newspaper meanwhile quoted top banker Mehmet Dalman, who has helped Glazer snap up his existing United shares, as saying that "the Glazer family -- Malcolm and his sons Joel, Ed and Bryan -- are interested in having a major involvement in United. "The Glazers want to own the club -- either through buying more shares or through management or board level." Manchester United fans voiced anger at the prospect of Glazer winning control. "Supporters feel very strongly that they do not want Malcolm Glazer to take over," said Mark Longden, of the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association. "He does not have the money to buy the club and would have to borrow heavily. The fans do not want the club to go into debt. It is a very risky business."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Spanish and French governments on Monday hailed a "historic" victory against armed Basque separatist group ETA following the weekend arrest in France of ETA's political leader and 16 associates. "This is a major step towards ending the violence of the terrorist group ETA. ETA's destiny can only be its demise," Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told reporters. Zapatero and French President Jacques Chirac lauded the joint efforts of both countries' police forces in dealing ETA its heaviest blow in more than a decade. In a telephone call to Chirac, Zapatero passed on "the thanks of the Spanish government and the people" to France for tracking the ETA members down. Chirac replied that "ay. The sources added that Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon would seek to question "Antza" in France, having four years ago opened an investigation into the same suspect for "belonging to an armed group." On Sunday, the French interior ministry said arms caches were discovered in seven locations after around 140 specialist officers, including members of France's anti-terrorist brigade and intelligence services, raided several properties. Alonso said the French raids turned up 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of dynamite and 300 kilograms of potassium chlorate. The swoop on the suspected Basque militants was the biggest setback ETA has suffered since 1992 when a raid in the village of Bidart in the same area of southwest France netted the entire leadership of the organisation. ETA, which has been fighting for an independent Basque homeland since 1959, has killed 817 people in the process, according to a count released Monday by El Pais daily. But 12 low-level attacks tturday they had arrested last week on the Spanish side of the border. The Basque country straddles the two countries, comprising a large region of northern Spain and part of southwest France.]]></c>

He takes over from Antoine Kombouare who was sacked following Saturday's 0-2 home loss to Nantes, which leaves the club stuck to the bottom of the league with just four points and not a single win from nine games this season. "After a sad weekend regarding the team who were not worthy of being on the pitch we wanted to give new hope to the club," said president Egon Gindorf. Dugueperoux, 56, previously coached the club in 1995 and 1998, and is currently in charge of recruitment. Kombouare, 40, took over from Ivan Hasek in May 2003 and his contract had been extended for two years until 2007.

		<d><![CDATA[PRISTINA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[German Defense Minister Peter Struck arrived in Kosovo on Monday to meet German troops taking part in NATO peacekeeping, amid criticism of their failure to stop bloody ethnic riots in March. Struck attended a maneuver performed by the German troops based in the southern town of Prizren as part of the NATO-led international force (KFOR) that has patrolled the ethnic-Albanian dominated Serbian province since the end of the 1998-99 war. "(The) Bundeswehr has been again faced with an instable environment," Struck told the soldiers. Some 3,300 German soldiers serve with 18,000-strong KFOR troops. Dozens of Serb homes and seven churches were razed by mobs of ethnic Albanian extremists in Prizren in March, when violence killed 19 people and drove thousands of Serbs from their homes across the troubled province. The Kosovo daily Koha Ditore quoted Struck as saying the March riots, described as an organised campaign of "ethnic cleansing" by some NATO commanders, meant peacekeepers would have to stay in the province longer than expected. An internal German defense ministry report which was leaked to the press last month said German peacekeepers were woefully unprepared for the anti-Serb violence. The report found that units had no crisis plan, were poorly trained, were not proficient in English and had insufficient protective equipment. Struck has faced opposition calls for a formal parliamentary probe into the German troops' apparent failure to recognize the extent of the clashes. Although he admitted German troops had mistaken the mounting tensions between Serbs and Albanians as "routine", Struck has denied that grave mistakes had been made. Struck also defended his soldiers faced with criticism from the UN mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), who had accused the troops of failing to protect its policemen during the riots, "despite demands for permanent aid," as one German police organization had claimed in May. KFOR's mission was not to protect the policemen, Struck said. However, Struck insisted that the soldiers should "not be used" to remain "forever" in the province, without a political accord over the future of this southern Serbian province under the UN administration since 1999 NATO bombing campaign. During his one-day visit to the province, Struck met with UN Kosovo administrator Soren Jessen Petersen.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[HAMPTON, New Hampshire, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democratic nominee John Kerry Monday accused President George W. Bush of sacrificing life-saving science for right-wing dogma as he joined ailing Hollywood star Michael J. Fox to skewer Republican curbs on stem cell research. Kerry, riding high after several opinion polls suggested he had erased Bush's opinion poll lead ahead of their second head-to-head debate on Friday, held a rally in a school in New Hampshire. "The hard truth is that when it comes to stem-cell research, this president has made the wrong choice, to sacrifice science for extreme right-wing ideology and that is unacceptable," said Kerry, as he accused the administration of drastically stem cell research. Supporters say research on embryonic stem cells could lead to a cure for patients living with diseases like Alzheimers, diabetes, and terminal leukaemia and some types of cancer. "Back to the Future Star" Fox, now stricken with Parkinson's disease, said Bush's Republicans had severely limited the number of stem-cell lines available for research for purely ideologial reasons. "George W. Bush has made the wrong decision on stem cell research, we are very excited that John Kerry will get us back on track," said the Canadian-born star, shaking perceptibc stem cells that had already been destroyed. Opponents argue that tens of thousands of frozen stem cells in existence could be used to find a cure to deadly diseases. Kerry is trying to paint Bush's refusal to admit problems with a rising insurgency in Iraq as part of a pattern of oblivion or indifference to what Democrats say are disastrous domestic policies. "President Bush just doesn't get it. Faced with the facts, he just turns away. Time and again he's proven that he's stubborn, out of touch and unwilling to change course," Kerry said here. The veteran Massachusetts senator was due to head on to Philadelphia and then to a late night rally in Iowa, the state that rescued his ailing campaign earlier this year, by giving him a shock win in the Democratic caucus, which eventually propelled him to win the nomination.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[DES MOINES, Iowa, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush on Monday signed into law a 146-billion-dollar tax cut bill in this up-for-grabs state, one month before the hotly-contested election that pits him against Democrat John Kerry. Speaking to a crowd of cheering supporters four days before the second presidential debate, the president renewed his call for making permanent the 10-year, trillion-dollar tax cuts at the heart of his economic agenda. "The tax relief comes at just the right time for America," said Bush, whose visit to the battleground state of Iowa guaranteed him local headlines and evening newscasts. "We need to make all the tax relief permanent." Bush, who stands to become the first US president since the Great Depression to oversee a net job loss, promised that the tax reduction "will have good effects throughout the economy." Although some economists have called the legislation a budget buster, it enjoyed the election-year support of Bush, Kerry, and an overwhelming majority of lawmakers in the US Senate and House of Representatives. It marked the fourth major tax cut enacted by Congress at the urging of Bush, estimated to be worth 146 billion dollars over 10 years. Analysts said the bill may give Bush a political victory going into the November 2 election, but Kerry also endorsed the measure as offering middle class relief. "Millions of American families are being squeezed by the weak Bush economy, falling incomes and rising health costs, and we should extend middle class tax breaks to help them," Kerry said just ahead of the final votes. "That is why I support middle class tax cuts, including the tax package now being considered in Congress." But some analysts said the measure puts the federal budget in an even more precarious situation, at a time when a record 422-billion-dollar deficit is predicted.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The fashion world's rising stars took the spotlight in Paris on Monday, unveiling their latest collections for spring-summer 2005 to kick off ready-to-wear week in the French capital. Ahead of Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto's evening show, the first powerhouse presentation of the week, the European Union ruled the catwalk with talents from Austria, Belgium, France and Germany showing their stuff. France's Gaspard Yurkievich likes glitz, sparkle and rock and roll. His models, clad in slinky silver lame and fluorescent lace, strutted across the dance floor in the historic Salle Wagram to the thumping beat of a live band. The Paris-based designer gave his glittering mini-dresses a dash of sex appeal with midriff cut-outs but also a bit of ladylike flair by twisting waistlines into large bows. An oversized black hooded sweatshirt revealed Yurkievich's love of streetwear, but the feather details added a girlish touch. A charcoal gray pinstriped pencil skirt stood out as one of the rare pieces fit for the office. Belgium's Bruno Pieters drew inspiration from Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni's "Zabriskie Point", a bleak yet poetic look at 1960s America, to create a serene collection in the pale hues of the film's Death Valley setting. A fitted white jacket open nearly to the navel topped baggy tan shorts rolled at the hemline. Pieters recalled the muted blue-green desert sky with a simple tank top and draped knee-length skirt combination. A sweet pink candy-striped baby doll dress recalled the innocence of the 1960s, while black pleated leather cheerleader skirts and jackets sketched a more dangerous silhouette. Perhaps the only misstep by the 27-year-old Pieters, who studied at the prestigious Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, was a long sleeveless dress with a heavy open-knit cream overlay -- hardly appropriate for a desert summer. Tim van Steenbergen, just 26 and also a graduate of the Antwerp school, conjured up a carefree, feminine collection of simple sundresses, charming sweaters and full-cut shorts in pale pink, lilac, white, black and navy. The Belgian designer used tiers of pleats to spice up long pearl gray skirts, and huge fabric blossoms to draw the eye up to the face. Low-key flat leather sandals completed the look. Desiree Heiss and Ines Kaag, the Austrian-German dup behind the Bless label, mastered the staging of their show, projecting images of a bustling Paris boulevard onto several screens and incorporating the models into the scene. But the spare lighting and eye-catching backdrop, which included a live guitarist, made it rather difficult to see the casual clothes, although a gray tee-shirt twisted and cut away to reveal a black bra was hard to miss. Yamamoto and fellow Japanese designer Jun Takahashi were to unveil their collections l Edu could leave on a free next summer and if a deal is not negotiated before the January transfer window Arsenal could opt to cash in on the Brazilian.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LUSAKA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa Monday said he had sacked his deputy, Vice President Nevers Mumba, for accusing the Democratic Republic of Congo of meddling in Lusaka's internal affairs. "I have decided to relieve Mr Mumba of his duties as vice president with immediate effect," Mwanawasa told a hastily convened press conference in the capital. "He has been misunderstanding his line of duty," said Mwanawasa, who on Saturday apologised to the DRC government for "embarrassing and careless" accusations made by Mumba. DRC envoy to Zambia, Jean-Marie Kazadi, said Wednesday he was "fed up" with claims from Lusaka that his country was helping opposition parties who were trying to foment unrest. Mwanawasa said earlier he met DRC leader Joseph Kabila in New York recently where the two leaders agreed to work together in building strong relations between the neighbouring countries. Mumba is to be replaced by Lupando Mwape, a former transport and communications minister in the government of Mwanawasa's predecessor, Frederick Chiluba. Mwape served in the same capacity until Mwanawasa sacked him late last year, only to be reinstated as a deputy provincial minister in June. For his part Mumba later told journalists that the media had misrepresented his statements on DRC. "I said individuals were using DRC and not the government," he said. Mumba was quoted last month as saying that the DRC was being used to channel illicit funds to some opposition parties who were fomenting unrest.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PRAGUE, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Prague city chiefs on Monday reversed a decision to have a war memorial built by controversial internationally-acclaimed artist David Cerny over anti-communist comments he made. Cerny won a contest to design the memorial to World War Two resistance fighters, which will be erected close to the Vltava river in the city's Mala Strana district on the second anniversary of the end of the second world war next May. But the council for the Prague city center district overturned its earlier decision after Cerny recently said in response to a journalist's question "A good communist is a dead communist". Cerny had been asked if he did not mind that many communists were among those being commemorated by his sculpture. "Fifteen years after the Velvet Revolution where we thought that we had believed that we had thrown off the communist scoundrels, communists still have a big say in our society," Cerny said Monday. "I don't understand how a newspaper article could change the results of a competition," he added. Cerny's sculpture was to be metallic, formed by two corridors representing flags, and full of holes, which have the form of face silhouettes. The 150,000 holes corresponded to the estimated number of victims of the resistance during World War Two. The Czech Union of Freedom Fighters had objected that the number of holes did not accurately represent the number of victims, a figure which is still disputed. The association say that the total number of Czech victims of Nazism is 360,000. The council will now enter discussions with second-placed artist Vladimir Vihan. Many of 37-year-old Cerny's previous projects have proved controversial. They include the pink tank, the large babies crawling up a television transmitter tower and the walking Trabant commemorating east Germans who fled for the west in 1989. Cerny's latest project is a fountain featuring two men urinating text messages.]]></c>

"Caiga Quien Caiga", which satires political figures as well as celebrities, won five Emmy nominations, the most ever for a single show, with programmes from Chile and Mexico also figuring prominently in the running for the November 22 awards in New York. Nominations for the awards, which exclude US productions, were announced on the opening day of the MIPCOM television trade fair taking place in this French Riviera city. Of the 28 nominees in seven categories, South Africa received its second nomination in the history of the awards, and for the first time, a non-United Kingdom broadcaster, Danish Broadcasting Corporation, received three nominations in a row, in a category. Channel 4, Granada and the BBC each received multiple nominations. No US programmes compete for the International Emmy Awards as they vie for the original Emmy Awards.

		<c><![CDATA[Tottenham midfielder Jamie Redknapp is facing a three-match ban after being charged with serious foul play by the Football Association (FA) on Monday following his horror tackle on Everton midfielder Tim Cahill. Redknapp was cautioned by referee Graham Poll, who has subsequently reviewed the incident and submitted his report to the FA in the light of the incident which came in Spurs' 1-0 win at Goodison Park. Redknapp, who has apologised to the Australian international, has 14 days to respond to the charge. The FA could also come under pressure to apply the same criteria to Redknapp's Spurs' team-mate, the England striker Jermain Defoe, who committed just as bad a foul on David Weir in the same match on Saturday. Both players were only booked for their fouls - Redknapp for the fifth time this season which brings an automatic one-match suspension. That caution would usually be sufficient for the FA to deem that Poll had dealt with the issues, leaving further action unnecessary.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BEIRUT, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Druze leader Walid Jumblatt on Monday rejected any role in the Lebanese government, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri's efforts to form a national unity cabinet. "The Democratic Gathering has taken the decision not to participate in any government," Jumblatt told reporters after a meeting of the group which has called for an end to Syrian political and security interference in Lebanon. "Even thinking about the participation would be political suicide," said Jumblatt, who met with Hariri late Sunday over possible participation in the next cabinet. Jumblatt said the gathering could not take part in the government after it had refused to vote in favour of a constitutional amendment for the extension of the term of pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud. Four Lebanese ministers, including the three members representing the gathering led by Jumblatt, quit on September 6 in protest at the constitutional amendment which kept Lahoud as head of state for another three years. On Friday, one of the Democratic Gathering's members was the target of a failed assassination attempt. Hariri held talks in Damascus and with the Lebanese Christian opposition earlier Monday as part of consultations to form a new government of national unity, amid international concern over Syria's power-broker role in Lebanon.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri held talks in Damascus and with the Lebanese opposition on Monday as part of efforts to form a national unity cabinet, amid international concern over Syrian domination of Lebanon. But Druze leader Walid Jumblatt rejected participation in the cabinet proposed by Hariri, a political ally. Lebanon has been in political crisis since parliament adopted a Syrian-backed constitutional amendment on September 2 to extend the term of pro-Damascus President Emile Lahoud, a political foe of the premier. A UN Security Council resolution, passed on September 2 and sponsored by Washington and Paris, demanded a Syrian troop pullout as well as an end to Damascus's domination of Lebanon, exacerbating the situation. Syria carried out a limited withdrawal from its small neighbour but has kept some 15,000 troops in the country that both Damascus and Beirut say are deployed at Lebanon's request for the security of the country. Four Lebanese ministers, including three close aides of Jumblatt, qgrouping, Qornet Shehwan, which seeks an end to Syria's military presence in Lebanon, for consultations over possible participation in the next cabinet. A member of the Christian opposition who asked not to be named told AFP the gathering did not plan to respond to Hariri's proposal before knowing whether their own "platform would be taken into account". The Christian opposition has demanded that the government draft a new electoral law ahead of legislative polls due in 2005 and called for more balanced relations with Syria. Earlier, Hariri's deputy said the prime minister was likely to head the next government and that the current cabinet would stay on in a caretaker capacity for the time being. "The cabinet will be in a position to resign once the details of the new government, which will probably be entrusted to Hariri, are known," Deputy Prime Minister Issam Fares told reporters. In the meantime he said it was important for ministers to remain at their posts to "handle immediate business". "Hariri is aware that the current phase is crucial and he is making contacts with all parties" about the makeup of the new government, said Fares. "Based on these consultations, measures will be adopted." In Syria on Monday, President Bashar al-Assad sacked eight cabinet members, including the holder of the key post of interior minister that went to the head of Syria's political security service, Major General Ghazi Kanaan. The appointment of Kanaan, long-time director of Syrian military intelligence in Lebanon, was seen by diplomats in Damascus as a sign Syria was preparing to return to a more pragmatic policy towards its smaller neighbour.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The European Commission on Monday fine-tuned a crunch report on Turkey's bid to join the EU which is expected to give a green light but warn that the predominantly Muslim country might have to wait more than a decade to fulfil its long-held dream. Top officials from the EU executive met to finalize the core recommendations of the document to be unveiled on Wednesday on whether the European Union should agree to start membership negotiations with Turkey. After the meeting, an EU source said the report will state that Turkey fulfils the political criteria to start talks but will warn that these could be suspended "if the Commission believes that the conduct of reforms in Turkey is compromised." German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder meanwhile said that the EU will probably decide unanimously in December to open negotiations with Turkey. If the Commission report says that Turkey meets European criteria, the heads of state and government of the 25 EU members will have to decide at a mid-December summit whether to open negotiations with the country. If they give the go-ahead the negotiations are set to begin "without delay." Turkey has been waiting to join the European club since 1963 but its efforts have hitherto stumbled over its civil rights record. Opponents of Turkish membership have long argued that Turkey is simply too big and too different to fit into the EU. But Turkey now appears to be set for good news, according to widely leaked elements of the Commission report and statements from various commissioners. These praise Ankara's reforms but warn that it will probably be well into the next decade before the country of 71 million inhabitants can expect to become a member of the mainly Christian EU. Turkey itself is under no illusions about how soon it can join, with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying Sunday that membership talks could last until 2019. The French daily Le Figaro reported Monday that according to a leaked copy of the report it had seen, the Commission is set to underline that starting talks does not necessarily mean they will eventually conclude successfully. It said the report called for Turkey's application to be subject to much stricter controls than that of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the EU earlier this year. Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul later Monday rejected any suggestion of "special conditions" for Turkey. "That is out of the question," he said. A spokesman for EU enlargement commissioner Guenter Verheugen, whose office is preparing the report, refused Monday to comment on the plethora of leaks, saying only that "we will see on Wednesday." But Olli Rehn, who takes over from Verheugen next month, said Monday that the European Commission will indeed recommend that the EU should start entry talks with Turkey while stressing the need for mechanisms to monitor reforms. Verheugen himself said last month that "no obstacles remain on the table" after resolving a week-long conflict last month about Turkish plans -- later abandoned -- to criminalize adultery. The next head of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, meanwhile said he welcomed the idea of referenda in EU member countries on the issue of Turkey's possible future accession. "It is a mistake to assume that a decision of this importance can be taken against the will of Europeans," said Barroso.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NOUAKCHOTT, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A fourth swarms of locusts in two months swooped into the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott on Monday, disrupting traffic and causing bad visibility. The new invasion of the finger-length insects coincides with the appearance of locust larvae on the outskirts of the capital, according to experts at the agriculture ministry's anti-locust task force. The capital remained under threat of another locust invasion because "huge numbers of locust larvae are surrounding areas not far from the limits of Nouakchott," one expert said. Mauritania has been the West African country worst-hit by a series of locust plagues. Around 1.6 million hectares have been laid fallow by the golden clouds of insects, which are able to travel up to 200 kilometers (125 miles) in a single day, consuming as much food as 2,500 people. A series of good rains, first in the Sahel last summer and then in northwest Africa during winter and spring have created favorable conditions for locust development, allowing at least four generations of locusts to breed in quick succession.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Twenty-two schoolgirls were injured in a stampede on Monday as they rushed to leave their school in the holy city of Mecca after a fire broke out, a civil defense official said. "Twenty-two girls were lightly wounded when pupils rushed to leave the school to escape from the fire," the official told AFP from Mecca, requesting anonymity. He said the fire broke out at the Um Salamah school, a philanthropic establishment with many African pupils. "Initial investigations suggest that the fire resulted from a short circuit. Most of the wounded are Saudis or of African nationalities," the official added. "The injuries occurred as girls rushed to the main gate of the school in panic," he said, adding that the injuries were minor, and none of the girls suffered burns. In March 2002, King Fahd sacked the head of girls' education in Saudi Arabia after 15 teenage girls burned to death and more than 50 were injured in a fire at their school, also in Mecca in the west of the kingdom. The high casualty toll was attributed to a lack of safety precautions, but there were also widespread reports at the time that rescue workers and volunteers were blocked by the country's zealous religious police. Newspapers said then that the religious police of the conservative Muslim country had prevented men from trying to rescue the girls for fear of "exposing females to male strangers."]]></c>

"Michael will meet up with the rest of the squad on Tuesday and our medical staff, who are already aware of the situation, will assess him then.

		<t><![CDATA[Vice presidential debate takes on new importance by Peter Mackler.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Vice President Dick Cheney will square off with his Democratic rival John Edwards in a televised debate Tuesday that suddenly takes on importance for the Republicans after George W. Bush's tepid showing last week. Political analysts agree that vice presidential debates, which go back to 1976, usually have little impact on the race for the White House since voters cast their ballots strictly for the man at the top. But the stakes will be higher in Tuesday's encounter in the midwestern city of Cleveland, coming five days after Bush suffered a clear defeat at the hands of Senator John Kerry in the first of their three debates. Commentators said Cheney would seek to repair the damage from the Democrat's relentless attacks on the Iraq war and renew the focus on Bush's leadership after the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes. The 63-year-old political veteran was also likely to highlight his knowledge and experience, and portray Edwards, a freshman senator from North Carolina, as part of a Democratic team unfit to command the war on terror. Edwards was expected to use his trial lawyer skills to skewer Cheney as the architect of the administration's failed security policies that produced chaos in Iraq but led to windfall reconstruction contracts for his ex-company, Halliburton. The 51-year-old Democrat, with unabashed presidential ambitions of his own, also geared for an assault on the Republicans' economic record, which the Kerry campaign plans to hit hard in the final weeks before the November 2 election. Both sides will be hoping to snatch the momentum ahead of the next Bush-Kerry debates scheduled to be held Friday on the midwestern city of St. Louis, Missouri, and October 13 in the western city of Tempe, Arizona. The first showdown last Thursday had a dramatic effect, with polls showing Kerry's crisp performance helping him erase a five to eight-point Bush advantage and claw his way back into a virtual dead heat. The Democrat cut deeply into the president's hefty edge on the issues of terrorism and the Iraq war while recapturing a solid lead on the economy over Bush, who appeared hesitant and irritated at times. The Republicans vowed the president would do better in the next face-off but are looking to Cheney for damage control when he takes on Edwards in the 90-minute debate at Case Western Reserve University, analysts said. Vice presidental debates have traditionally been written off as side shows to the campaign. Retired Vice Admiral James Stockdale, the independent candidate in 1992, famously asked in his opening statement: "Who am I. Why am I here." But one of the few debates to make a difference might have been Cheney's 2000 meeting with Senator Joseph Lieberman, where he was able to reassure voters of the Republican ticket's depth and gravitas. "There is some evidence that it increased perlysts said. Cheney will be seeking to damp down speculation that he had become a liability to the Republican ticket, while Edwards will be out to burnish his image as a potential White House contender in 2008 if the Democrats lose in November.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[European stock markets chalked up solid gains Monday in brisk trading underpinned by a firm opening on Wall Street and lower oil prices. London's FTSE 100 index rose 0.48 percent to finish at 4,681.8 points, Frankfurt's DAX added 0.96 percent to 4,033.28, while in Paris the CAC 40 index gained 0.99 percent to 3,767.06. The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading eurozone shares advanced 0.98 percent to 2,823.61 points. The euro stood at 1.2275 dollars. Investors in European shares were encouraged by a positive opening on Wall Street where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.12 percent to 10,204.52 points while the tech-laden Nasdaq composite climbed 0.71 percent to 1,955.92. A fall in global oil prices also relieved recent concerns about the cost of crude eating into corporate margins. However, despite the rally, which started last week, investors were cautious about the immediate outlook in light of upcoming US economic data, European interest rates decisions and forthcoming company results. "This is the week it all happens," Nomura analyst Anais Faraj said. "Apart from the September non-farm payrolls (employment data in the United States) and European interest rate decisions, we have the start of the US third-quarter earnings season." He added: "If last week's market performance is anything to go by, the next few weeks could see some decent upside for global equities." Thursday sees the European Central Bank and Bank of England give their latest monthly interest rate verdicts, although both are widely expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged. In London, the price of shares in Manchester United surged 5.34 percent to close at 271 pence after the world's richest club said it had received a preliminary takeover approach, following reports that American sports tycoon Malcolm Glazer was plotting to seize control. Weekend press reports suggested that multi-millionaire Glazer, who holds a 19.2-percent stake in the club, was poised to launch a takeover bid for the English giants, worth at least 650 million pounds (943 million euros, 1.17 billion dollars). In Paris, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company closed 4.09 percent higher at 22.90 euros, supported by investor hopes for new contracts in China to be announced during French President Jacques Chirac's upcoming visit to Asian countries. "There are hopes that Chirac will announce new orders for Airbus during his visit in China which will continue to benefit the company's revenue growth," said Frederic Boissel of Global Equities. Elsewhere in Europe, Madrid's Ibex-35 gained 1.05 percent to 8,306.8 points, Amsterdam's AEX rose 1.31 percent to 335.19, Brussels' Bel-20 added 1.28 percent to 28,622 and the SMI index of Swiss shares advanced 1.30 percent to 5,600.9. In Asia, Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei-225 index closed 2.68 percent higher at 11,279.63 points and Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index added 1.82 percent to 13,359.25.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[COPENHAGEN, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Danish Institute for Human Rights on Monday harshly criticized Denmark's restrictive family reunification policy for immigrants, claiming that it violated the European Convention on Human Rights. In a publicly funded report, the institute lambasted Copenhagen for its 24-year age requirement for marriage between a Dane and a foreigner, claiming that the age-limit breached article 8 of the Convention on the right to family life. The report also criticized a law requiring any couple requesting family reunification rights to prove that both the husband and wife have close ties to Denmark, or that one of them has been a Danish citizen for at least 28 years. This rules "result in differential treatment. between Danish citizens of Danish ethnicity and Danish citizens of non-Danish ethnicity (and) between individuals born as Danish citizens and persons born and grown up in Denmark as non-Danish citizens", the institute stated. The requirement for all foreigners to make a security deposit of 53,096 kroner (8,756 dollars, 7,134 euros) before being reunited with their spouse in Denmark was also chastised in the report. The criticism echoed concerns voiced by European Council Human Rights Commissary Alvaro Gil Robles following a visit to Denmark last April, when he recommended that the Center-Right government their loosen its family reunification restrictions. Copenhagen has on several occasions rejected the criticism, and on September 23 this year published a report claiming that Denmark "respects international conventions". On January 1, 2004, the Scandinavian country counted 263,541 immigrants without Danish passports, making up 4.9 percent of its population of 5.4 million inhabitants. Counting those that have become Danish citizens, immigrants make up eight percent of Denmark's population.]]></c>

The 18 metre (60 feet)-long wooden vessel with an estimated 150 people on board was spotted in international waters some 50 nautical miles south of the Italian island, where more than 1,000 illegal immigrants have landed in the past week. The warship "Cigala Fulgusi" stood by for several hours until a Tunisian navy vessel arrived to escort the boat back to North Africa at the request of Italy's interior ministry, the agency said. There was no report of the migrants' vessel experiencing any difficulties. Forty-two people were feared drowned earlier Monday after another boat bound for Italy broke up after it left a Tunisian beach, authorities said. Rome has adopted a get-tough policy on illegal immigration to counteract a fresh wave of sea-borne clandestine immigration, expelling more than 1,000 migrants to Libya aboard 11 flights since Friday.

		<t><![CDATA['Psycho' star Janet Leigh dies at 77 (ADDS quotes, details).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Actress Janet Leigh, who attained screen immortality as the murder victim in a famous shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's bloody classic "Psycho," has died at the age of 77, a family spokesman said Monday. "She died peacefully, surrounded by her family," including her husband Robert Brandt and actress-daughters Jamie Lee and Kelly Curtis, said Heidi Schaeffer, a spokeswoman for Jamie Lee Curtis. Leigh, a life-long Californian, died at her Beverly Hills home Sunday of vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, an ailment she had battled for the past year. She was a major screen star in the 1950s and 1960s. Her role in "Psycho" in 1960 became the best known in a varied career that spanned 63 films. The 45 second killing was voted best screen death earlier this year by Total Film magazine. Leigh played played office worker Marion Crane who was stabbed by the deranged motel owner Norman Bates. She earned an Oscar nomination as best supporting actress and a place in cinema history. "Nearly 45 years on Psycho's shower scene is still distressing," said Simon Crook, the Total Film's assistant editor. Leigh had also repeatedly expressed admiration for Hitchcock's brilliance. "I thought it was cleverly done," Leigh said in a recent interview. "We weren't allowed to show nudity or a knife entering a body but most people believe they saw it. They did in their imaginations. Having restrictions like that, I think, was good because it forced filmmakers to be more creative," Leigh said. Leigh, born Jeanette Helen Morrison, was discovered by a Hollywood legend of the 1930s, actress Norma Shearer, who spotted Leigh's picture at the front desk of a California resort where the girl's father worked as clerk and her mother as a maid. Leigh starred in her first movie, "The Romance of Rosy Ridge", in 1947 and soon became feted for her classic beauty and hour-glass figure. She remained one of Hollywood's most sought-after actresses for more than a decade, averaging about four films a year. Among her personal favorites was the 1949 classic "That Forsythe Woman," set in the Victorian era, and "Little Women" filmed in the same year, in which she played Meg March. "They were such beautiful pictures," Leigh said in a newspaper interview this year. "They were just pretty to look at and wonderful escapism. Somehow the studios weren't afraid to make beautiful pictures then." She played Princess Aleta in "Prince Valiant" in 1954 opposite Robert Wagner in the title role, and twice appeared on screen with her husband, movie idol Tony Curtis, in "The Vikings" and "Houdini". Over the course of her career she was paired with some of Hollywood's hunkiest actors, including Errol Flynn, Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart and Paul Newman. She co-starred with daughter Jamie Lee -- a major Hollywood star in her own right -- in the 1980 horror film "The Fog." Leigh's last movie was "A Fate Totally Worse than Death," in 2000. Leigh married four times, most famously in 1951 to actor Tony Curtis, father of her daughters. She and Curtis were celebrated as the toast of Hollywood. They divorced in 1962 and she married Brandt, a businessman, a year later.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A group of 186 former ambassadors, including the son of war hero-turned-president Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican icon, on Monday threw their weight behind Democratic contender John Kerry in the race for the White House. John Eisenhower, 82, joined the group in strongly criticising the foreign policy of President George W. Bush's administration. Eisenhower said he ended five decades of support for the Republican after the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003. He condemned "the arrogance and go-it-alone that we've seen" during the Bush term in office. Eisenhower helped his father, who was president from 1953 until 1961, write his memoirs. He was the US ambassador to Belgium from 1969 until 1971. He said he remembers the regular contacts President Eisenhower -- who had earlier been commander of allied forces for the 1944 D-Day invasion of Normandy, France -- had with Bonn, Paris and London to maintain western unity during the Cold War. Pre-emptive war and disregard for allies "are two things against which my father stood for." The younger Eisenhower announced his surprise support for the Democratic challenger in an open letter published by the Union Leader newspaper of New Hampshire on September 28. "As son of a Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower, it is automatically expected by many that I am a Republican," he wrote in the newspaper. "For 50 years, through the election of 2000, I was. With the current administration's decision to invade Iraq unilaterally, however, I changed my voter registration to independent, and barring some utterly unforeseen development, I intend to vote for the Democratic presidential candidate, Senator John Kerry." He added that today's Republican party had become "unfamiliar" and had lost its sense of "responsibility" in foreign affairs. "America, though recognised as the leader of the community of nations, has always acted as a part of it, not as a maverick separate from that community and at times insulting towards it. "Leadership involves setting a direction and building consensus, not viewing other countries as practically devoid of significance." Eisenhower was a rare Republican, however, in the latest group of diplomats and top officials to publicly express opposition with the Bush administration. Most of the 186 are Democrats who were career diplomats or political appointees to ambassador posts. But the group highlighted that all had served loyally under Democratic and Republican administrations. Also on the list are Walter Mondale, vice president in Jimmy Carter's administration, and the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who was ambassador to India. The use of former diplomats in political campaigns is a regular occurence for US elections but the organisers of the initiative say there are four times as manle bit. "After the announcement, I rang Colin when I was in France and to be honest it wasn't much of a of a conversation. "I just phoned him to say 'look I know you are behind me 100 percent, I was behind you 100 percent' and basically we then just had a chat about life off the field. "I am glad we just broke the ice and had a chat." Thomas added: "Working together with Colin there will be two different styles, but hopefully those different styles will bring something special to the team. "As far I am concerned I don't have a particular style to my captaincy. I will do it the way I think it should be done and the way I believe it will be beneficial for the team. "Colin is obviously going to play a big role in that." Thomas does not believe there will be any problems with him captaining the side from full-back. "There have been a lot of people saying it is an impossibility to lead a side from full-back, I disagree with that. I think you can lead a tthe autumn series will be against Tri-Nations champions South Africa on November 6. Ruddock confirmed the Ospreys pair of centre David Bishop and flanker Richie Pugh, as well as Dragons full-back Kevin Morgan, will join up with the squad as reward for their impressive recent form in the Celtic League.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[US stocks notch up solid gains as oil prices cool.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US stocks notched up solid gains in morning trading Monday, extending last week's rally as oil prices cooled and optimism about the economy remained despite an unexpected slip in factory orders. At 1622 GMT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 45.94 points, or 0.45 percent, at 10,238.59 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was higher 16.26 points, or 0.84 percent, at 1,958.46. The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index climbed 5.96 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,137.46. "We're seeing some follow-through from Friday," said Jay Suskind, director of trading at Ryan, Beck and Co. "There's a sense of optimism that the economy is going well." Suskind cited the continuing sell-off in bonds and better-than-expected second quarter economic growth as indicators of a strengthening economy. A dip in oil prices below the 50-dollar mark also lent the market some relief Monday after the price of a barrel closed over 50 dollars for the first time in New York on Friday. However, orders for US-made factory goods unexpectedly slipped in August as demand for new civilian aircraft plunged, government figures showed. Orders fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said, defying widespread predictions by economists for a gain of 0.1 percent and partially reversing a 1.7-percent surge in July. "The headline number is a little weaker than expected but the report as a whole is still indicative of solid factory conditions," said RBS Greenwich Capital Markets economist Steve Stanley. The general upbeat outlook was underwritten by a National Association of Business Economists panel which determined the US economy will grow solidly in 2005 despite high oil prices, no matter whether President George W. Bush or Democratic rival John Kerry is in the White House. On the stock front, software group PeopleSoft remained in focus after firing its chief executive, Craig Conway, last week, as speculation mounted it would clear the way for Oracle's 7.7 billion dollar hostile takeover. At 1622 GMT, PeopleSoft was trading down 47 cents, or 2.06 percent, at 22.36 dollars. Insurance giant American International Group said staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were considering recommending that the regulator file a civil suit against AIG alleging it violated federal securities laws. The possible civil suit hinges on three AIG press releases related to three deals marketed by AIG Financial Products Corp (AIGFP). The SEC declined to comment on the AIG statement. AIG was trading down seven cents, or 0.10 percent, at 68.65 dollars. Lockheed Martin Corp was weaker despite announcing that a Lockheed-led team of technology and telecommunications heavyweights has won a potential three-billion-dollar contract from the US Postal Service to revamp its vast data communication networks. The deal requires the Lockheed team to provide managed network services across the entire US Postal Service, covering over 37,000 locations. Lockheed Martin was trading lower 23 cents, or 0.41 percent, at 56.09 dollars. Also in focus was office supplies giant Office Depot which announced that its chairman and chief executive Bruce Nelson had resigned. The Florida-based group gave no reason for Nelson's abrupt departure. Office Depot said Nelson's resignation had been "by mutual agreement," and said board member Neil Austrian, 64, will serve as interim CEO until a successor is found. The office group was trading up 12 cents, or 0.80 percent, at 15.20 dollars. Bonds fell on the movement into equities. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 4.205 percent from 4.191 percent Friday while that on the 30-year bond gained to 4.961 percent from 4.949 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[OSLO, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Portraits of former US president Richard Nixon which were hung in the Norwegian parliament have been removed after a number of the country's parliamentarians complained that the paintings were "shocking", officials said on Monday. "Following an evaluation, it was determined that the piece was unfitting and potentially shocking," Secretary General of the parliament Hans Brattestaa told AFP. As a result of the MPs' complaints, the three-portrait series of Nixon holding a cup of coffee in his hand were taken down only a few days after they were hung in a new foreign affairs committee meeting room in the parliament building. "On one hand (the work) delivers a political message that is not the most appropriate," Brattestaa said, adding that the portraits would be exposed in "a more insignificant place". Republican Nixon, who led America from the White House from 1969 until 1974, was the first US president to resign from office. He resigned on August 9, 1974 while faced with almost certain impeachment for his role in the Watergate scandal, in which it was revealed that burglars connected to his administration had tried to plant listening devices in the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate building in Washington, and that Nixon had ordered the FBI to abandon its probe of the break-in. "I can accept total artistic freedom, but I don't think that the meeting room of the Foreign Affairs Committee is the most appropriate place to exhibit this kind of expression in respect to the former head of state and politician," said former Norwegian prime minister and current head of the committee Thorbjoern Jagland.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[France vows 'discreet' bid to free journalists in Iraq.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[France vowed Monday to work "with discretion and a sense of responsibility" in its bid to free two French reporters held hostage in Iraq, amid a flurry of angry finger-pointing over a botched rescue plan by a French MP. "Our only demand until the effective release of Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot will remain their safety," Foreign Minister Michel Barnier said after the government held an emergency meeting to discuss developments on the two seasoned reporters. "On the ground, we will continue to work until this release with discretion, perserverance, a sense of responsibility but also patience," Barnier said. Malbrunot of Le Figaro newspaper and Chesnot of Radio France International, were abducted south of Baghdad August 20 along with their Syrian driver. The three men are believed to be in the hands of an insurgent group calling itself the Islamic Army of Iraq. Barnier made no reference to a failed freelance mission to secure the two men's release by Didier Julia, a 70-year-old member of President Jacques Chirac's ruling UMP party. Julia returned to the French capital late Monday after spending four days in the Syrian capital of Damascus overseeing the liberation efforts. Julia earned the reprobation of France last Friday, when he declared there was a convoy carrying the journalists out of Iraq -- along with his associate, a former French navy commando named Philippe Brett who he said had arranged their release -- but it failed to materialise. Julia's assertions revealed inconsistencies and raised questions about the extent the MP might have collaborated with officials from France or other countries. Chirac's office took the unusual step of saying government authorities "only discovered the reality of the operation run by Mr Julia from Damascus after it had been started" following a report in Le Monde newspaper claiming the president knew about the "fiasco" all along. That newspaper and others suggested the condemnation officials levelled at Julia after the mission failed might have been to cover up government involvement in an operation to free the reporters -- possibly by paying a ransom -- away from public scrutiny. On the weekend, Chirac slammed Julia's "interference" while Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said such private initiatives could create "a threat for our fellow countrymen". The opposition Socialist party's spokesman, Julien Dray, said Julia had probably "not acted as a lone gunslinger" and warned Raffarin would be grilled on the matter in parliament on Tuesday. For his part, Julia said on arriving back in Paris that he had had "no mandate either from the presidential office or anybody else." Chirac's spokesman, Jerome Bonnafont, earlier said that French officials "never approved, nor backed the personal initiative of Didier Julia and his collaborators." He added that "much information is being transmitted to French authorities" about the hostages. Each lead is weighed carefully, he said, but information Julia provided on September 27 about his operation was too "imprecise" to warrant a response. Chesnot and Malbrunot's families issued a statement Monday asking "all of France's representative figures to not get into debates that could undermine the national consensus and, at the same time, have consequences on the liberation of Christian and Georges." They called on "the responsibility and discretion of everybody so that negotiations resume in the necessary calm."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ROME, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The brother of an Italian-based Iraqi businessman who had been held hostage in Iraq for more than a month said Monday he had learnt from Italy's foreign ministry that he had been murdered. Emad Wali said he had been informed of his brother Ajad Anwar Wali's slaying in a phone call from a foreign ministry official. The Wali brothers have lived in northern Italy for more than 20 years, and the elder Ajad had gone to Iraq to sell Italian-manufactured equipment. He had been held hostage since August 31. Islamic militants in Iraq earlier sent a video to AFP in Baghdad showing Wali, 44, and 33-year-old Turkish national Yalmaz Dabja, being shot dead after "confessing" to the camera that they were spies. The video, whose authenticity was impossible to verify, was dated October 2. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi expressed his "sorrow" at the news and said the escalating attacks in Iraq only "strengthen the government's determination to fight international terrorism." The Wali family strongly denied that the businessman, who fled the regime of Saddam Hussein to study and settle in Italy, was a spy. "He wasn't a spy. He collaborated neither with the Italian government nor any foreign government," the family said in a statement from their home in Castelfranco Veneto, near the northern city of Treviso. In the video, one hostage is shown admitting to establishing contacts with Israeli intelligence services "who wanted to buy uranium and (radioactive) red mercury, Turks who asked me to kill (Kurdish leader) Jalal Talabani and Iranians." The second admitted to having been offered "10 million dollars by the Turkish security services and 30 million dollars by the Israelis" to provide them with red mercury. In the tape, five masked men brandishing guns and standing behind the two kneeling hostages identify themselves as "fighters of God" and read out a list of accusations against the pair. It then shows them being shot several times in the back of the head by at least two of the militants.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[SpaceShipOne wins big prize, launches new era of private space travel.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MOJAVE, California, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Ushering in an era of commercial space travel, a private manned rocketship blasted into space for the second time in five days Monday, snatching a 10-million-dollar prize aimed at spurring galactic tourism. In a flawless mission, SpaceShipOne, piloted by former US navy test pilot Brian Binnie, smashed the sub-orbital flight altitude record, reaching 368,000 feet (70 miles/114 kilometers) and entering the fringes of space, according to preliminary radar readings. "Today we made history," said Peter Diamandis, president of the Ansari X Prize Foundation, which offered the prize in a bid to encourage space tourism, as thousands cheered the space craft back to Earth. "Today the winners are the people of Earth," he said as SpaceShipOne was towed towards a cheering crowd after the 90 minute space foray over California's Mojave desert. "Today we go to the stars." "We blew the X-15 away," Diamandis added in a reference to SpaceShipOne breaking the record for sub-orbital flight set by the X-15 rocket plane more than 40 years ago. The X-15, jointly developed by NASA and the US military, set an altitude record of 354,200 feet (67 miles/108 kilometers) on August 22, 1963. As SpaceShipOne touched down, its designer, aviation pioneer Burt Rutan, stood alongside British tycoon Richard Branson and Diamandis on the Mojave airport tarmac leaping for joy and cheering. Branson, owner of the Virgin Atlantic airline, last week announced plans to join the private space race using a craft based on SpaceShipOne, offering passengers space jaunts for about 200,000 dollars a trip. He described Monday's flight as a "magnificent achievement" and said he was looking forward to receiving the first spacecraft for his Virgin Galactic spaceline from Rutan by 2007. To win the X Prize, the same reusable manned spacecraft needed to make two journeys into space within two weeks while carrying the equivalent weight of two passengers. Rutan was jubiliant over winning the X Prize and achieving his goal of smashing the X-15 record by around 13,000 feet (2.5 miles/4.0 kilometers). Long an outspoken adversary of the mainstream space industry and NASA, Rutan cocked a victorious snoot at his rivals, deriding what he called the "Boeings, the Lockheeds, the naysayers in Houston." "If they got a look at how this flight was run and how we developed the capabilities of this ship and its safety, I think they would look at each other right now and say 'We're screwed,'" he said. "I have a hell of lot bigger goal than they do," he said vowing to develop a commercial spacecraft for Branson that would be "at least 100 times safer than anything that is ever flown into space." Birned up, including "Star Trek" actor William Shatner, music mogul Quincy Jones, jazz musician Herbie Hancock and Kiss rock group singer Gene Simmons. On Monday, one of SpaceShipOne's sponsors, softdrink maker 7 UP, announced it would offer consumers a prize of the first free tickets to space in a competition that has yet to be finalised. Rutan selected October 4 to coincide with the 47th anniversary of the 1957 launch of the Soviet Union's first satellite, Sputnik I, which sparked the original space race between Moscow and Washington. Organisers who proposed the competition hope it will spawn an age of space travel rivalling the dawn of commercial air transport in the late 1920s. The X Prize, funded by private donors, was established in 1996 and modelled on the 25,000-dollar Orteig prize that aviator Charles Lindbergh won when he became the first solo pilot to cross the Atlantic in 1927.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAMARRA, Iraq, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Iraqi men and women ventured out onto the streets of Samarra on Monday as they struggled to resume their lives after a weekend of death and destruction. Repair workers with cranes fixed downed power lines and mosques announced by loudspeakers that it was safe to walk the streets and exit the city, after an estimated 5,000 US and Iraqi forces wrested control of the 250,000-community from insurgents on Friday. The US military lifted a three-day closure of the Sunni Muslim city and power was partially restored, said Colonel Randy Dragon of the 1st Infantry Division. Food was handed out at mosques amid concerns families' food supplies were running low in the aftermath of the US-Iraqi military campaign. But even as the Iraqis walked around the city, they expressed a mixture of anger and fear against the backdrop of buildings scarred by bullets and reduced to rubble. Iraqis remained convinced that bodies were buried in shallow graves in people's front yards and abandoned in buildings. And they worried US troops might shoot them. Men and young boys strolled down the streets with white flags. At the city's general hospital, doctors pleaded with Colonel Dragon to let them send out ambulances to pick up the dead and wounded. They had gone out with US troops to do so Sunday when they had collected seven bodies, but they did not feel safe. Dragon assured them they could move freely in the city and Salahuddin province's governor Hamad Hamoud quickly announced they would put ambulances in every neighborhood to whisk out any remaining dead and wounded. The hospital was first to be shut down as the staff sanitized the building after a weekend that saw 50 corpses piled up rotting in the corridors. Most of Samarra's sick were to be taken to Tikrit as a temporary measure. The governor told Dragon they needed to let in convoys of supplies to avoid food shortages and the colonel insisted trucks could come in freely now. Checkpoints were in place around the city but anyone could enter after being searched, he said. But few believed the Americans. Even the city's mayor, Tareq al-Samarrai, said, "No one can enter or exit." Dragon said he such mistrust and skepticism was only to be expected. At least 150 people died and scores were wounded in the two-day joint offensive against Samarra, a city north of Baghdad that had been in the grip of rebels since June. "The operation with Iraqi forces has ended within 72 hours. They have a little anxiety and it will take a while to overcome," he said. While the Americans have 20 million dollars (16 million euros) to spend on Samarra, so far only two million dollars has been made immediately available. US troops have been working to restore power to the city since Sunday after shutting down the power grid last Thursday on the eve of their operahe promise of some sort of help to tide the man over through the hard times. They quickly kissed on the cheek, while Hamoud's bodyguard discreetly watched, gripping a small revolver beneath his coat. Hamoud smiled, pleased with his politicking and quipped about his efforts to woo the man over with same patronage style of the old regime: "It's just like Saddam Hussein."]]></c>

Wasserstein aimed to get the board's approval to seek registration for an initial public offering from US stock market regulators although he was uncertain the meeting would be "decisive", the another source close to the matter said Monday. Wasserstein's plans for an initial public offering won the support last week of Lazard chairman, Michel David-Weill, who agreed to sell his nine-percent stake in the group. However, Wasserstein still has to get the green light from the investment house's partners for the IPO, which is reportedly worth three billion dollars. The Financial Times reported Monday that Wasserstein set a deadline of noon Monday New York time for partners to agree to the proposal after certain partners threatened not to sign. The FT, which did not name its source, said some partners feared the plan gave Wasserstein too much power to vote their shares and draw up governance rules.

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Monday urged Israel and the Palestinians to show "maximum restraint" in the Gaza Strip as the Israeli army warned its massive offensive there could last for weeks and the death toll surged. The State Department reiterated Washington's belief that Israel had a right to defend itself against terrorist attacks but called on the Jewish state to "minimize the humanitarian consequences" of the operation and to spare civilians. "The United States remains concerned about what's happening in the region," deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said. "We continue to speak with all parties and urge them to exercise maximum restrint and avouid actions that escalate tension. "We also are urging all sides to take every measure to avoid civilian casualties and we are urging the Israelis to minimize the humanitarian consequences of their actions," he said. "At the same time, we reiterate Israel's right to defend itself." Last week, Ereli had urged Israel to use "only proportional force" in its Gaza operation but he declined on Monday say whether the Israelis had heeded Washington's call. "I am not going to get into a mathematical discussion at this point of what's proportional and what's not proportional," he said. Since Israel began the operation six days ago, at least 73 Palestinians have been killed in the deadliest incursion into Gaza since the start of the intifada, or uprising, in 2000. On Monday, eight Palestinians, including a child and a teenage girl, were killed by Israeli fire. Israel's chief of staff said Monday that the opeation, which is intended to establish a buffer zone to prevent Palestinian militants from firing rockets at Israel, could last for weeks. The Gaza incursion has sparked deep international concern, including a weekend call from UN chief Kofi Annan for Israel to halt the operation. On Monday, Egypt called the incursion a "dangerous escalation". Britain expressed concern Monday that the Israeli army is causing civilian deaths, injuries and unnecessary suffering. The United States has thus far declined to criticize its main Middle East ally but Ereli said that Washington did "regret the loss of civilian life." "We are concerned when civilians are the victims of armed conflict, it's something that we speak about," he said. "At the same time, we recognize that there are terrorist activities being conducted from Gaza and that Israel has a right to defend itself. A senior State Department official told reporters later, on condition of anonymity, that US ambassador to Israel, Daniel Kurtzer, had been pressing Israeli authorities on the matter. "Kurtzer has been in there saying don't let this get out of hand, don't make things worse," the official said. Despite the appeals, Israel massively stepped up a smaller incursion into northern Gaza last Wednesday after two children were killed by a rocket.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[France to deport Algerian Muslim cleric who defended wife-beating (ADDS quote from lawyer).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[France said Monday it was taking all steps necessary to deport an Algerian Muslim cleric for publicly defending wife-beating, after the country's top administrative court overturned the suspension of his expulsion order. The court's decision "confirms the sound motives behind the expulsion of Mr (Abdelkader) Bouziane decided by the interior ministry on February 26, 2004," the ministry said in a statement. "It also puts an end to the suspension by the Lyon judge of the ministerial deportation order," it added. "The ministry is taking all necessary steps to put this legal ruling into action." Bouziane's lawyer said the cleric was "very disappointed" but is ready to face deportation. Bouziane "is at home in Lyon," and "is ready to present himself to police" to be deported, Mahmoud Hebia told journalists. Bouziane, 52, was the first imam to be deported this year under an interior ministry directive to expel those who preach fundamentalism to some of France's five million Muslims. The move came after Bouziane, who preaches in a mosque in a Lyon suburb, gave an interview to a local magazine in which he endorsed wife-beating, declared he was polygamous and expressed the wish that "the entire world become Muslim." Abdelkader Bouziane was expelled to Algeria on April 21 but returned to France the following month. But three days later, an administrative tribunal ruled the expulsion illegal, since he was never charged with a crime and not allowed to defend himself, and the imam was granted a return visa from Algiers. In June he was put under judicial investigation, one step short of formal charges, for "justification of a crime and direct provocation." The case has proved an embarrassment to the government, which has deported several other imams before but mainly because they urged a jihad, or holy war, against the West.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Malcolm Glazer became a self-made billionaire by knowing how to pick winners. Now the 76-year-old shopping mall tycoon and sports mogul appears to have plucked his greatest prize - Manchester United. The world's richest football club, with supporters around the globe, said Monday it had received a preliminary takeover deal amid reports that Glazer, one of the world's wealthiest men, was set to boost his holdings in the team. Glazer owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of American football, having bought the National Football League club in 1995 for a then-record 192 million dollars. The Bucs are now worth 779 million dollars, ninth-best in the 32-team NFL according to Forbes magazine, which rates Glazer among the 250 richest people on the planet, himself and United valued about the same at 1.1 billion dollars. In addition to boosting profits with a new 200 million-dollar stadium that has already hosted a Super Bowl, one that comes complete with a pirate ship. Glazer improved the Bucs' marketing by dumping ugly orange uniforms and a dandy-esque mascot for a red and black outfit with a pirate flag logo. By hiring top talent and a top coach in Jon Gruden, Glazer also turned the Bucs from laughing stocks to champions. Tampa Bay defeated Oakland 48-21 in Super Bowl 37 in 2003 at San Diego for the club's first NFL crown. Buccaneers running back Mike Alstott, an all-star rusher, praised Glazer for turning the team around in a profile on the club website. "Mr. Glazer is why were here," Alstott said. "He came in and built the franchise up, allowed us to get some players in here that cared about winning. It has to start from the owner if youre going to get anywhere and be competitive in this league." Glazer owns First Allied Corporation, a holding company which owns shopping malls and other real estate developments in 19 states. The Palm Beach, Florida, resident has many of his six children involved in team and business affairs. Last month, Glazer bought enough shares for a controlling interest in Zapata Oil, a company founded by former president George Bush. Glazer's toughness was built as a teen during World War II. He began working in his fathers watch-parts business at age eight. When his father died, a 15-year-old Glazer took over the family business and built an empire. His investments now include food service equipment, packaging and supplies, broadcasting, health care, banking, natural gas and oil protection, Internet publications, stocks, government securities and corporate bonds. Glazer reportedly had interest in purchasing the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball at one stage but was unable to complete a deal. Still, he knows a valuable sports asset when he sees one. The Dodgers have one of the most famous ballparks and loyal followings in the sport and reached the playoffs this year for the first time since 1996. Glazer raised his stake in Manchester United to 16.3 percent earlier this year, sparking talk of a takeover bid. The Malcolm Glazer Family Partnership released a statement at that time praising the club. The partnership "has great admiration for Manchester United's rich history, loyal fans, great players, outstanding managers, winning tradition and for investment purposes", the statement said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MOUNT ST. HELENS, Washington, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Mount St. Helens spewed out more steam on Monday after new seismic tremors that led some experts to warn the volcano could explode at any time. The volcano ejected steam followed by "a small amount of ash" in an eruption that lasted some 10 minutes at 9:47am (1647 GMT), said Tim McBicker, a spokesman for the US Geological Survey (USGS). Although it has stopped, McBicker said "there will be additional eruptions." Monday's eruption was similar to one on Friday that sent a huge cloud of steam and some ash into the air, USGS spokeswoman Catherine Puckett told AFP. A tremor shook St. Helens early Sunday for 25 minutes, prompting scientists to warn of an imminent eruption two days after the volcano roared back to life. Authorities elevated their alert level to the maximum third level over the weekend and diverted flights away from the volcano's area. Visitors were evacuated from a five-mile (8 kilometer) radius around the mountain, including the USGS Johnson Ridge Observatory. The volcano killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980 after weeks of quakes, slides and tremors and after belching smoke, steam and ash. St. Helens erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the same intensity.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Monday more offensives by US and Iraqi forces like one just ended in the city of Samarra were needed to rid the country of safe havens for insurgents. "What has to be done in that country is what happened in Samarra over the last 48 hours," he said in a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations. "You cannot allow a series of safe havens or a consistent pattern of misbehavior, anti-social behavior, violence against the government of Iraq to go on over a sustained period of time," he said. "You can't allow that, or you don't have a country, or people don't feel they have a stake in it," he said. At least 150 people were killed and scores wounded in two days of fighting for Samarra, a predominantly Sunni Muslim city north of Baghdad, which had been in rebel hands since June. Rumsfeld said diplomacy backed by the threat of force was the preferred means to regain cities controlled by the insurgents, but it had not always worked. "Finally you may have to use force, and that's what happened," he said. "My guess is that's what you'll see in Iraq -- the government systematically deciding they are not going to accept the idea of safe havens, and foreign terrorists, and former regime elements running around threatening and killing people," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Profiles of Republican Vice President Dick Cheney and Democratic challenger Senator John Edwards who will take part in a debate Tuesday by vice-presidential candidates ahead of the November 2 US election: DICK CHENEY Demonised by Democrats, Dick Cheney is widely seen as the eminence grise of President George W. Bush and is one of the most powerful vice presidents in American political history. Cheney was sent into a White House bunker after the September 11, 2001 attacks and has kept a low profile for much of the Bush administration. He has been one of the hardline defenders of the Iraq invasion and mired in controversy over past links to Halliburton, the oil services giant that has huge US military contracts. But when Cheney speaks, the sparks often fly and his comments nearly always make news. Under pressure after months of Democratic criticism over Halliburton, a company he ran until joining the Bush campaign in 2000, Cheney used the F-word in June against Democratic senator Patrick Leahy. He annoyed the Democratic campaign last month by strongly hinting that the United States would face a bigger threat of a new September 11-style attack if voters choose Democrat John Kerry for president on November 2. "Am I the evil genius in the corner that nobody ever sees come out of his hole. It's a nice way to operate, actually," Cheney said of himself in a rare interview with American newspapers in January. Cheney has, however, also shown an ability to shock even American conservatives, coming out in favour of gay marriages after years of opposition. His eldest daughter is a lesbian. Cheney has decades of experience in Washington power politics. He was the defence secretary during the 1991 Gulf War and a chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, a member of the House of Representatives. Cheney was head of a committee looking for a vice presidential candidate for Bush. The committee decided he would be the best candidate. Despite his fragile health after several heart attacks, disquiet about the Halliburton controversy and Democrat attacks on the way he avoided Vietnam war service, Bush has insisted that Cheney remains his trusted number two. "I admit it, he's not the prettiest face in the race," the president has said of Cheney. "I didn't pick him for his looks. I picked him for his judgment, his experience, his ability to get the job done." JOHN EDWARDS Youthful, optimistic, but with relatively little political experience, John Edwards, the Democratic contender for the vice presidency, is almost completely the opposite to Cheney. Edwards earned a fortune as a personal injury trial lawyer -- an area in which the Bush administration wants to clamp down on huge awards made. He turned to politics after the death of his 16-year-old son winning a senate seat for North Carolina at his first attempt six years ago. Turning on his southern charm, Edwards, 51, gave John Kerry a run for his money in the Democratic nomination race. He was always the favourite to become Kerry's running-mate, adding a touch of glamour and fresh air to Kerry's stiff persona. Edwards plays up his humble origins as the son of a mill worker and has built a reputation as a champion of the poor. "We still live in two different Americas -- one for people who have lived the American Dream and don't have to worry, and another for most Americans who work hard and still struggle to make ends meet," he says in speeches that highlight the lost jobs and struggle for health care that many Americans go through. "It doesn't have to be that way," he tells rallies. Some people see Edwards as future presidential candidate material. At the moment age goes against him and he has played the role of a loyal aide to Kerry, sticking to raising the campaign profile in small towns while Kerry takes centre stage in the battle against Bush. Edwards was born June 10, 1953 in South Carolina and raised in neighbouring North Carolina, the state he represents in the US Senate. At 11, he wrote a school essay "Why I Want to Be a Lawyer." His mission: to rise from his modest origins and "protect innocent people from blind justice the best I can." He proved a brilliant attorney, representing parents who lost their children in botched hospital deliveries, and children who lost their parents in car wrecks. Edwards once convinced a jury to award 25 million dollars to a nine-year-old girl who was severely injured in a badly built swimming pool. Success came swiftly in politics. He dispatched an incumbent Republican senator in the 1998 election.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The Paris suburb of Montreuil-sous-Bois has banned two fashion shows featuring veiled Muslim women, saying the events -- closed to men -- could disrupt public order, officials said Monday. In an official order, a copy of which was sent to AFP, the town's authorities banned "Ready-to-wear for Muslim women", an event that was to have taken place in Montreuil-sous-Bois on Sunday and next Sunday, October 10. The order said the catwalk shows were banned as they aimed to "show the fashion relevance of items of clothing such as the hijab and the burqa", "trivialize the wearing of the Islamic headscarf" and were closed to men. "A serious disruption to public order could result," the order said. Officials said the town, led by Communist-linked mayor Jean-Pierre Brard, made the decision after complaints from several pro-secularism associations. Police said the show scheduled for Sunday had not taken place, but an Internet chat room said the second catwalk event would go on as planned next Sunday somewhere in the Paris area, without naming a specific site. The announcement that the two shows organized by the "Jasmeen" label were cancelled came as spring-summer 2005 fashion week began in Paris, bringing together the world's elite designers for eight jam-packed days of shows.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Campaigning Bush signs tax cut extension (CHANGES dateline, ADDS details).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CLIVE, Iowa, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President George W. Bush on Monday signed into law a 146-billion-dollar tax cut extension, one month before the hotly-contested US election that pits him against Democrat John Kerry. Speaking to cheering supporters four days before the second presidential debate, the president renewed his call for making permanent the 10-year, trillion-dollar tax cuts at the heart of his economic agenda. "The tax relief comes at just the right time for America," said Bush, whose visit to the battleground state of Iowa guaranteed him local headlines and evening newscasts in this hotly contested state. "We need to make all the tax relief permanent." Bush, who stands to become the first US president since the Great Depression to oversee a net job loss, promised that the tax reduction "will have good effects throughout the economy." The president then took his tax-cutting show on the road, touting the benefit of lower taxes on voters in Iowa at a campaign rally. "It's a problem when you've got a family-owned business and the tax code forces you to sell it," Bush said, urging the elimination of inheritance taxes. "We need to get rid of the death tax forever." He also said the tax cuts helped to create jobs. "When they start taking money out of employers' pockets. they will be less likely to hire someone," he said. Although some economists have called the legislation a budget buster, the tax cut enjoyed the election-year support of Bush, Kerry, and an overwhelming majority of lawmakers in the US Senate and House of Representatives. It marked the fourth major tax cut enacted by Congress at the urging of Bush, estimated to be worth 146 billion dollars over 10 years. Analysts said the bill may give Bush a political victory going into the November 2 election, but Kerry also endorsed the measure as offering middle class relief. "Millions of American families are being squeezed by the weak Bush economy, falling incomes and rising health costs, and we should extend middle class tax breaks to help them," Kerry said just ahead of the final votes. "That is why I support middle class tax cuts, including the tax package now being considered in Congress." But some analysts said the measure puts the federal budget in an even more precarious situation, at a time when a record 422-billion-dollar deficit is predicted.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Twenty-two die, 42 missing as immigrant boat sinks off Tunisia (ADDS Tunisian president, quote, further background).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TUNIS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Twenty-two would-be immigrants drowned and 42 were missing after a boat that was to have carried them across the Mediterranean broke up and sank off the Tunisian coast at the weekend, according to official figures on Monday. The vessel, carrying 75 people in all, sank in the early hours of Sunday, the Tunisian navy said in a statement carried by the official TAP news agency. The vessel was attempting to sail to Italy. Eyewitnesses said the boat broke in two after it had sailed overnight from a beach in Sousse province, on the country's eastern coast. The navy said a helicopter, a launch and a ship were sent out to try and find survivors. "Half an hour after they left, the boat split under the weight of the passengers and broke in two, throwing everybody into the sea," said one witness. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali expressed deep concern at attempts at clandestine emigration causing many victims "mainly from brother countries." He had special talks with the defence and interior ministers following the catastrophe, TAP reported. "The meeting reviewed the circumstances of this tragic accident and the resources mobilised to search and rescue those missing at sea," the report said. Ben Ali had reiterated "the need to redouble efforts to combat the phenomenon of illegal crossing of borders." Calling for measures to prevent clandestine immigration "to save human lives", he also urged "greater coordination between the various agencies involved (coastguard, security forces and military) and stricter checks of persons arriving in Tunisia intending to cross borders illegally." In January, Tunisian lawmakers passed a law aimed at better fighting clandestine immigration to Europe. Eleven survivors were either pulled alive from the water by the navy or managed to swim to shore. Five of those aboard the boat were Tunisian and the remaining 70 Moroccan. Of the 11 survivors, 10 were Moroccans and one a Tunisian. Meanwhile the weekly Tunis Hebdo newspaper said the people in the boat were part of a group of some 280 who had gathered with the intention of trying to reach Europe. The paper said that after the sinking of the boat most of the others -- around 200 in all -- were arrested in the region around the town of Nabeul, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the capital Tunis. Tunis Hebdo said the non-Tunisians in the group had entered the country legally. The beach from where the boat sailed was some 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Tunis, between the coastal towns of Hergla and El Kantaoui. Every year, thousands of people risk their lives by trying to get into southern Europe illegally, mainly by paying middlemen to get them across the Mediterranean on often ramshackle, overcrowded boats. Many of them set off from Libya, which has a 2,000-kilometer-long (1,200 mile) coastline, or Tunisia, with 1,300 kilometers of coastline. They often sail towards the Italian island of Lampedusa, which is only some 100 kilometers from the Tunisian coast. At the weekend, a group of 223 illegal immigrants arrived on Lampedusa and another group of 200 was spotted at sea, port officials said. New Tunisian legislation has brought existing statutes into line with international conventions on clandestine immigration and allowing closer control of Tunisia's territorial waters. It has also set up a system of checks for maritime vessels which could be used to carry would-be immigrants to Europe. The law allows the authorities to maintain a logbook for every sea-going vessel in the country, from the time it is built until it is scrapped.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Monday downplayed Polish comments suggesting its troops in Iraq would be withdrawn next year, saying Warsaw's commitment to the US-led coalition was not "calendar driven." "Throughout our dealings with our coalition partners, our approach to the (foreign military) presence in Iraq has been that decisions on the presence will be driven by the mission and not by the calendar," deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said. "Once that mission is accomplished, the presence of foreign troops can begin to be reduced," he told reporters. "But that will be determined when the mission is accomplished and not on the basis of a calendar date." The stated mission of the coalition is to help Iraqis secure their country for a transitional government to be elected by the end of January and the creation of a permanent government by the end of 2005 or beginning of 2006. Ereli said that timetable could slide or be moved forward depending on circumstances but stressed that Washington had heard nothing formally from Polish officials to indicate troops would be withdrawn before the mission is accomplished. "In our dealings with the Poles, our joint decisions have been mission driven, not calendar driven," he said, brushing aside comments from Polish Defense Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski that Poland would withdraw its 2,500 troops from Iraq by the end of 2005. "All I can tell you is that in our dealings with the Polish government, and this continues to be the case, that while there are dates along the way, the decision on deployment is a mission driven decision, not a calendar driven one," Ereli said. Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski has also said Warsaw wants to withdraw its troops from Iraq during the course of next year, but added that no firm withdrawal date had been decided. Ereli said he had not seen Kwasniewski's remarks and could not respond to them. Earlier, the White House declined comment on the Polish comments but a senior US official suggested that their stated goal might be achievable. "By the end of 2005, the Iraqis will have gone through their entire election cycle, and their security forces will be much greater, both in quantity as well as quality," the official told AFP on condition of anonymity. "We'll see what their (the Iraqis') requirements are." Poland is the fourth largest troop contributor to the US-led coalition in Iraq and heads up a multinational division of 6,000 soldiers in south-central Iraq, but there is strong opposition to the deployment at home.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Boeing predicts healthy world aviation market.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Boeing Co. predicted Monday the world aviation market will pull out of a post-September 2001 slump with two trillion dollars in plane sales in the next 20 years. In the period from 2004 to 2023, the world economy would grow at a pace of 3.0 percent a year, driving traffic passenger growth of 5.2 percent a year and cargo traffic growth of 6.2 percent a year, it said. Boeing forecast a total market potential of 24,993 new commercial airplane sales worth about two trillion dollars over the period. Even after retiring 6,397 planes, the world fleet would double to 34,764. "The long-term forecast for air travel is healthy," said Boeing's annual Current Market Outlook 2004. World air travel had grown in 30 of the past 34 years, contracting only in 1991 and from 2001 to 2003, it said. "Currently, the world air travel market is recovering and 2004 is poised for double-digit traffic growth." Boeing said the market share for the biggest planes such as its 747 or the larger challenger developed by rival Airbus, the double-decker A380, would shrink to four percent from six percent now. Other twin-aisle planes, such its own mid-sized, fuel efficient 7E7 Dreamliner would gain market share to 21 percent from 18 percent now, Boeing said. By 2023, three quarters of the world fleet would be single-aisle planes, it said. The aerospace and aviation group said it expected further deregulation, intensifying competition over the period. "Typically, when deregulation occurs competition increases among airlines," it said. "History shows that competition leads to an increase in new nonstop market and frequency growth, rather than an increase in average airplane size in seats." Most of the growth in the world's airlines will be in increased frequencies and new routes served by small and intermediate-sized planes, it said. "The large airplane market is small," Boeing said. While the intermediate-size fleet would double, the large plane fleet would grow by about one-quarter. Overall, China would lead growth in air travel with demand in more mature economies growing at a slower pace. Over the 20 years, air travel growth was expected to expand by 8.1 percent a year in China, 7.6 percent in Latin America, 6.1 percent across the Pacific, 6.0 percent between Europe and the Asia Pacific, 5.5 percent in the Asia Pacific excluding China and 4.1 percent in Europe. As a result, the North American share of world traffic would shrink to 20 percent from 24 percent and the European share would decline to 12 percent from 14 percent. Meanwhile, the intra-Asia-Pacific share would rise to 18 percent from 15 percent and the Latin American share would double to four percent from two percent.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bush charges Kerry 'dangerous for world peace'.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CLIVE, Iowa, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush signed legislation extending popular tax cuts in this key up-for-grabs state Monday and charged that Senator John Kerry's foreign policy would be "dangerous for world peace." Bush noted that his Democratic rival voted against the 1991 war to oust Saddam Hussein's troops from Kuwait even though "under any scrutiny, we passed the global test" for legitimate military action. "The policies of my opponent are dangerous for world peace. If they were implemented, they would make this world not more peaceful but more dangerous," the president declared at a campaign rally. With less than one month before the November 2 election, Bush also likened Kerry's medical policy proposals to the failed attempt to overhaul health care that was spearheaded by then first lady Hillary Clinton ten years ago. "I believe that decisions ought to be made by you and your doctor. My opponent believes that the federal government ought to be making the decisions," Bush told cheering supporters the Iowa capital of Des Moines. "He's got a system that's creeping toward 'Hillarycare,'" the president said, a reference to Clinton's initiative, which has widely been blamed for costing the Democrats control of the US Congress in 1994. In a day of sharp attacks on the Democrat, the president also said Kerry's proposal to roll back tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans would fall short and that he would have to raise taxes on the US middle class. As he signed the tax extension bill, estimated at 146 billion dollars, Bush renewed his call for making permanent his 10-year, trillion-dollar tax cuts and said those measures had spurred the flagging US economy. "The tax relief comes at just the right time for America," said Bush, whose visit to the battleground state of Iowa guaranteed him local headlines and evening newscasts. "We need to make all the tax relief permanent." Bush, who stands to become the first US president since the Great Depression to oversee a net job loss, promised that the tax reduction "will have good effects throughout the economy." Some of Bush's strikes seemed geared to providing belated rebuttals to Kerry's comments on Thursday during their first presidential debate, which appeared to have cost the president a few percentage points in national polls. Many prominent Republicans scored the 90-minuted exchange on national security as a win for Kerry, amid widespread comment on Bush's annoyed or unsettled looks and frequent shows of impatience. Bush played off Kerry's position that any US preemptive military action ought to pass a "global test," claiming that the senator was giving other nations a veto over Washington's use of force. "Think about that now: Our most solemn duty is to protect you. Can you imagine taking an international poll of nations to determine whether or not we need to protect you." the president asked rhetorically. Kerry prefaced his comments by saying that: "No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America." "But if and when you do it. you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons." Kerry aides have said he deliberately spoke in the past tense to indicate that the United States would act without international support. As Bush's rally wound down, one supporter urged him: "I would like to know if, when you go in to the next debate, if you would stand up and tell that opponent of yours exactly what you're saying today." Bush and Kerry next face off on Friday in the second of three such exchanges. Vice President Dick Cheney and Kerry's running mate, Senator John Edwards, were to clash Tuesday in their only debate.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Work is expected to begin this month on building a new United States embassy in Berlin after years of wranglnig with city authorities over its proposed security perimeter, the embassy press service announced Monday. The new building, due for completion by 2008, will arise next to the Brandenburg in the heart of the city, on the grounds of the old American mission in Berlin that existed until the US entered World War II in 1941. The design by the Moore Ruble Yudell architecture firm of Santa Monica, California, will stand four storeys high "in harmony with the environment," and adapted to the demands of security, the press department said. Germany and the US signed a protocol in in 2002 on the new mission, ending a long-standing dispute over the perimeter that became something of a diplomatic incident in 1999. The then Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen, attending the opening of a new McDonald's restaurant in Berlin, remarked publicly that it was easier to open a McDonald's than an American embassy. The American demand for a 30 metre (yard) wide security perimeter would have forced the city authorities to close two thoroughfares in the heart of the city. The problem was solved when US Secretary of State Colin Powell agreed to reduce the perimieter width to 25 metres.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Monday he has seen no "strong, hard evidence" linking former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein with Al-Qaeda, backing away from his pre-war assertions that contacts between the two went back over a decade. "I have seen the answer to that question migrate in the intelligence community over a period of a year in the most amazing way," he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations after being asked what Saddam's connection to Al-Qaeda was. Rumsfeld said there were differences in the intelligence community as to what the relationship was. "To my knowledge, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence that links the two," he said. The nexus between terrorism and the Iraqi regime was a key point in the US effort to persuade the world that Saddam Hussein had to be dealt with after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. In September 2004, Rumsfeld said the United States had "credible" information that Al-Qaeda and Iraq had discussed safe havens and non-aggression agreements, and that Al-Qaeda leaders have sought contacts in Iraq who could help them acquire weapons of mass destruction. In his comments Monday, Rumsfeld said he had relied on the Central Intelligence Agency for his information in the past, and appeared to blame the intelligence reporting for the way the relationship between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein was portrayed. "I just read an intelligence report recently about one person who's connected to Al-Qaeda who was in and out of Iraq. And it is the most tortured description of why he might have had a relationship and why he might not have had a relationship," he said. "There are reports about people in Saddam Hussein's intelligence service meeting in one country or another with Al-Qaeda people for one person or another, which may have been indicative of something or may not have been," he said. "It may have been something that was not representative of a hard linkage," he said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[At least 22 killed in spate of Iraq bombings; Indonesian hostages free.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[At least 22 people were killed in car bombings Monday in Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul targeting the fledgling Iraqi army, Westerners and the US military, as two Indonesian hostages were freed and militants released a video of the execution of an Iraqi and a Turkish hostage. The two Indonesian women were released at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Baghdad after a three-day ordeal. "They took us when we were on the road from Amman. They put us in a cell but I don't know which city it was. I was scared but they did us no harm and treated us well. Then they decided to release us," Novitasari binti Sugito told AFP at the embassy. Sugito and Istiqomah binti Misnad were coming to Iraq to work as maids for two Lebanese nationals contracted by an Iraqi electronics company. Their employers, as well as six Iraqis traveling with them were all kidnapped by the Islamic Army in Iraq. The positive outcome for the Indonesians capped an otherwise bloody day of car bombs for Iraqis and the release of a video showing the execution of two hostages including an Iraqi with Italian residency, whose death was later confirmed by his brother. Islamic militants in Iraq earlier sent a video to AFP in Baghdad showing Emad Wali, 44, and 33-year-old Turkish national Yalmaz Dabja, being shot dead after "confessing" to the camera that they were spies. The video, whose authenticity was impossible to verify, was dated October 2. In the tape, five masked men brandishing guns and standing behind the two kneeling hostages, identify themselves as "fighters of God" and read out a list of accusations against the pair. It then shows them being shot several times in the back of the head by at least two of the militants. Wali's brother Ajad Anwar Wali's said later that he was informed of his brother's slaying in a phone call from a foreign ministry official. The Wali brothers have lived in northern Italy for more than 20 years, and the elder Ajad had gone to Iraq to sell Italian-manufactured equipment. He had been held hostage since August 31. Officials at Turkey's embassy in Baghdad were not immediately reachable for comment on Dabja's purported killing. In Baghdad, a car bomb exploded outside the walls of an army recruitment centre in the Iraqi capital where hundreds of young men, some already signed up and others hoping to enlist, had been waiting inside. The army recruitment centre is adjacent to the Green Zone, housing US embassy and the interim Iraqi government. The blast killed at least 15 people and wounded 84 according to medics at Yarmuk hospital. Many of the men came from poor southern provinces in hopes of improving their lot. "I came here with 109 of my colleagues from Najaf, we were told to bring relevant papers to sign up to a new special force in the army," said Wafi Mohamed, 32, slapping his head as he waited outside the emergency room. Shortly after the first car bomb a second explosion ripped the centre of Baghdad this time targeting a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles in an area close to several hotels housing Westerners. The attack killed at least four and wounded 17 many of them bystanders. "The dogs have struck again," said a tearful doctor at the Al-Kindi hospital as he comforted the family of one of the victims. The trail of blood spread to the northern city of Mosul where a car bomb exploded near a school killing three, including a child, and wounding 11, half of them children. Two other car bomb attacks hit the city targeting two separate US military convoys, according to the US military. The first one occurred at 4:00 pm (1300 GMT) on Baath street in the centre, wounding one soldier. Onecks including women in children. The US military has been conducting almost daily raids on the city in what it insists are "precision strikes," aimed at flushing out the Zarqawi operatives while minimising what it calls collateral damage. Adding to the carnage, two Iraqis died and six were wounded in a roadside bomb in the rebel stronghold of Ramadi west of the capital, while a police commander and a schoolgirl were killed in separate attacks northeast of Baghdad. And Thamer Abdellatif, a top science ministry official, and a female civil servant, Ikhlas Ghalib, were shot dead in Baghdad, an interior ministry spokesman said. Away from the violence, the US-led military coalition showed signs of weakening as key ally Poland said it will pull all of its troops out of Iraq by the end of 2005 and Italy suggested that forces from Muslim countries should gradually take over from the current US-led troops.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Vice presidential debate takes on new importance by Peter Mackler (INSERTS Lockhart quotes).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Vice President Dick Cheney will square off with his Democratic rival John Edwards in a televised debate Tuesday that suddenly takes on importance for the Republicans after George W. Bush's tepid showing last week. Political analysts agree that vice presidential debates, which go back to 1976, usually have little impact on the race for the White House since voters cast their ballots strictly for the man at the top. But the stakes will be higher in Tuesday's encounter in the midwestern city of Cleveland, coming five days after Bush suffered a clear defeat at the hands of Senator John Kerry in the first of their three debates. Republicans said Cheney would seek to repair the damage from the Democrat's relentless attacks on the Iraq war and renew the focus on Bush's leadership after the September 11, 2001 strikes. The 63-year-old political veteran was also likely to highlight his knowledge and experience, and portray Edwards, a freshman senator from North Carolina, as part of a Democratic team unfit to command the war on terror. Kerry campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart, speaking to reporters in a conference call, made it clear that Edwards would call on his skills as a trial lawyer to take the offensive against Cheney and Bush. He said Edwards would hold the White House "accountable for their record from everything to squeezing the middle class while taking care of the powerful and the well connected to the failed energy plan and to the mess that we are in in Iraq." The 51-year-old Democrat was ready to skewer Cheney as the architect of the administration's security policies that produced chaos in Iraq but led to windfall reconstruction contracts for his ex-company, Halliburton, Lockhart said. Edwards, with unabashed presidential ambitions of his own, also geared for an assault on the Republicans' economic record, which the Kerry campaign plans to hit hard in the final weeks before the November 2 election. Both sides hope to snatch the momentum ahead of the next Bush-Kerry debates scheduled for Friday in the midwestern city of St. Louis, Missouri, and October 13 in the western city of Tempe, Arizona. The first showdown last Thursday had a dramatic effect, with polls showing Kerry's crisp performance helping him erase a five to eight-point Bush advantage and claw his way back into a virtual dead heat. The Democrat cut deeply into the president's hefty edge on the issues of terrorism and the Iraq war while recapturing a solid lead on the economy over Bush, who appeared hesitant and irritated at times. The Republicans vowed the president would do better in the next face-off but are looking to Cheney for damage control when he takes on Edwards in the 90-minute debate at Case Western Reserve University, analysts said. Vice presidential debates have traditionally been written off as side shows to the campaign. retired vice admiral James Stockdale, the independent candidate in 1992, famously asked in his opening statement: "Who am I. Why am I here." But one of the few debates to make a difference might have been Cheney's 2000 meeting with Senator Joseph Lieberman, where he was able to reassure voters of the Republican ticket's depth and gravitas. A poll released Monday by the Annenberg Public Policy Center showed Edwards had a better image among voters than Cheney. Thirty-eight percent rated him favorably and 31 percent unfavorably; 37 percent had a positive view of Cheney and 42 percent were negative. The debate Tuesday will highlight contrasting styles between the balding, dour but savvyovember.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Mike McKenzie, an American football contract holdout for the Green Bay Packers until three weeks ago, was shipped off to the New Orleans Saints here Monday in the National Football League trade. The unhappy cornerback was sent to the Saints with a conditional draft pick for third-string quarterback J.T. O'Sullivan and a second-round pick in 2005. A starter at left cornerback for Green Bay since his 1999 National Football League debut, McKenzie did not report to the club until September 15, two days after the Packers' season-opening triumph at Carolina. After making his debut as a reserve in a September 19 loss to Chicago, McKenzie sustained a hamstring injury four days later in practice and missed the Packers' past two games. Packers coach and general manager Mike Sherman admitted that McKenzie's status had clearly become a distraction. "I really don't see any other way this could have been handled," Sherman said. "We had to have adequate compensation to make a trade happen and the Saints stepped forward." McKenzie, 28, had four interceptions, including one he returned 90 yards for a touchdown, 20 passes defensed and 58 tackles last season. He had a career-high six interceptions as a rookie in 1999. O'Sullivan, 25, led the Frankfurt Galaxy to the NFL Europe World Bowl title in July, completing 120-of-196 passes for 1,527 yards and 10 touchdowns with five interceptions.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States said Monday it had still not reached agreement with Saudi officials on terror suspect Yasser Esam Hamdi's release from US custody and return to Saudi Arabia despite lengthy talks aimed at easing Riyadh's concerns about the terms of his stay there. "Discussions are still ongoing with the Saudis on modalities of repatriation and they have not concluded," deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said. The US-born Hamdi, who has spent nearly three years in isolation in US military custody after being captured in Afghanistan and labelled an "enemy combatant" for allegedly fighting with the Taliban, was to have been released and sent to Saudi Arabia last week under an agreement reached between his lawyers and the US Justice Department. But Saudi authorities have balked at receiving him and expressed concern about the enforceability of certain provisions in the agreement which requires him to renounce his US citizenship and terrorism, imposes stringent restrictions on his travel and say he must report to the US embassy in Riyadh if he wants to leave the country. Hamdi, who was born in the US state of Louisiana but later became a Saudi citizen, has not been charged with any crime and Saudi officials have questioned the legitimacy of the restrictions. Last week, as a Thursday deadline for Hamdi's deportation to Saudi Arabia loomed, US officials said they expected to reach agreement on his release with Saudi authorities "soon" and denied there were any major snags. That deadline has since passed, and on Monday, a senior State Department official hinted that Washington was losing patience with Riyadh's refusal to accept Hamdi, complaining that the Saudis had not raised specific objections to his repatriation. "On the surface of it, there doesn't seem to be any issue that's holding things up, per se, but at the same time, we haven't yet gotten the Saudi green light," the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. "There is no definite answer," the official said. "It's more a question of questions that we have endeavored to answer and we haven't gotten back any (response)."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The US Supreme Court on Monday upheld a ruling that the Visa and MasterCard credit card groups had engaged in anti-competitive practices by banning member banks from issuing credit cards through rival providers owned by American Express and Morgan Stanley. Visa and MasterCard had appealed lower court findings which found their practices were anti-competitive. "The petition was denied," a Supreme Court spokeswoman said, referring to Visa and MasterCard's appeals. The court's justices rejected the appeal without comment. A federal judge in New York had originally ruled against Visa and MasterCard in determining that their card issuing practices prevented member banks from issuing competing credit cards through other networks. While MasterCard expressed disappointment with the Supreme Court move, American Express Co. welcomed its decision to let the lower courts' findings stand. "The Supreme Court's decision means the end, once and for all, of Visa and MasterCard rules that have prevented banks from issuing cards on rival networks," said Kenneth Chenault, American Express chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. "MasterCard is disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen not to review the lower court decisions requiring us to overturn our competitive programs policy," MasterCard said in a statement, adding that it would "compete vigorously" as it moves forward. Morgan Stanley, which owns and markets Discover-branded credit cards, said in a statement it was seeking undisclosed damages from Visa and MasterCard in the wake of the Supreme Court move.]]></c>

The 7-foot center joined Yao Ming as a member of China's Olympic basketball squad, which matched its best-ever showing with an eighth-place finish at the Athens Games. The Knicks also added a perimeter shooter in forward Tracy Murray, a 12-year veteran who has played for Portland, Houston, Toronto, Washington, Denver and the Los Angeles Lakers. Murray, 33, has averaged 9.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in 659 career games. The New Jersey Nets, uncertain about the future of Jason Kidd, signed veteran point guard Travis Best, who spent last season as a backup to Canada's Steve Nash at Dallas, where he averaged 2.8 points and 1.8 assists in 61 games. Best has averaged 7.7 points and 3.6 assists in 632 career games with Indiana, Chicago, Miami and Dallas. Kidd, the Nets' All-Star point guard, is expected to be out until December after undergoing knee surgery. The Nets, NBA runners-up in 2002 and 2003, also sent Kenyon Martin to Denver in a sign-and-trade deal, traded Kerry Kittles and released Lucious Harris during the off-season. The Los Angeles Clippers exercised a contract option to keep forward Chris Wilcox, who averaged 8.6 points and 4.7 rebounds in 65 games last season. The Clippers also signed guard Trajan Langdon, a former first-round pick, and forward Kaniel Dickens. Langdon played 20 games for Efes Pilsen in the Turkish League last season and averaged 14.2 points in 20 games. Dickens played three times for Portland last season, scoring a total of seven points.

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Retired general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was Monday confirmed as Indonesia's next leader as final counting from the country's first direct presidential polls gave him a landslide victory over his predecessor. Yudhoyono, 55, will be sworn in on October 20, one month after a historic vote that saw Indonesians dump incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri for her former security minister, who has pledged to revive the economy, eradicate graft and get tough on terrorists. Sussongko Raharjo, deputy secretary general of the election commission, said of more than 114 million valid votes, 60.6 percent had been for Yudhoyono compared to 39.4 for Megawati. Yudhoyono, who earlier said he was "grateful" for the result, declined to deliver a formal acceptance speech. His representatives said he would wait for Megawati to first concede her defeat. "I will get down to work soon. so that the people will know that the new government will start to work immediately to reach the desired goals," he said. Both he and Megawati have held back on calling the result, although the outcome has been known since the day of the vote -- Indonesia's third this year after a presidential first-round ballot in July and April legislative polls. Nazaruddin Syamsuddin, the election commission chief, hailed the result as a victory for the world's third largest democracy, which emerged from the autocratic grip of former president Suharto in 1998. "It feels that public participation has been so tremendous that it propelled both presidential and vice-presidential candidates to compete healthily," he said. "The fact that all three elections went on peacefully was a remarkable achievement for Indonesian citizens." Yudhoyono has pledged to form a cabinet that will revitalise a moribund economy still to shake off the effects of the 1997 regional financial crisis. Optimism about his promise helped buoy Jakarta markets as the election results were announced. Share prices closed up 2.46 percent at another record finish. The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index was up 20.544 points at 856.449, surpassing its previous record of 835.905 achieved last Friday. In Washington, a spokesman for President George W. Bush congratulated Yudhoyono. "We commend the people of Indonesia on this latest achievement in their country's impressive transition to democracy," spokesman Scott McClellan said, noting that almost 77 percent of those eligible voted. Megawati, who enjoyed popularity as the daughter of founding president Sukarno, was credited during her three years in power with restoring economic and social stability after the chaotic rule of her predecessor Abdurrahman Wahid. But voters deserted her in the election, passing judgement on her failure to attract the foreign investment needed to inject new life into the graft-plagued financial sector and rejecting her image as an aloof and uncaring leader. Yudhoyono campaigned on a ticket of economic reform and battling corruption, but his polished appearance and common touch were seen as the key factors in winning over voters disillusioned with Megawati's hard edges. As security minister he led efforts to track down those behind the October 2002 Bali bombings, winning him the support of the international community which sees him as the best candidate to tackle the growing terrorist threat. The world's largest Muslim-populated nation has suffered attacks including the Bali bombing in which 202 died, a blast last year at Jakarta's Marriott hotel which left 12 dead and a bombing last month at Australia's embassy in Jakarta in which nine people were killed. Those attacks and others have been blamed on the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah regional terrorist group.]]></c>

In his comments Monday, Rumsfeld said he had relied on the Central Intelligence Agency for his information in the past, and appeared to blame the intelligence reporting for the way the relationship between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein was portrayed. "I just read an intelligence report recently about one person who's connected to Al-Qaeda who was in and out of Iraq. And it is the most tortured description of why he might have had a relationship and why he might not have had a relationship," he said. "There are reports about people in Saddam Hussein's intelligence service meeting in one country or another with Al-Qaeda people for one person or another, which may have been indicative of something or may not have been," he said. "It may have been something that was not representative of a hard linkage," he said. Rumsfenk between Saddam and Al-Qaeda. In his comments two years ago, Rumsfeld said the presence of senior Al-Qaeda leaders in Baghdad was backed by "solid evidence," and there was reliable reporting of contacts over the previous decade that had grown in frequence after 1998.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States called Monday for a resumption in talks to end the conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia but made clear it recognized neither the independence of the breakaway Georgian region nor the legitimacy of its weekend elections. The State Department said it had no comment on the result of Sunday's poll contested between five pro-independence candidates and would take no position on claims of fraud and irregularities from the presumptive favorite, Raul Khajimba. Instead, deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said that Washington wanted whoever emerges as the new "president" of Abkhazia to resume talks with Georgian authorities. "The United States does not recognize Abkhazia as an independent state, so I don't really have any comment on these elections," he told reporters. "Our position is to support an international approach to a peaceful resolution of the Abkhaz conflict that respects Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and whatever leadership is in Abkhazia, we would hope that it returns to negotiations toward that end in the near future," he said. The identity of Abkhazia's next chief matters because the picturesque enclave on the Black Sea coast is seen as a potential flashpoint between Georgia's pro-Western leaders and Moscow, which has given its tacit support to the Abkhaz separatists. Sunday's election was the first competetive vote in Abkhazia since the republic declared its independence from Georgia after winning a war 11 years ago, and was held up as proof of its democratic credentials and internal stability. The conflict cost about 10,000 lives and created hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them ethnic Georgians who were forced to flee Abkhazia. Fears of a new conflict have resurfaced though, since Mikhail Saakashvili, a tough-talking US-trained lawyer backed by Washington, was swept to power in Tbilisi late last year in a bloodless revolution. Saakashvili has said he will not rest until Georgia's wayward regions -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- are back under Tbilisi's control. This summer he announced Georgian warships would sink any vessels carrying tourists from Russia to resorts in Abkhazia. That provoked a furious war of words with Moscow. Renewed fighting over Abkhazia would destabilize a south Caucasus region which is soon to become a strategic gateway for oil exports from the Caspian Sea to Western markets.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[UN chief Kofi Annan will launch an investigation into Israeli allegations that Palestinian militants have used UN ambulances to carry weapons and will ask Israel for proof to support its accusations, his spokesman said Monday. However, Annan spokesman Fred Eckhard said the UN secretary general "has no reason whatsoever to doubt" the conclusions of Peter Hansen, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees who demanded a retraction and apology from the Israeli government. "(Annan) intends to call in Israel's ambassador to the UN Dan Gillerman to ask what evidence Israel has to support the allegations and to let him know of his decision to launch an investigation to be conducted by a UN team which will leave New York tomorrow," Eckhard said. The Israeli army released Saturday video footage purporting to show Palestinian militants using a UN ambulance to transport rockets in the Gaza Strip. Israel has been conducting a massive and bloody incursion into the northern Gaza Strip since Tuesday aimed at preventing rocket attacks on Israeli territory. After viewing the footage Sunday, Hansen said the blurry pictures, taken by an Israeli drone, showed nothing more than paramedics throwing a folded portable stretcher into the vehicle. In a letter to Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, Hansen demanded Monday "an immediate public retraction and apology from the government of Israel."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BERLIN, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[In a world first, German scientists have successfully artificially inseminated a white rhinoceros, a highly endangered species, the Berlin-based Leibniz Institute of Zoology and Research for wild animals announced Monday. Lulu, a 24-year-old white rhinoceros housed at Budapest Zoo, is now five months pregnant. The gestation period for a rhinoceros is 18 months, twice that of a human. "We are confident that her baby will be born in good health in 2005," said Robert Hermes, a zoologist at the institute. The northern white rhino lives only in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Garamba National Park, according to the World Wildlife Fund. WWF said there are currently only 30 rhinos like Lulu left in the world, with 10 of them in zoos where they have been unable to reproduce. The Leibniz Institute added that it was preparing for a second insemination of a white rhinoceros in a zoo in Dvur Kralove in the Czech Republic. The white rhinoceros' main threat is man, who for years have slaughtered the animal, primarily for the horns which are considered by some as an aphrodisiac. Next to the elephant, the white rhinos is the world's largest land mammal. An adult can measure up to two metres high and weigh as much as 3.5 tons.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Monday he has seen no "strong, hard evidence" linking former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein with Al-Qaeda, backing away from his pre-war assertions that contacts between the two went back over a decade. "I have seen the answer to that question migrate in the intelligence community over a period of a year in the most amazing way," he told an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations after being asked what Saddam's connection to Al-Qaeda was. Rumsfeld said there were differences in the intelligence community as to what the relationship was. "To my knowledge, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence that links the two," he said. The nexus between terrorism and the Iraqi regime was a key point in the US effort to persuade the world that Saddam Hussein had to be dealt with after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. In September 2002, Rumsfeld said the United States had "credible" information that Al-Qaeda and Iraq had discussed safe havens and non-aggression agreements, and that Al-Qaeda leaders have sought contacts in Iraq who could help them acquire weapons of mass destruction. In his comments Monday, Rumsfeld said he had relied on the Central Intelligence Agency for his information in the past, and appeared to blame the intelligence reporting for the way the relationship between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein was portrayed.

"It may have been something that was not representative of a hard linkage," he said. Rumsfeld added, however, that Saddam and his regime were "not Little Sisters of the Poor." Iraq was on the State Department's terrorist list and made payments for Palestinian suicide bombings, he said. "The relationships between these folks are complicated. They evolve and change over time. In many cases, these different networks have common funders. "In many cases, they cooperate not in a chain of command, but in a loose affiliation, a franchising arrangement, almost, where they go do different things and cooperate," he said. He said most of Al-Qaeda's senior leaders had sworn an oath to Osama bin Laden. "And to my knowledge, even as of this late date, I don't believe (Abu Mussab al-) Zarqawi, the principal leader of the network in Iraq, has sworn an oath, even though. they're just two peas in a pod in terms of what they're doing," he said. Zarqawi's reported presence in Baghdad before the war has been cited in the past by the US administration as evidence of a link between Saddam and Al-Qaeda. In his comments two years ago, Rumsfeld said the presence of senior Al-Qaeda leaders in Baghdad was backed by "solid evidence," and there was reliable reporting of contacts over the previous decade that had grown in frequence after 1998.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Morocco is seeking to deepen cooperation with Spain on combatting international terrorism, Spanish diplomatic sources said Monday, citing a letter to that effect sent by Moroccan King Mohamed VI to Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Zapatero received the letter, whose detailed contents Spanish sources described as "strictly personal," from visiting minister delegate of the Moroccan foreign ministry, Taieb Fassi Sihri. Socialist leader Zapatero met the Moroccan monarch in April, just days after taking office and both countries are keen to deepen ties, particularly in the aftermath of the March 11 train bombings in Madrid. Most of the suspects currently in detention for the bombings, which left 191 people dead in Spain's worst terror attack, are Moroccan nationals. Morocco was itself the scene of a terrorist attack when suspected Islamic extremists carried out a bomb attack in Casablanca in May 2003, killing 45 people including 12 suicide bombers. Spain and Morocco have in recent months pledged to extend bilateral cooperation on a range of other issues, including immigration and fishing.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Iranian President Mohammad Khatami arrived in Khartoum on Monday to start a three-day visit to Africa's biggest country whose government has come under pressure to act over what the United Nations terms a humanitarian crisis in the western region of Darfur. Khatami is due to have talks with Sudanese leaders on bilateral, regional and international issues, and presidential sources said he and Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir began their first meeting soon after the Iranian leader arrived. Details of their talks were not immediately available. Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail told reporters that the visit, the first by Khatami since he became president in 1997, would further strengthen ties and cooperation between Khartoum and Tehran in the commercial, economic, cultural and political fields. Khatami was due to give a speech to the National Assembly on Tuesday and a lecture on dialogue between cultures at Khartoum's Friendship Hall later. The UN Security Council passed a resolution in September threatening sanctions against Sudan's vital oil industry for failing to rein in pro-government Arab militias accused of atrocities in Darfur. The UN says 50,000 people have died since a revolt erupted in February last year, and another 1.2 million made homeless. The Iranian president arrived from a three-day visit to Algeria seen as marking a warming of relations, which were marred by a seven-year rift, when Algiers accused Tehran of backing Muslim radicals. Five cooperation pacts were signed during Khatami's visit there.]]></c>

Sadr also noted that France had prevented the NATO alliance from interfering in Iraq.

		<c><![CDATA[President Bashar al-Assad on Monday sacked eight cabinet members, including the holder of the key post of interior minister, as Syria comes under mounting pressure over its dominant role in Lebanon. The head of Syria's political security service, Major General Ghazi Kanaan, took over the interior portfolio from General Ali Hammud, state media said. The appointment of Kanaan, the long-time director of Syrian intelligence in Lebanon, was seen by diplomats here as a sign Damascus was preparing to return to a more pragmatic policy towards its smaller neighbour. Syria is already in the grip of five-month-old US economic sanctions and now faces the threat of UN Security Council action over its longstanding troop presence in Lebanon. The reshuffle came ahead of a SGafri took over from Nizar al-Assass as justice minister, while engineers' union boss Ghassan Tayara replaced Mohammed Safi Abu Dan in charge of the industry portfolio. At the social affairs and labour ministry, Siham Dalu was replaced by another woman -- Diala Haj-Aref, an academic. The director of the Assad Teaching Hospital, Maher Hussami, took over the health ministry from Iyad Shatti, while Mohammed Ziad Ayubi replaced Mohammed Ziada at the religious endowments ministry. A Syrian official, asking not to be named, said the reshuffle, especially with the new faces in economic posts, were aimed boosting at growth and upgrading public institutions.

		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The oil price in New York slipped below 50 dollars a barrel Monday as rival gangs in the oil-rich Niger Delta signed a ceasefire, but other worries kept the market tense. New York's light sweet, crude contract for November delivery eased 21 cents to 49.91 dollars a barrel. On Friday, the price had settled above 50 dollars for the first time. In London the price of Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November fell 43 cents to 46.19 a barrel. "The Nigeria premium was taken out of the market," said Jim Ritterbusch, analyst at Ritterbusch and Associates. But "there are still a lot of uncertainties," he said. With producers straining to meet global demand for oil, the market is vulnerable to even modest supply shocks. Prices fell after two rebel groups fighting for control of oil resources in the Niger Delta region signed a government-brokered ceasefire and disarmament agreement late on Friday after months of violence. "The main news is the Nigerian one," said Lee Elliott, a trader with GNI-Man Financial in London. "There is a small resolution. A deal has been struck between the rebels and government representatives in Nigeria." Nigerian military officials on Monday announced a halt to operations in the delta. The leader of the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), Mujahid Dokubo Asari, assured his arch rival, Niger Delta Vigilantes chief Ateke Tom, on Sunday that he was ready to keep the peace. Ateke said Monday his group had surrendered its arms to the government. "We have disarmed. There is no more fighting. We are men of peace," he said in his hometown of Okrika. Oil prices had hit record peaks of 50.47 dollars in New York and 46.80 dollars in London on Tuesday of last week after the NDPVF threatened war in the delta and urged oil multinationals to leave. Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest exporter of crude oil and Africa's biggest producer, with proved reserves of some 27 billion barrels. Its light, sweet, low-sulphur crude is particularly well suited for refining into petrol, or gasoline. Even if oil keeps flowing from Nigeria, the low levels of US crude oil and heating-fuel inventories going into the northern hemisphere means that prices are expected to remain high in the coming weeks, analysts said. "Despite prices coming down this morning, there is still support for (US) crude prices at 50 dollars a barrel and above," said Barclays Capital analyst Kevin Norrish in London. Kuwait's energy minister said the emirate would pump up to 200,000 more barrels of crude a day later this month. Kuwait is currently producing to its maximum capacity of 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd), but "we will have an additional output of between 180,000 and 200,000 bpd" once Gathering Center 15 returns to operation later in October, Sheikh Ahmad Fahd al-Sabah told reporters in Kuwait. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in Vienna last month to raise its official production ceiling by one million bpd to 27 million bpd from November 1 to bring it nearly in line with actual output. Kuwait's daily production quota was raised to 2.167 million bpd.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Dan Gillerman, on Monday accused the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees of involvement in "terrorist activities," after his government said an agency ambulance was used by Palestinian militants to carry weapons. After meeting with UN chief Kofi Annan, Gillerman told reporters that he made it "very clear to the secretary general that what we see here is a very worrying pattern of UN involvement in terrorist activities." "Too many times has the UN found either its staff, its personnel, its vehicles or its logistics too near of terrorist activities or being used or maybe even cynically manipulated by terrorists," Gillerman said. "And the mere fact that this is happening time after time after time is something which the UN should be very worried about," he added. Annan called the meeting with Gillerman to discuss Israel's allegations. The Israeli army released Saturday video footage purporting to show Palestinian militants using a UN ambulance to transport rockets in the Gaza Strip. Israel has been conducting a massive and bloody incursion into the northern Gaza Strip since Tuesday, aimed at preventing rocket attacks on Israeli territory. UNRWA chief Peter Hansen demanded a retraction and apology from the Israeli government over its allegations.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US authorities on Monday indicted a Briton accused of aiding "shoe-bomber" Richard Reid's attempt to blow up a Paris-Miami flight with explosives hidden in the soles of his shoes, officials said. Saajid Mohammed Badat was indicted on seven charges, including conspiring with and aiding and abetting Reid to detonate homemade bombs hidden in shoes on US aircraft in 2001, the US Justice Department said. Badat was indicted in Boston, Massachusetts. Badat, 25, was arrested November 27 in Gloucester, England in a series of anti-terror raids and was indicted on similar charges in Britain. He has been in British custody since his arrest. A small amount of explosives were found in his home during the raid, US Attorney General John Ashcroft said. "The US indictment against Saajid Mohammed Badat alleges a conspiracy with Richard Reid that was designed to kill hundreds of Americans," Ashcroft said. The US indictment alleges that Badat and Reid obtained "shoe bombs" to attack US aircraft, created several e-mail accounts to communicate and coordinate the conspiracy and traveled to Pakistan and several European countries. Reid, a British Muslim convert and self-proclaimed disciple of Osama bin Laden, tried to blow up an American Airlines flight two years ago with explosives hidden in his shoes. Reid was sentenced to life in prison in January 2003 after pleading guilty to trying to blow up the aircraft carrying 198 people. An investigation established Reid had help in preparing the attempted strike, since the explosives in his shoes had a hair and fingerprint that were not his own.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Wall Street closes on a high note as oil cools, economic outlook stays firm.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Wall Street closed on a high note Monday, boosted by receding oil prices and on upbeat readings that the US economy is poised for solid growth in 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 23.89 points, or 0.23 percent, at 10,216.54 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was higher 10.20 points, or 0.53 percent, at 1,952.40. The broad market Standard and Poor's 500 index climbed 3.67 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,135.17. Stocks extended last week's closing rally as oil prices, which had closed above 50 dollars for the first time in New York on Friday, fell back under the 50 dollar mark with the New York Mercantile Exchange's November crude futures contract closing at 49.91 dollars a barrel. Buoyant economic expectations also gave the market a lift as a National Association of Business Economists panel determined the US economy will grow solidly in 2005 no matter whether President George W. Bush or Democratic rival John Kerry is in the White House. The panel forecast gross domestic product -- total economic output -- was expected to grow 3.7 percent in 2005 after a 4.3-percent expansion in 2004, despite rocketing oil prices. However, an unexpected fall in US-made factory goods in August, on plunging demand for civilian aircraft, slightly tarnished Monday's optimism. Orders in August fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said, defying widespread predictions by economists for a gain of 0.1 percent and partially reversing a 1.7-percent surge in July. "The headline number is a little weaker than expected but the report as a whole is still indicative of solid factory conditions," said RBS Greenwich Capital Markets economist Steve Stanley. A total 1.53 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, while 1.85 billion Nasdaq stocks were traded. PeopleSoft remained in focus following its firing of chief executive Craig Conway, which some observers believe might clear the way for Oracle's 7.7 billion dollar hostile takeover bid. The software group closed down 63 cents, or 2.76 percent, at 22.20 dollars. The Visa and MasterCard credit card groups expressed disappointment after the US Supreme Court upheld findings they had engaged in anti-competitive practices by banning member banks from issuing credit cards through rival providers owned by American Express and Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanely said it was seeking undisclosed damages from the card issuers while American Express Co. chairman and CEO Kenneth Chenault praised the court's decision. Insurance behemoth American International Group said staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were considering recommending the regulator file a civil suit against AIG alleging it violated federal securities laws. The possible civil suit hinges on three AIG press releases related to three deals marketed by AIG Financial Products Corp (AIGFP). The SEC declined to comment on the AIG statement. AIG closed lower 23 cents, or 0.33 percent, at 68.49 dollars. In other stock news, Lockheed Martin Corp announced a Lockheed-led team has won a potential three billion dollar contract from the US Postal Service to revamp its vast data communication networks. The deal requires the Lockheed team to provide managed network services across the entire US Postal Service, covering more than 37,000 locations. Lockheed closed higher 28 cents, or 0.50 percent, at 56.60 dollars. Bond prices reversed course to trade higher. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond dropped to 4.173 percent from 4.191 percent Friday while the yield on the 30-year bond slipped to 4.933 percent from 4.949 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Russia slams Latvian sentence against Russian WWII partisan.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Russia on Monday blasted last week's decision by Latvia's Supreme Court to uphold a guilty verdict in a war crimes case against an 80-year-old former Soviet partisan. "Court action against an elderly war veteran, which lasted more than five years, is not morally humane," the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. "This is no ordinary criminal case, but a legal precedent that insults millions of the victims of Nazism by equating those who fought Hitler with Nazis and their collaborators," the statement read. The Latvian court found Vasily Kononov guilty of war crimes and sentenced him to a year and eight months in jail but released him immediately as he had already served this term during pre-trial detention. Kononov was in custody in Latvia from August 1998 through April 2000 when he was released on health grounds. His lawyer Alexander Ogurtsov said that Kononov intended to continue his bid to quash the verdict, possibly including an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Prosecutors argued that Kononov had led an attack on a small Latvian village in 1944 and ordered the execution of nine civilians. Kononov vehemently denied the charges, saying the civilians died in the crossfire in a battle between the partisans and units backed by the occupying Germans. His case provoked strong emotions among many people from Latvia's large ethnic-Russian community, with many saying Kononov was a hero who was merely fighting to liberate Latvia from the Nazis. Latvia was independent before being occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. After the 1941-44 Nazi occupation, Soviet troops occupied Latvia again, remaining there until the Baltic state regained independence following the Soviet Union's collapse. The Riga regional court found Kononov guilty of war crimes in April 2000 and sentenced him to six years in jail, but Kononov successfully appealed this sentence and the Supreme Court ordered a re-trial.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The United Nations and the International Criminal Court signed Monday an agreement allowing the court to use UN resources in pursuing war crime cases. "This agreement is very important," UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said. He called the court "an essential part of my work during the rest of my tenure." The agreement is the legal basis for the two organizations' cooperation. It was signed by Annan and Canadian judge Philippe Kirsch, president of the court, the first permanent tribunal for war crimes, in a ceremony at UN headquarters in New York City. The agreement also gives the ICC observer status at the UN General Assembly, as well as access to UN funding, UN programs, offices, information and legal assistance. Most important for the court is the cooperation of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the High Commissioner for Refugees, the special council for the prevention of genocide and UNICEF. UN peacekeepers and humanitarian missions in conflict areas will likely provide the court with information. The agreement also allows the United Nations to appear as a witness before the court. Ninety-seven countries have ratified the Rome treaty, which established the court, more than one-half of UN members, but excluding the United States, which opposes the court. Court officials plan to be ready to hear cases early next year.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Crystal Palace beat 10-man London rivals Fulham 2-0 to register their first win of the season on Monday and finally move off the bottom of the Premiership. Palace, promoted last season, secured the three points with second half goals from Andy Johnson, his fifth of the campaign, and Finnish international Aki Riihilahti. Johnson could have finished the match with a hatful and his performance had manager Iain Dowie drooling especially as many had predicted that the striker would struggle in the top flight. "Andy Johnson is quick, brave and strong and he will get goals," said Dowie. "Outside of the top four strikers in the Premiership, I rate him up there as one of the best. He's got five goals for us now and he is doing a terrific job." However, Palace's task at Selhurst Park was made easier when Fulham had defender Ian Pearce sent off after just six minutes for a clumsy lunge on Johnson after the Palace striker had sped away from him. With Pearce the last defender, referee Mike Riley no choice to reach for the red card. Chris Coleman's team were already handicapped by the absence of Andy Cole and Papa Bouba Diop who had been sent-off in the game against West Brom and were subsequently suspended. But Palace, without a point at home all season before Monday's game, were unable to take advantage and Johnson squandered a hatful of chances to put his side ahead in the first half. His worst miss was when he headed miserably wide from close range with just goalkeeper Edwin Van Der Saar to beat. However, the pressure on a stretched Fulham defence eventually told as Palace continued to press after the break with the opening goal coming on 53 minutes. Riihilahti played a weighted pass into the path of Johnson who burst between two defenders to slot the ball through the legs of van der Saar. Riihilahti then made it 2-0 in the 69th minute when he headed in a corner to register his first goal in two years for Palace. Coleman, a former Palace player, admitted his side need to improve. "The first 45 minutes we were OK, but in the second half we made too many excuses because we were down to 10-men," said Coleman. Johnson could have had a second in the 85th minute when he was clean through on goal but skewered his drive past the post while Ecuador international Ivan Kaviedes, on as a substitute, saw a right-foot shot come back off the post with four minutes left.]]></c>

But Bush and Kerry were tied 49 to 49 percent in the USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll of 772 likely voters, which had shown the president ahead by eight percentage points before the face-off.

		<t><![CDATA[Poland aims for Iraq troop pullout by end of 2005 (ADDS US reaction).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Poland said Monday that it aims to withdraw all of its 2,500 troops from Iraq during the course of next year, a major disappointment for Washington which sees Warsaw as one of its staunchest allies in Iraq. Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said after talks in Paris that no firm date to complete the withdrawal had been decided yet, but that Poland hoped "to finish our mission at the end of 2005." Poland is the fourth largest troop contributor to the US-led coalition in Iraq, but there is strong popular opposition at home to the deployment. Kwasniewski's remarks here after talks with French President Jacques Chirac followed confusion in Warsaw, where the defence minister announced the troop withdrawal only to be contradicted by other top government figures. The president said the situation in Iraq would be different after January, when general elections are to take place, supposedly the last step in setting up a legitimate Iraqi government. "That is the reason why we decided to speak with the Iraqis and with our coalition partners, the United States, about a reduction of the Polish forces from January 1 and maybe to finish our mission at the end of 2005," he said. Asked if there was a firm date, he replied: "No, this is not decided." Defense Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski in Warsaw had already announced in newspaper and radio interviews that Poland would withdraw its 2,500 troops from the country by the end of December 2005. But as the issue provoked controversy, he later clarified his comments made in interviews with Polish public radio and daily Gazeta Wyborcza, saying they reflected his "personal view". Foreign Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz distanced himself from the defence minister's statement, saying Poland did not want to "betray its ally" the United States. And in a sign of the extreme sensitivity of the issue, Prime Minister Marek Belka said he had not been consulted and would seek clarification from Szmajdzinski, the PAP news agency reported. Until now the Polish government had only said it would reduce its military presence in Iraq in 2005. Analysts noted that the centre-left government faces heavy domestic criticism over the Polish military presence in Iraq ahead of elections next year. But a planned pullout by Poland will spark dismay in Washington, where US President George W. Bush is under criticism over the troubled US-led occupation of Iraq as he seeks re-election next month. "The Bush administration is of course going to be disappointed," political analyst Krzysztof Bobinski told AFP. In last week's TV debate with Democratic challenger John Kerry, Bush specifically mentioned the Polish contribution. However the United States Monday downplayed the Polish comments, saying Warsaw's commitment to the US-led coalition was not "calendar driven." "Throughout our dealings with our coalition partners, our approach to the (foreign military) presence in Iraq has been that decisions on the presence will be driven by the mission and not by the calendar," deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said. "Once that mission is accomplished, the presence of foreign troops can begin to be reduced," he told reporters. "But that will be determined when the mission is accomplished and not on the basis of a calendar date." Poland sent 2,500 troops to Iraq last year in the wake of the US-led invasion and heads up a multinational division of 6,000 soldiers in south-central Iraq. But the intervention has proven costly. Seventeen Polish nationals have died in Iraq -- 13 soldiers and four civilians -- including three soldiers killed in an attack last month near the central Iraqi city of Hilla. According to the latest poll, more than 70 percent of Poles are opposed to the presence of their country's troops in Iraq. Parliamentary elections are due next year in Poland, with the ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) party which sent Polish troops to Iraq currently credited with only seven percent support. Moreover, its minority coalition partner, the Labour Union (UP), has threatened to withhold its support from prime minister Belka's government in a no confidence motion on October 15 unless it gives a firm timetable for an Iraqi pullout. "The reason is we have elections coming up next year and the SLD wants to be able to say during the election campaign this is not an issue because we are withdrawing the troops by the end of 2005," Bobinski said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[CLIVE, Iowa, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush and Democratic rival John Kerry battled Monday over science, taxes and Iraq, as the spotlight of their newly tight race shifted to their running mates' only televised debate. After signing legislation extending popular tax cuts, Bush said in the key up-for-grabs state of Iowa that Kerry would raise taxes on the US middle class and warned that his foreign policy would be "dangerous for world peace." Wooing voters in the battleground state of New Hampshire, Kerry accused Bush of choosing to "sacrifice science for extreme right-wing ideology" by restricting the use of government funds for stem-cell research. The two candidates, next scheduled to face off in person on Friday, sized up polls showing Kerry clawing even with the Republican on the strength of his showing Thursday in their first of three televised debates. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll had the two men tied at 49 percent among likely voters, wiping out an eight-point Bush advantage. A Newsweek magazine survey gave Kerry a three-point edge among registered voters. Bush, who lost Iowa by a hair in 2000, has a razor-thin edge there. Kerry and the president look tied in New Hampshire, which narrowly went to Bush in 2000. Bush's tepid performance in the debate added importance to Tuesday's encounter between Vice President Dick Cheney and his Democratic counterpart, Senator John Edwards, in the midwestern city of Cleveland. Commentators said Cheney would seek to repair the damage from Kerry's relentless attacks on the Iraq war and renew the focus on Bush's leadership after the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes. Edwards was likely to use his skills as a trial lawyer to skewer Cheney as the architect of the administration's security policies, which led to windfall reconstruction contracts for his a company he formerly ran, Halliburton. With the November 2 election closing fast, the president and the challenger were to square off Friday in the second of their three debates in the midwestern city of St. Louis, Missouri. The Kerry campaign kept up the pressure Monday, publishing a list of more than 180 former US ambassadors endorsing the Democrat, out of concern over the administration's foreign policy. Meanwhile, Bush redoubled his efforts to discredit Kerry as a potential commander in chief, pointing to the senator's vote against the 1991 Gulf War to oust Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. "The policies of my opponent are dangerous for world peace. If they were implemented they would make this world not more peaceful, but more dangerous," Bush told cheering supporters in Clive, Iowa. Kerry was joined in the eastern city of Hampton, New Hampshire by actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, as he blasted Bush's decision to limit publicly funded research using stem cells from human embryos. He said such studies could help find cures for diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and diabetes. "This president is making the wrong choice to sacrifice science for extreme right-wing ideology," Kerry said. Kerry, who reissued a list of 48 Nobel Prize-winning scientists who endorsed his position, said he would lift "ideologically driven" restrictions on stem cell research and fund it with at least 100 million dollars a year. Under pressure from religious groups, who see the practice as akin to abortion, Bush moved in August 2001 to bar the use of public funds for research using stem cells from human embryos after that date. But his campaign reacted harshly Monday to suggestions he had instituted an outright ban. "These characterizations are inaccurate or incomplete, and misinform the public on the reality of the policy," a statement said. And Bush himself fired back on the medical front, likening Kerry's proposals to the failed attempt to overhaul health care, lawmakers of voting 350 times for higher taxes, including increased levies on gasoline and Social Security benefits. The Kerry campaign countered by accusing the administration of doing nothing to reduce the country's dependence on Middle East oil, as costs hover near 50 dollars a barrel.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Dollar gains strongly against euro.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The dollar gained sharply against the single European currency in trading Monday after the weekend's meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers produced no surprises, traders said. The single European currency fell to 1.2283 dollars at 2100 GMT Monday from 1.2411 dollars late Friday in New York. The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen, climbing to 110.96 yen from 110.52 late Friday. The US currency gained as traders digested the weekend G7 meeting and said it yielded few surprises. "With the G7 statement being broadly unchanged compared to the wording set out in February's Boca Raton meeting, the dollar has staged a minor relief rally against the major currencies," said ABN Amro analyst Paul Mackel. "With G7 event risk having now passed, we expect the market to re-direct its attention back towards the dollar's fundamentals." The G7 statement reaffirmed that exchange rates should reflect fundamentals and reiterated that high oil prices pose a risk to the global economy. "The dollar is clawing back ground following a (G7) meeting which offered nothing new," said Clyde Wardle, an analyst at HSBC in London. Wall Street's higher close Monday and an upbeat US economic forecast also lent the dollar some support. A National Association of Business Economists panel determined the US economy will grow solidly in 2005 no matter whether President George W. Bush or Democratic rival John Kerry is in the White House. The panel forecast gross domestic product -- total economic output -- was expected to grow 3.7 percent in 2005 after a 4.3-percent expansion in 2004, despite rocketing oil prices. However, an unexpected fall in US-made factory goods in August, on plunging demand for civilian aircraft, slightly tarnished the outlook. Orders in August fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said, defying widespread predictions by economists for a gain of 0.1 percent and partially reversing a 1.7-percent surge in July. In late New York trade, the dollar was changing hands at 1.2645 Swiss francs against 1.2495 Friday. The British pound was at 1.7839 dollars from 1.7991 late Friday.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[CIA's new number three withdraws following report of past misconduct.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A close associate of new CIA director Porter Goss turned down a position as the spy agency's executive director Monday -- but agreed to be a senior adviser -- following reports he had left the CIA under a cloud in the 1980s over a shoplifting charge. Michael Kostiw, who was quietly named to the agency's number three position last week, said in a statement he decided he could not accept it because of "recent press articles and attendant speculation." "Allegations about my past would be a distraction from the critical work the director of central intelligence needs to focus on, as well as a distraction from the war on terrorism and the other national security challenges being addressed every day by the extraordinarily talented and dedicated men and women of CIA," he said in a statement. The Washington Post reported Sunday that Kostiw, who served as a case officer for 10 years, resigned under pressure from the CIA in 1982. The Post, citing sources familiar with the events, said Kostiw was caught shoplifting in Langley, Virginia. He was put on administrative leave for several weeks because of answers he gave on a polygraph test, according to the report. He told friends he decided to resign, the report said. One official told the Post that the CIA arranged for misdemeanor charges to be dropped and Kostiw record to be expunged in return for his resignation and an agreement to get counseling. Kostiw did not address the allegations, and CIA officials declined to comment. A US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Kostiw had taken and passed all the security clearance tests required to work at the CIA and that Monday was his first day. It was not immediately known what his duties would be as a senior advisor to Goss, who became director of the CIA on September 24 with a mandate to carry out reforms in the face of the massive intelligence failures on Iraq and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. A former Florida congressman, Goss chaired the House Intelligence Committee, and brought with him to CIA four former committee staffers, including Kostiw. Kostiw, who also worked as a lobbyist for Chevrong Texaco, was to have replaced AB "Buzzy" Krongard, an appointee of former CIA director George Tenet. Krongard resigned last week and there is now no known replacement for him. The executive director traditionally has run the day-to-day operations of the CIA, freeing the director to attend to the larger US intelligence community, which consists 15 agencies of varying sizes and responsibilities. In bringing in a team loyal to him, Goss appeared to be positioning himself to grasp the reins of a proud and insular bureaucracy. As senior adviser for operations and analysis, he named Jay Jakub, a former congressional staffer who helped write a report critical of US human intelligence operations. He named Merrell Moorhead senior advisor for strategic programs, which would encompass the activities of other agencies that collect information through technical means such as satellites that gather imagery or intercept communications.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[US Supreme Court rejects appeal in Ten Commandments case.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BIRMINGHAM, Alabama, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The US Supreme Court rejected Monday the final appeal from Roy Moore, the justice ousted last year from the Alabama state Supreme Court for defying an federal order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse. Moore was removed from the bench in November after a protracted dispute over the 2.5 tonne granite monument that sparked a nationwide debate on the separation of church and state. The US Supreme Court's decision to reject Moore's appeal ends a three-year legal battle over the monument that he had secretly installed in the middle of the night in the rotunda of the state courthouse. Moore, who had argued that the monument symbolized the Judeo-Christian foundation of US law, remained defiant despite his loss. "I have no regrets. I have kept my oath and my promise to the people of the state of Alabama," he said in a statement issued by his office here. "I've obeyed the rule of law by not following the unlawful dictates of man." Moore's attorney, Philip Jauregui, said he was disappointed by the decision. "To me it's the type of case they should have taken because it involved the removal of the highest elected officer of the Alabama judicial branch," he said. "We have nowhere else to go with this case. It's over." Larry Darby, of the Atheist Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, praised the court's decision. "The Supreme Court made the right decision. It's time for him to give this up and let's move on," he said. Moore was sacked by the State Court of the Judiciary, which ruled unanimously in November that the conservative judge had violated judicial ethics by rejecting a federal court order to remove the monument. A federal judge had declared in August 2003 that the monument was unconstitutional as it endorsed religion. Hundreds of supporters came to the courthouse to try to prevent the monument from being removed, which had been paid for with private donations.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MONTREAL, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Members of the radical movement Hamas are probably on the payroll of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), the agency's chief told Canadian television, adding that he does not consider such employment a crime. UNRWA chief Peter Hansen's comments came amid a mounting controversy over Israeli allegations that Palestinian militants used UNRWA ambulances to transport weapons in the Gaza Strip. Israel on Sunday said the UNRWA supports Hamas and demanded that the United Nations investigate the agency and Hansen, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) television reported Monday on its website. "Oh, I am sure that there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll and I don't see that as a crime," Hansen told the CBC. "Hamas as a political organization does not mean that every member is a militant and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another," he said. "We demand of our staff, whatever their political persuasion is, that they behave in accordance with UN standards and norms for neutrality," he added. The Israeli army released Saturday video footage purporting to show Palestinian militants using a UN ambulance to transport rockets in the Gaza Strip. After viewing the footage Sunday, Hansen said the blurry pictures, taken from an Israeli pilotless aircraft, showed nothing more than paramedics throwing a folded portable stretcher into the vehicle. He demanded a retraction and apology from Israel. Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Dan Gillerman, on Monday accused the UNRWA of "involvement in terrorist activities."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[More Palestinians killed in Gaza; Israel warns onslaught could last weeks.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[JABALIYA, Gaza Strip, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Twelve Palestinians and an Israeli were killed in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank on Monday as Israel's army warned its massive offensive in Gaza could last for weeks. Since Israel unleashed its military might six days ago, 77 Palestinians have been killed in the deadliest incursion into the Gaza Strip since the start of the intifada, or uprising, four years ago. Israeli chief of staff General Moshe Yaalon warned that the onslaught, aimed at establishing a buffer zone to prevent militants from firing homemade and generally inaccurate rockets at Israel, could last for weeks. "Our forces are ready to operate not just for days but for weeks," Yaalon told army radio. "In the war on terror, one does not resolve the problem in a single operation but by a series of operations and we will continue for as long as it takes." Four militants from the Islamist Hamas movement were killed in an air strike on the densely populated Jabaliya refugee camp, just before dawn. The army said the men were seen preparing to lay an explosives charge in the path of an Israeli patrol. Two more men and a 16-year-old girl were killed during gunfire in the camp, Palestinian medics said. In the evening, another Palestinian was killed by Israeli tank fire in Jabaliya and an armed Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli troops near the Kissufim border crossing point between the Gaza Strip and Israel. Violence also flared in the southern Gaza Strip where a four-year-old boy was shot dead by Israeli troops during an incursion into a village near Khan Yunis. In the West Bank, two Palestinians were killed in Ramallah during an operation by members of a special unit of the Israeli army, Palestinian hospital sources said. An Israeli was also killed during the operation and five Palestinian members of the radical Hamas group were arrested, Israeli and Palestinian sources said. Unmanned planes and helicopters were flying over Jabaliya camp on Monday, firing missiles and strafing any fighters who dared to venture out, AFP correspondents witnessed. Plumes of suffocating black smoke billowed from tires set ablaze by militants while residents gathered in the homes of the bereaved or in the large mourning tents traditionally erected for the families of the "martyrs". The International Committee of the Red Cross was distributing food and water in the hardest hit neighbourhoods, where power and water supplies had been cut off by the heavy fighting. Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath hit out at the Israeli incursion, calling it "state terrorism" which contravened the internationally-established rules of war. "A crime is being perpetrated against civilians by the Israeli occupation forces, according to the Fourth Geneva Convention," he said while visiting the wounded in Jabaliya's Kamal Udwan hospital. The operation had caused a "humanitarian disaster", he added, calling for an emergency meeting of the convention's signatories to demand that Israel respect its provisions on the treatment of civilians under occupation or in time of war. The Palestinian cabinet has declared a state of emergency in the face of the onslaught while the UN Security Council was set to debate the continuing Gaza operation at an emergency session in New York later on Monday. Several foreign governments, as well as the Red Cross, have expressed concern at the operation, while Israel's arch foe Iran accused it of "genocide". In London, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he was deeply concerned over the recent bloodshed in Gaza, telling Israel it must show restraint in military operations. And French aid group Medecins du Monde warned that the relentless operation made it difficult for rescue workers to reach the wounded and that local residents were running dangerously low on medicine and basic supplies. The United States Monday urged both Israel and the Palestinians to show "maxces to carry weapons and will ask Israel for proof to support its accusations, his spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday. However, he said the UN secretary general "has no reason whatsoever to doubt" the conclusions of Peter Hansen, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), who demanded a retraction and apology from the Israeli government. Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Dan Gillerman, Monday repeated his country's allegations against UNRWA, accusing it of involvement in "terrorist activities."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[UNITED NATIONS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[UN chief Kofi Annan will launch an investigation into Israeli allegations that Palestinian militants have used UN ambulances to carry weapons and will ask Israel for proof to support its accusations, his spokesman said Monday. However, Annan spokesman Fred Eckhard said the UN secretary general "has no reason whatsoever to doubt" the conclusions of Peter Hansen, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees who demanded a retraction and apology from the Israeli government. The Israeli army released Saturday video footage purporting to show Palestinian militants using a UN ambulance to transport rockets in the Gaza Strip. Israel has been conducting a massive and bloody incursion into the northern Gaza Strip since Tuesday aimed at preventing rocket attacks on Israeli territory. After viewing the footage Sunday, Hansen said the blurry pictures, taken by an Israeli drone, showed nothing more than paramedics throwing a folded portable stretcher into the vehicle. In a letter to Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, Hansen demanded Monday "an immediate public retraction and apology from the government of Israel." Annan met with Israel's ambassador to the UN Dan Gillerman to ask what evidence Israel has to support the allegations. Gillerman reiterated the charges, saying that he "made it very clear" to Annan that there is "a very worrying pattern of UN involvement in terrorist activities. "Too many times, has the UN found either its staff, its personnel, its vehicles or its logistics too near of terrorist activities or being used or maybe even cynically manipulated by terrorists," Gillerman told reporters after the meeting. "The mere fact that this is happening time after time after time is something which the UN should be very worried about," he said. According to Gillerman, the Israeli army "is convinced that the object that was actually put in that UN vehicle was indeed a weapon and not a stretcher." Gillerman also said it was "worrying and incredible" that Hansen said in an interview with Canadian CBC network that the UN agency employs members of the Palestinian group Hamas, and that Hansen said there was a distinction between the group's political and military wings. Canada, the United States and Europe all consider Hamas a terrorist group and reject such a distinction, Gillerman said. "For a high ranking UN official to make that allegation to us is totally unacceptable and very disturbing and should be disturbing to the UN as well," Gillerman said. Annan told Gillerman "that the UN and he personally are taking these allegations very seriously" and will send a team to investigate the charges. A UN team which will travel to Israel from New York on Tuesday, Annan spokesman Fred Eckhard said. Gillerman repeated the charges during a Security Council meeting which is considering a motion presented by Algeria, representing the Arab nations, calling on Israel to end its military offensive in the Gaza strip.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Monday welcomed the approval by Cambodian lawmakers of a plan to try surviving leaders of the ruthless Khmer Rouge regime, saying it paved the way for a UN-backed tribunal. "The Cambodian National Assembly's action is a step toward establishing a Khmer Rouge tribunal with UN support," said Tom Casey, a State Department spokesman. He said the United States "expressed its support for a credible Khmer Rouge tribunal," that would try surviving Khmer Rouge leaders for genocide more than a quarter-century after the radical communists were ousted from power. The regime was blamed for the deaths of nearly two million people. The UN and Cambodia approved the historic tribunal agreement in June 2003 after four years of negotiations. The plan approved Monday by the Cambodian legislature must still be endorsed by the Senate, the Constitutional Council and King Norodom Sihanouk, formalities which are likely to take a few weeks. Only two of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders cited by scholars for trial for committing genocide and crimes against humanity are in detention, and most are in their seventies. Khmer Rouge supremo Pol Pot died in 1998. Attention is now focused on funding, which is yet to be finalised. An initial UN estimate put the cost for three-year proceedings that will try fewer than a dozen ex-leaders at around 55 million dollars, but donors balked and the figure is still being thrashed out. Foreign Minister Hor Namhong told the assembly that UN chief Kofi Annan last week urged the government to inform the UN of the bill's passage so the global body can formally ask donors, such as Japan and France, for cash.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SANTIAGO, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Augusto Pinochet has lost nearly all his memory, said Monday a physician chosen by the former dictator's defense team to deliver a medical assessment that could determine whether the retired general stands trial. "He is much worse" than three years ago, said neurologist Sergio Ferrer. "He has deteriorated generally, now he cannot even sit." Judge Juan Guzman Tapia ordered the examination by Ferrer and two other physicians in response to defense lawyers who say Pinochet, 88, should not stand trial. Ferrer spoke after delivering his examination results to Guzman Tapia four days early. The other two physicians have until Friday to do so. Guzan Tapia wants to prosecute Pinochet on his participation in Operation Condor, a conspiracy of 1970s military dictatorships to eliminate opponents and spirit their bodies to countries in the plot: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. Guzman Tapia brought charges on behalf of families of 19 alleged victims. Although some 3,000 opponents to the regime were killed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 government, the former dictator has never faced trial, claiming to suffer a dementia that would not allow him to properly defend himself. Lawyers for Pinochet and for families of the 19 alleged victims agreed on the selection of the three psychiatrists. The doctors gave a series of tests to measure Pinochet's mental abilities and his memory of recent and past events, according to medical sources. They also took note of Pinochet's physical condition, especially diabetes and arthritis, and a heart problem requiring a pacemaker. Chile's Supreme Court backed Pinochet's claim of mental incompetence prior to a 2002 television interview in Miami, in which the former general appeared lucid and joked with his interviewer. In August, the high court revoked his immunity from prosecution, which had been granted to him as a former head of state, allowing Guzman Tapia to interrogate Pinochet. Last week, Pinochet denied any knowledge of Operation Condor. Guzman Tapia charged him in 2001 in connection with the "Caravan of Death" case," in which a band of officers roamed the country summarily executing suspected opponents shortly after the September 1973 coup that propelled Pinochet to power.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[French Finance Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, considered a possible presidential candidate in France's 2007 election, wrapped up Monday a US visit during which he tried to ease lingering tensions over France's opposition to the US-led war in Iraq. "If I am here, it's because France loves the United States," Sarkozy told students at New York's Columbia University. "Do not view the world as hostile toward the United States," said Sarkozy, who is expected to step down from the cabinet later this year to become head of the ruling Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party, a move widely considered as a step toward a presidential run. France led the opposition to the US-led war in Iraq, a position that angered US politicians and led some Americans to boycott French products. "We had a disagreement over Iraq that is part of our history," Sarkozy said. "Everyone has the right to have a position." Sarkozy traveled to the United States to attend meetings of the the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and the Group of Seven world economic powers. During his trip, he also met with US Secretary of State Colin Powell, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Asked about a link between his high-level meetings and his presidential aspirations, Sarkozy said: "You can have pleasure in seeing people, whatever your ambitions might be or whatever the future might hold. It has nothing to do with the domestic political stakes in France." He was also asked about President George W. Bush's assertion that his rival in the US presidential election, Democrat John Kerry, would give France a veto over US policy. "I believe that President Bush's declarations were aimed more toward Mr. Kerry than France," Sarkozy said. "One must differentiate between what has to do with the election campaign and what has to do with diplomatic relations."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ASMARA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Southern Sudanese rebels warned here Monday that the only alternative to a comprehensive peace deal is "comprehensive war". Yasir Arman, spokesman for the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) made this declaration just three days ahead of the last round of peace talks in Kenya between the Sudanese government and the SPLA, during an interview with an AFP journalist. "The alternative to a comprehensive peace settlement is comprehensive war," if peace talks between the SPLA and Khartoum fail, he warned in Asmara. "We prefer to finalise the peace agreement," he added. "We are hopeful that this time the government (Khartoum) will have the political will to finalise the deal." The SPLA, led by John Garang, and Khartoum are in the final stage of the Naivasha (Kenya) peace process, whose aim is to put an end to a civil war that started in 1983, and which has killed nearly one and a half million people. The peace talks are scheduled to last three days, "but the SPLA is ready to give more time to reach a final deal, and expects the same from the government". The deal "was supposed to have been finished a long time ago but the government was trying to buy time," said the SPLA spokesman. "We have resolved the substantial issues, what remains is technical." "If we reach a deal in Naivasha, it will impact positively on Darfur," in Western Sudan where rebels are currently fighting against the government. But if an agreement is not reached, "it will have very grave consequences on the Sudanese situation, and many people see that Sudan is on the verge of collapsing". Yasir Arman repeated that the SPLA has "political relations with the Darfur rebels but no military relations". Libya is to host an African mini-summit on Sudan's Darfur crisis later this month, with Chad, Egypt and Nigeria also taking part, Egyptian presidential spokesman Maged Abdel Fattah announced Monday. "The mini-summit on Darfur will be held under the auspices of Nigeria in its capacity as president of the African Union (AU)," he told reporters. A peace settlement between the SPLA and Khartoum will also be the "biggest step in the normalisation of relations between Sudan and Eritrea," Arman added. Currently, relations between Sudan and Eritrea are strained: Khartoum accuses Asmara of supporting Sudanese rebels in Darfur, a claim which the Eritrean authorities reject. Arman added that John Garang had a meeting with Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki on Friday. "President Isaias expressed his full support for a peace settlement," between the SPLA and Khartoum, insisted Arman. Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir said Sunday he was ready to sign a peace deal with southern rebels and that he did not want to govern the country alone.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto on Monday reminded the Paris fashion crowd why he is the master of proportion and shape, offering an artfully constructed collection for spring-summer 2005 with a couture feel. Yamamoto is a poetic soul with an intellectual take on fashion -- he unveiled his starkly beautiful collection in a covered market in central Paris to the strains of solo violin music, not the usual thumping dance tracks. The veteran Japanese designer experimented with structure and volume through the transformation of a simple floor-length white shirt dress, adding pleated swathes of fabric and playing with length to create multiple looks. He offered an array of suits in his cherished black, sculpting a lapel to create extra movement or varying the cut of the trousers -- from full and masculine with cuffs to form-fitting capris -- to change the silhouette. Bursts of scarlet red and hints of bottle green and pearl gray broke up the traditional black-white color scheme. A touch of beadwork in the short sleeves of a fitted jacket served as the only ornamentation in the pure collection. Yamamoto expertly wrapped his models in braids of pleated material, conjuring up backless black halter dresses and a stunning red evening gown that ended with two tight blossoms at the shoulder. The designer came full-circle with a final white shirt dress, only this time it was sheathed in black lace with tiny red flecks. Yamamoto offered a catwalk show in perfect harmony. His compatriot Jun Takahashi, a Tokyo punk rocker-turned-designer whose streetwear is coveted by fashionistas in the Japanese capital, offered a study of passing time for his Undercover line, using his fabrics to tell a story. He cut up his fabrics to make them look like chipped, flaking paintings, as with a red coat that looked as if it had long ago been used on a hunt, an errant branch jutting out from the waist. Some of Takahashi's dresses looked like they were made from fading, torn wallpaper. Others had so many baubles attached to them, or so much embroidery, that they appeared to be endless works-in-progress with years of history. On Tuesday, fashion observers will have a jam-packed day with John Galliano for Christian Dior, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Issey Miyake by Naoki Takizawa and Vivienne Westwood all on the show schedule. Ready-to-wear week runs in Paris through October 11.]]></c>

The small, handmade vessel that made history when it soared 112 kilometers (nearly 70 miles) into space on Monday is an unlikely hero of a space race once dominated by the US and Russian governments and their huge, multi-billion-dollar high-tech spaceships. The white star-spangled ship, about the size of a truck with a pointy nose and short, fat body is more reminiscent of a fantasy craft from 1930s comic book "Flash Gordon" than it is of state-of-the art technology. But aviation pioneer Burt Rutan, hailed a genius and visionary by aerospace colleagues and by such figures as Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, who stumped up the estimated 20 million dollars that SpaceShipOne cost to develop, turned his simple yet ingenious dream into reality. "If you told me when we started this project. how well it would turn out, I wouldn't have believed it," Rutan said. "It has worked much better than we could have hoped." Former US Air Force test flight engineer Rutan, who has built experimental planes since the 1970s, used simple materials and revolutionary yet uncomplicated designs to reach for the stars when he launched the SpaceShipOne project in 2001. Using a manufacture process similar to that used to make surfboards, Rutan and his innovative team based in California's harsh Mojave desert used graphite and epoxy composite to build the airframe, creating a spaceship made essentially of tough fabric and glue. The ship, which has a 4.9-meter (16-foot) wingspan and twin vertical tails, was then coated with a simple "trowel-on" ablative thermal protection layer to withstand re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Inside the double-walled pressurised three-man craft, crew do not have to wear space suits, but can wear shirt-sleeves for the short space journey that so far lasts only a few minutes. The ship is powered by a unique hybrid engine using nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, which ignites and burns into vehicle tyre rubber which explodes, propelling the ship on a vertical journey into space once it is launched from its mother plane, also a Rutan design. The gas and rubber combustion allows SpaceShipOne to travel at speeds of up to 3,500 kilometers (2,180 miles) an hour in its vertical ascent from near its mother plane into space. It then glides powerlessly back to Earth. But the most remarkable aspect of the ship, which weighs just 3,060 kilograms (6,800 pounds) compared to the 1960 X-15 space jet that weighed almost 6,700 kilograms (14,750 pounds), is its ability to transform its shape at will. The rocket's tail and wings fold, allowing it to transform into three different configurations during the ommemorate the world's first viable commercial space liner. But until then, he said, it will likely continue flying and be used to carry out further research to develop a new generation of spaceliners for British tycoon Richard Branson, who has ordered five.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' gets a Bollywood makeover.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A Bollywood version of the classic English novel "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen received its world premiere Monday, an all-singing, all-dancing affair set in India, London and Los Angeles. The 10-million-pound (14.5 million-euro, 17.8-million-dollar) movie "Bride and Prejudice" is the work of director Gurinder Chadha, who was born in Kenya but grew up in south London with her east Indian parents. Chadha said she felt intense pressure following the success of her last film "Bend It Like Beckham", a comedy about an Asian girl who takes a fancy to football while trying to balance it with her parents demands. "Bend it Like Beckham", borrowing the surname of England football captain David Beckham, became a smash hit and one of the highest grossing British-produced films of 2002, despite being made for only two million pounds. "There was an extreme amount of pressure to deliver something that people will really like," she told Britain's domestic Press Association news agency at the premiere wearing a cream sari. "I think the most important thing about making a film is that you're happy with it," she said. "It's not a masterpiece, but it is a lot of fun." Like Austen's book, "Bride and Prejudice" tells the story of a lower middle-class family's attempt to marry off its daughter to men of a higher social standing. "It's very true to Jane Austen and the spirit of the book, and I think if she came down and went to see it in her local Odeon, she would like it," Chadha said. Austen's heroine Elizabeth Bennet becomes Lalita Bakshi in the film, and is played by Aishwarya Rai, a former Miss World and Bollywood's most sought after actress. Darcy, the male lead, is played by Martin Henderson, a Los Angeles-based actor from New Zealand. "This is so exciting," Rai told the Press Association, at the premiere in London's West End, wearing a glittering green and black glittering dress from Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani. "I've had a wonderful welcome from the crowd out there," she said. "It's fantastic to be in London, and I loved making this movie." Chadha has been hand-picked by studio bosses in the United States for her next project, a big budget adventure sequel to the popular American sitcom from the 1960s "I Dream of Jeannie". "Bride and Prejudice" is released in Britain on Friday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[AUCKLAND, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[One of seven men facing sex charges on the remote British Pacific colony of Pitcairn Island pleaded guilty Monday in abuse trials implicating more than half the island's adult men, Radio New Zealand reported. Island postmaster Dennis Christian, 49, pleaded guilty to three of the four charges he faced. The fourth charge was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence. RNZ said Christian admitted indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl in the early 1980s. The details of the two other charges were suppressed. Pitcairn, a tiny island halfway between New Zealand and South America, has a resident population of 47, now nearly doubled with three New Zealand judges and court staff holding a series of trials in the previous dormant Court of Pitcairn. Seven of the island's 12 adult men are charged with a total of 55 sex crimes, some dating back 40 years. Three other trials are already under way with Len Brown, 78, on two charges of rape; his son, Dave Brown, 49, on 15 sexual abuse charges, including assault of a five-year-old; and the island's mayor, Steven Christian, 53, on trial on six charges of rape and four of indecent assault. The island marks Saturday as its Sabbath and so the courts sat on Sunday. In Steve Christian's trial, police read out in court a statement Sunday from the second of the two alleged rape victims. "Steve seemed to take it upon himself to initiate all of the girls on the island. It was like we were his harem," the statement said. Pitcairn was uninhabited until mate Fletcher Christian aboard the Royal Navy ship HMS Bounty led a mutiny on April 28, 1789 against Captain William Bligh, who was set adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Eight mutineers along with six Tahitian men, 12 Tahitian women and a small girl then searched the South Seas for a haven, reaching uninhabited Pitcairn on January 15, 1790. Six other island men charged with sex crimes have yet to be extradited from Australia and New Zealand.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Democrat John Kerry was a clear winner in last week's presidential debate against George W. Bush but opinion was mixed whether his success translated into votes, according to a flurry of new polls released Monday. Two polls showed Bush clinging to a modest lead after Thursday's televised encounter, but three others called the race a virtual dead heat less than a month before the November 2 election. A Pew Research Center survey found that viewers thought Kerry won Thursday's debate by a two-to-one margin, but Bush had a 48-41 percent lead among registered voters in the overall race. The margin was 49-44 percent among likely voters. The same split turned up in an ABC News/Washington Post poll which found that although two in three likely voters felt Kerry won the debate, he trailed the president 46-51 percent in the wider contest. But a Gallup/USA Today/CNN had Kerry moving up to a tie among likely voters at 49 percent each. A CBS News/New York Times poll called it a 47-47 percent draw and a Zogby survey had Bush ahead by a statistically insignificant point. Over the weekend, Newsweek magazine gave Kerry a three-point edge at 49-46 percent and the Los Angeles Times had the Massachusetts senator leading 49-47 percent, both findings within the margin of error. Most of the polls showed the Democrat making headway in his battle to overcome damaging Republican portrayals of him as weak and vacillating on defense and unfit for command in the war on terror. The Newsweek poll showed him cutting Bush's lead on Iraq from 15 to five points, and on the war on terror from 24 to 12 points. The Gallup poll had Kerry trimming his deficit on Iraq from 14 to seven points and on terrorism from 27 to 17 points. The Los Angeles Times had Kerry wiping out Bush's three-point advantage on Iraq and cutting the lead on terrorism from 14 to 10 points. ABC said Bush retained hefty leads on security issues and leadership, but it had good news for Kerry elsewhere. It said the number of likely voters with a favorable opinion of Kerry rose eight points to 47 percent. And if the number who said Bush had no clear plan for Iraq rose six points to 48 percent, the percentage who said Kerry had a clear strategy rose five points to 42 percent. At the same time, Kerry opened up a 13-point lead over Bush on the economy, according to Newsweek, which previously had the two men tied, and the Los Angeles Times, which had Bush leading by six points 10 days ago. Kerry has a 22-point lead on health care, up from 10 points three weeks ago, Newsweek said. The Pew poll, however, showed no gain for Kerry on the security front as the candidates geared for two more debates in the next nine days and their vice presidential running-mates prepared to slug it out Tuesday. Pew put Bush's lead on Iraq at 10 points, up from eight points two weeks ago, and on terrorism at 25 points, an advance of one point. Kerry's argument that Bush made major misjudgments on Iraq and the war on terrorism seems to have yet to strike a major chord. Forty-six percent of voters said they agreed, but 50 percent disagreed. A majority also rejected another of Kerry's lines of attack, that the president was too inflexible on foreign policy. And nearly half thought Kerry changed his mind too much to be a good commander in chief. The Pew data suggested much of the Democrat's support was still soft. Fifty-six percent said they were more anti-Bush than pro-Kerry, although the figure was down from 61 percent three weeks ago.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Support for Prime Minister Tony Blair's policy of keeping British troops in Iraq until a "stable democracy" is ensured has increased over the past three months, according to an opinion poll published Tuesday. The Populus poll in the Times newspaper said that 49 percent of those surveyed want Britain's 9,000 troops to stay until Iraq is stable, as opposed to 42 percent who want them to withdraw as soon as possible. In a similar poll in July 42 percent wanted British troops to stay while 51 percent wanted them out. Populus also asked 1,004 people over the weekend whether taking military action in iraq had been right or wrong. Thirty-three percent said it was the correct policy, while 53 percent viewed it as wrong, showing a growing scepticism of Blair's original war policy. In the first poll such poll, held in June 1993, 58 percent said going into Iraq was the right thing to do, with only 34 percent opposing military action. In October 2003 41 percent were for the war and 50 percent were against.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Rumsfeld says more Samarra-like offensives needed to clear out safe havens (INCORPORATES US-Iraq-Rumsfeld-Samarra).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld raised the prospect Monday that US and Iraqi forces will launch more offensives to clear safe havens of insurgents like the one just completed in the city of Samarra. Speaking to foreign policy experts here, Rumsfeld expressed confidence the United States would win a bloody test of wills with the insurgents but admitted that the cost in US and Iraqi lives has been high. "It is often, on some bad days, not a pretty picture at all. In fact, it can be dangerous and ugly," he said. He insisted, however, "Failure in Afghanistan or Iraq would exact a terrible toll. It would embolden the extremists and make the world a far more dangerous place." Rumsfeld's appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations came as Iraq emerged as the dominating issue of the US presidential campaign, shrinking President George W. Bush's lead in the polls. To the question of how to win the struggle in Iraq, Rumsfeld pointed to the recently completed offensive by US and Iraqi forces to retake the city of Samarra, which has been held by insurgents since June. At least 150 people, including an unknown number of civilians, were killed and scores wounded in two days of fighting there. "What has to be done in that country is what happened in Samarra over the last 48 hours," Rumsfeld said. "You cannot allow a series of safe havens or a consistent pattern of misbehavior, anti-social behavior, violence against the government of Iraq to go on over a sustained period of time," he said. "You can't allow that, or you don't have a country, or people don't feel they have a stake in it," he said. Rumsfeld said diplomacy backed by the threat of force was the preferred means to regain cities controlled by the insurgents, but it had not always worked. "Finally you may have to use force, and that's what happened," he said. "My guess is that's what you'll see in Iraq -- the government systematically deciding they are not going to accept the idea of safe havens, and foreign terrorists, and former regime elements running around threatening and killing people," he said. Asked how elections can be held in January if major cities are not subdued, Rumsfeld said the Iraqi government would decide what to do. "What judgments the Iraqi government would make at any given time is entirely up to them, not me, not the United States and not the coalition," he said. Rumsfeld made waves last month by suggesting that elections may be held only in parts of the country that are secure. He accused neighboring Iran of sending money and arms into the country to influence the outcome of the elections, and said Syria also has facilitated the movement of "terrorists" and money across its borders. He said it was too soon to tell whether an agreement by Damascus to tight control its borders would lead to a change. A theme Rumsfeld returned to often was that Afghanistan and Iraq were battlefields in a larger struggle between extremists and moderates in the Muslim world. The insurgents' goal, he said, "is to flip the governments in that part of the world, one after another, and to take them over and re-establish a caliphate." "They are convinced that if they can win the battle of perceptions -- and they're very good at managing perceptions -- that we will lose our will and toss it in. I believe they're wrong," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[UNITED NATIONS, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The UN Security Council on Monday discussed the Middle East after Algeria submitted a draft resolution calling on Israel to withdraw its forces from Gaza, but the United States quickly criticized the measure. The draft, presented by Arab nations and up for a vote Tuesday, was introduced amid a massive Israeli incursion in the Gaza Strip that was launched six days ago to establish a buffer zone that would prevent militants from firing rockets at Israel. Since the start of the campaign, 77 Palestinians have been killed. The proposed resolution "demands the immediate cessation of all military operations in the area of Northern Gaza and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces from that area." US ambassador John Danforth dismissed the text as "one more step on the road to nowhere." "The Security Council and the General Assembly, instead of saying 'stop' to both sides, act as the cheerleaders of the Palestinians," Danforth said. Dutch ambassador Dirk van den Berg, who spoke for the European Union, said Israel's response to Palestinian attacks was "disproportionate." "Though Israel has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, the exercise of this right should take place within the boundaries of international law," he said. Algerian ambassador Abdallah Baali denounced "the disgraceful methods used by Israel today against defenseless civilian populations." The council must "demand that Israel put an end immediately to the operations it is carrying out in Gaza," Baali said. The Algerian text calls on Israel and the Palestinian Authority "to immediately implement their obligations under the roadmap" for peace backed by the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and Russia. The text also "calls on Israel, the occupying power, to ensure the unfettered access and safety of United Nations personnel. and calls for the respect of the inviolability of the facilities of the United Nations agencies in the field, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East." The agency came under fire from Israel, which claimed that it allowed an ambulance to be abused by Palestinian militants to carry weapons. The head of the agency, Peter Hansen, called the Israeli charges "malicious propaganda" that endangered the lives of UN staff and demanded a retraction and an apology. Israel's UN ambassador Dan Gillerman said he "made it very clear" to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan Monday that there is "a very worrying pattern of UN involvement in terrorist activities."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAN JOSE, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Costa Rican President Abel Pacheco on Monday demanded that Organization of American States Secretary General Miguel Angel Rodriguez resign and face corruption charges over an alleged bribe from French telecom Alcatel. "I ask you to leave the post as secretary general and return to Costa Rica to face your responsibilities," Pacheco said in a letter to Rodriguez. In Washington, Rodriguez, on the job for two weeks, brushed off Pacheco's demand. "It is impossible, in the Costa Rica that I know, to cause great damage to me, my family, and the institution I now represent by disrespecting my (presumed) innocence." Rodriguez served as Costa Rica's president from 1998 to 2002, and was succeeded by Pacheco. Honduran President Ricardo Maduro on Monday demanded Rodriguez explain himself, while Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Norman Caldera said that the OAS was in crisis. Costa Rican media reported Thursday that Rodriguez had received transfers from bank accounts of the wife of a leading suspect in the scandal, Jose Antonio Lobo. Lobo is the former director of the state-run Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and told investigators Thursday that Rodriguez had demanded a 60 percent portion of a kick-back Alcatel paid after it won a license for 400,000 cellular telephone lines in 2001. The kick-back represented 1.5 percent, or two million dollars, of Alcatel's payment for the license, said Lobo, who for 20 years was part of Rodriguez's Christian Social Unity Party. In an interview with Costa Rica's Canal 7 television, Rodriguez said in Washington that the money he received from Lobo was a loan to defray the costs of his campaign to head the OAS. "This is part of a total of 140,000 dollars that Jose Antonio Lobo lent me," he said. On Monday, Rodriguez called a meeting of ambassadors accredited to the OAS to explain the corruption allegations, but did not mention the possibility of resigning. On the weekend, Rodriguez enjoyed the backing of politicians, business and labor leaders, while Costa Rican legislators demanded Rodriguez resign the OAS post. Pacheco said that if Rodriguez does not resign, Costa Rica would, as an OAS member, seek his removal. Costa Rica's electricity company enjoys a monopoly over telecommunications, and has in three years paid Alcatel 258 million dollars. Rodriguez, in his brief time heading the OAS, has slashed salaries, including his own, by 10 percent and converted the multilateral organization's 22 departments into seven to meet anticipated budget shortfalls.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA['Shark Tale' dominates North American box office, but fails at record bid.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The animated movie "Shark Tale" week swam circles around the competition over the weekend in North America, but failed to set a record for the best October opening ever as movie studio DreamWorks had hoped, final figures showed Monday. The movie, about a vegetarian shark and his undersea friends, grossed 47.6 million dollars over the weekend, according to box office-trackers Exhibitor Relations. That means the record is still held by the 48.1 million dollars the comedy "Scary Movie 3" generated in its October 2003 debut. The movie however did become the fifth best animated opening of all time, behind mid-year's "Shrek 2," last year's "Finding Nemo," "Monsters, Inc." and "Toy Story 2." In second place was "Ladder 49," a John Travolta fire rescue film heavy on heroism that grossed 22 million dollars in its debut. It was followed by "The Forgotten," a thriller starring Julianne Moore as a grieving mother who fears she is losing her sanity, which grossed 11.8 million dollars. Fourth was the retro-futuristic "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" starring Jude Law, Gwenneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, which grossed 3.2 million dollars. Baseball comedy "Mr. 3000," starring Bernie Mac as a retired star who returns to the game after his career legend is damaged, pulled in 2.5 million dollars. Rounding off the bottom five was the British zombie comedy "Shaun of the Dead" (2.4 million dollars), the death row drama "Woman Thou Art Loosed" (2.32 million dollars), the video game-inspired "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" (2.31 million dollars), the romantic comedy "First Daughter" (2.1 million dollars) and the thriller "Cellular" (2 million dollars). The weekend's top 12 films grossed an estimated 101.7 million dollars for the weekend, far ahead of the same weekend last year when the top 12 took in a combined 80.5 million dollars.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Crystal Palace boss Iain Dowie hailed Andy Johnson as one of the best strikers in the country after the centre-forward scored his fifth goal of the season in a 2-0 win against Fulham on Monday. The victory, Palace's first in the Premiership this season, also lifted the Londoners off the foot of the table. "When you're quick, when you're strong, you're brave and your movement's very good then you're going to get goals," said Dowie. "I rate him among the best in the Premiership, outside three or four." Johnson opened the soring in the 53rd minute at Selhurst Park before Finnish international Aki Riihilahti added the second on 69 minutes. However, Palace's task was made easier when Fulham had defender Ian Pearce sent off after just six minutes for a clumsy lunge on Johnson. With Pearce the last defender, referee Mike Riley no choice to reach for the red card. "It's pleasing just to get three points and get off the bottom. We got a great result and the boys really deserved it," said Johnson. Fulham manager Chris Coleman, a former Palace player, admitted his side need to improve. "I can't make excuses because we only had 10 men. We consistently made the wrong decisions throughout the game. Our pass selection was poor," said Coleman. "I honestly thought the longer it went on, we were okay but then Johnson got the goal and it was an uphill battle for us. They could have scored more." Johnson could have had a second in the 85th minute when he was clean through on goal but skewered his drive past the post while Ecuador international Ivan Kaviedes, on as a substitute, saw a right-foot shot come back off the post with four minutes left.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Owen and Henry under World Cup pressure by Dave James.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[European heavyweights England and France resume their World Cup qualifying campaign on Saturday with serious concerns over the goal-scoring potency of two of the world's deadliest hitmen. Although Michael Owen and Thierry Henry are feared by most self-respecting defences and have the public backing of their coaches, both know they need to rediscover their scoring touch - or else. Owen, whose summer move from Liverpool to Real Madrid is rapidly turning into a nightmare, gets his chance to restore his reputation on Saturday when England play Wales in Manchester as he looks to add to his 27 goals. Arsenal striker Henry, meanwhile, leads the French against the Republic of Ireland stuck on 27 goals and having found the net just twice in his last 10 outings. Should they fail to impress, England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson and French boss Raymond Domenech have the luxury of calling up the cavalry in the second installment of double-headers with England travelling to Azerbaijan and France heading for Cyprus on the following Wednesday. Owen, replaced in Real Madrid's latest defeat against Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday and now reported to have suffered a "slight muscle strain", should start alongside wonderboy Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford against the Welsh on Saturday. But waiting in the wings is Tottenham's Jermain Defoe who scored his first England goal in the win in Poland last month. "Michael is mentally very strong. He has always been the man for the big games and although he might sometimes not play to his best, he will still score goals for you," said Eriksson. "It's not good for him, me or England if he plays too little football with Real Madrid at the moment. It's tough for him. He's never been used to sitting on the bench, not for Liverpool or England." Asked if Defoe had a genuine chance of playing against Wales, Eriksson insisted: "Of course." England are second in Group Six on goal difference behind Austria. France are third in Group Four but have the same points (4) as Switzerland and the Republic of Ireland and face the Irish in Paris on Saturday. All eyes will be on Henry especially with a serious doubt over strike partner David Trezeguet who is injured. "Thierry is going through a bad phase with the national team," said coach Domenech. "It's a problem which will be settled. But Thierry isn't indispensable. He is not the only scorer." Another striker looking to improve is Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy who hopes recently-installed Dutch national coach Marco van Basten can add more edge to his game. He will get his chance when the Dutch face Macedonia on Saturday before a home clash against Finland in Amsterdam next Wednesday in Group One. Romania lead that group with a maximum nine points from three matches while the Dutch also face competition from the Czech Republic for the sole qualifying spot for the finals in Germany in 2006. "I don't think I know everything and don't feel too big to ignore advice, especially when it comes from someone like him," said van Nistelrooy who missed the win against the Czechs last month because of injury. "When I was a kid, I thought an awful lot of him. He was my idol, now he is going to be my manager. It's weird I suppose but I'm really happy it has happened." Italy, who lead Group Five with six points from two games, travel to Slovenia on Saturday before entertaining Belarus in Parma next Wednesday, have recalled Francesco Totti, another man with plenty to prove. The 28-year-old striker was banned for three matches for spitting at Danish defender Christian Poulsen at Euro 2004 and his recall is timely as coach Marcello Lippi is without Alessandro Del Piero and Christian Vieri because of injuries. "I considered quitting the national side, but then I realised that would have been a victory for my critics win," said Totti. "Ive now forgotten about it. I know that I made a mistake but I didnt do it on purpose. It was a reaction, a spontaneous gesture." The forthcoming double-headers could also be make-or-break for Spain and Greece. The Spaniards, bristling with talent, were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw in their Group Seven opener by Bosnia and face Belgium in Santander on Saturday before a tricky trip to Lithuania on Wednesday. But it is Greece, European champions just four months ago, who have the biggest headache of all with just a point from their two games in Group Two and who go to joint group leaders Ukraine on Saturday. Otto Rehhagel's team have lost 2-1 to Albania and drawn 1-1 with Turkey but the Greeks are not ready to panic. "We have had a poor beginning. We do not seem ready and need more matches to play," said striker Zisis Vryzas. "But we will not give up. In our next match we will give all our strength so that we can qualify for the World Cup."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WOLFSBURG, Germany, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[VfL Wolfsburg refused to budge from top spot in the Bundesliga collecting 18 points from a possible 21 to stand proudly above Bayern Munich and other German big guns. The unfashionable club only won promotion to the Bundesliga seven years ago but have made remarkable progress and now lead the 18-strong Bundesliga pack thanks to six wins in seven matches. Borussia Monchengladbach became their latest victims on Saturday falling to a 2-1 defeat at the Volkswagen Arena. "I have never claimed that we could be German champions," said coach Erik Gerets. "If we do not raise our game we will not even be able to stay near the top for the next two months." VfL Wolfsburg won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1997 alongside Kaiserslautern but while the Wolves struggled Kaiserslautern, under the guidance of Greece's Euro 2004 managerial hero Otto Rehhagel, stormed to the German title. It was a fairytale to push Bayern Munich into second spot after winning promotion the previous season and Wolfsburg dream of their own fairytale. "We dream about the title but we know that we are not good enough to win it," added Belgian handler Gerets. Wolfsburg used to be famous for having a coach named Wolfgang Wolf and Peter Pander as their general manager but, bankrolled by car giant Volkwagen, they are starting to motor on the pitch. The unfashionable German side fended off real competition to snap up Argentine playmaker Andres D'Alessandro from River Plate in 2003 and it has helped bring the club forward. An Olympic Games winner with Argentina in 2004, D'Alessandro cost a club record nine million euros but his quality has shone through and he appears to breed confidence in other players. Dutch international Kevin Hofland, once targeted by Manchester United and Arsenal, was signed for two million euros from PSV Eindhoven in the close season and has been a revelation in defence. Argentine striker Diego Klimowicz, German international striker Thomas Brdaric and goalkeeper Simon Jentzsch are other players to blossom under Gerets. Unlike Bayern, Werder Bremen, Bayer Leverkusen and VfB Stuttgart, who are all distracted by playing in Europe, Wolfsburg can give their full attention to the Bundesliga and will hope that gives them an edge. Qualifying for Europe was the aim in pre-season but Wolves fans are crossing their fingers that the Kaiserslautern spirit of 1998 can be recreated at the Volkswagen Arena.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[DETROIT, Michigan, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Incentives may boost US Big Three auto sales, but a study of perceived value released Monday suggests that hefty cash-back deals jeopardize Detroit's image in the long run. The Total Value Index is an annual look at whed in the near-luxury SUV and luxury SUV categories, its Lexus LS430 garnering honors as the top luxury car. And the SC430 tied with Cadillac's new XLR as most valued convertible priced over 30,000 dollars. The new study is the latest to suggest that incentives are actually hurting, rather than helping Detroit's image. "While incentives may move cars out of dealer showrooms, they don't necessarily mean greater value to new vehicle buyers," Gorrell emphasized. In fact, many consumers have come to see rebates and other cash-back deals as little more than a shell game. "People think they're just putting prices back to where they should have been in the first place," cautioned Gorrell. But Detroit should not be written off entirely, he cautioned, no more than Hyundai once was. The South Korean carmaker led or tied in three of the 2004 TVI categories, including small SUV, where it scored with the best-rated Santa Fe. It was not all that long ago, Gorrell noted, that Hyundai was at the rear of the pack in perceived value, as quality problems more than offset rock-bottom prices. Low prices continue to be the foundation of Hyundai's appeal, but its image, said Gorrell, has been shored up by a 10-year warranty program on products that are surprising and delighting customers. "Hyundai is on a roll," said Gorrell. "The great product execution is resonating with buyers." But he stressed that perception often lags reality. "It takes a long time to get that news out, so the brand is still sitting out there with low levels of consideration because of residual concerns" about Hyundai's past quality problems.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Support for Prime Minister Tony Blair's policy of keeping British troops in Iraq until a "stable democracy" is ensured has increased over the past three months, according to an opinion poll published Tuesday. The Populus poll in the Times newspaper said that 49 percent of those surveyed want Britain's 9,000 troops to stay until Iraq is stable, as opposed to 42 percent who want them to withdraw as soon as possible. In a similar poll in July 42 percent wanted British troops to stay while 51 percent wanted them out. Populus also asked 1,004 people over the weekend whether taking military action in Iraq had been right or wrong. Thirty-three percent said it was the correct policy, while 53 percent viewed it as wrong, showing a growing scepticism of Blair's original war policy. In the first such poll, held in June 1993, 58 percent said going into Iraq was the right thing to do, with only 34 percent opposing military action. In October 2003 41 percent were for the war and 50 percent were against. Iraq has returned to the spotlight in Britain since the seizing of a 62-year-old British engineer, Paul Bigley, from his Baghdad home on September 16 along with two US colleagues who have since been executed.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Monday urged Myanmar's military rulers to accept the return of a UN special envoy to discuss democratic reforms in the country, saying it was troubled by the continued detention of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The call followed a meeting last week between UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and his special envoy to Myanmar, Razali Ismail, and "concerned" members of the global body on the lack of progress toward democracy and national reconciliation in Myanmar. "We urge the Burmese authorities to allow Ambassador Razali to return to Burma without delay and to conduct follow-up visits as he deems necessary," deputy US State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said. Myanmar's previous name was Burma. "We hope that the secretary general will remain focused on this matter and that his engagement will generate more international community international community cooperation on this vital issue," Ereli said. The United States, he said, "remains deeply concerned" by the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and the failure of the junta to permit her National League for Democracy (NLD) to open its offices nationwide and operate freely. Ereli said Washington was also dismayed by the the junta's refusal to release over 1,000 political prisoners, and by the recent arrest of political activist U Ohne Thant an her NLD colleagues "should be released and allowed to resume political activities," according to a UN statement. She also pressed for the NLD's offices to be reopened. But hopes of Aung San Suu Kyi's release fizzled out and the junta proceeded with the national convention without the opposition. The United States in recent months has stepped up pressure on the junta to release Aung San Suu Kyi after imposing wideranging sanctions on the impoverished country. The US Congress last week called for UN Security Council action against Yangon while seven major US groups cancelled their trips to Myanmar in response to a call for a boycott of tourism to the country by NLD.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SAO PAULO, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Monday he hopes Israel's bloody military operations in Gaza will end soon. Powell repeated the US position that Israel had a right to defend itself, but called on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to use proportionate response to recent Palestinian rocket attacks. "Mr Sharon finds the need to respond to that," Powell said shortly before arriving here on an official, two-day visit. "I hope that it does not expand, I hope that whatever he does is proportionate to the threat that Israel is facing and I hope that this operation can come to a conclusion quickly," Powell said. Israel said its troops could be in northern Gaza for weeks. Since Israel began the operation six days ago, at least 77 Palestinians have been killed in the deadliest incursion into Gaza since the start of the intifada, or uprising, in 2000. On Monday, eight Palestinians, including a child and a teenage girl, were killed by Israeli fire. Israel's chief of staff said Monday that the operation, which is intended to establish a buffer zone to prevent Palestinian militants from firing rockets at Israel, could last for weeks. The Gaza incursion has sparked deep international concern, including a weekend call from UN chief Kofi Annan for Israel to halt the operation. On Monday, Egypt called the incursion a "dangerous escalation." Powell will meet students, business leaders and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BEIJING, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[China's online game industry could grow seven-fold to become a billion-dollar business within the next two years, state media reported Tuesday, citing industry insiders. The online game market has the potential to post revenue of 9.3 billion yuan (1.1 billion dollars) by 2006, up from the current 1.3 billion yuan, Xinhua news agency said. China, with 200 million young people, is emerging as the world's most promising market for online games, Xinhua quoted unidentified foreign businesspeople as saying. There are 13.8 million online gamers in China, up from zero 10 years ago, according to the agency. Despite the rosy growth forecasts, China has announced strict curbs on the industry. State media reported last week that the government had set up an official body to promote "healthy" online computer games for young people. The Professional Commission of Online Games will launch a national club for game-players and build a server of suitable games, recommending "healthy games to juveniles as an effort to clean up young people's online environment." It will also rate online games according to their various levels of "pornography, violence, horror, social morality and cultural implications," reports have said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Blair heads off to Africa on trip aimed at securing legacy by Peter Walker.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Freshly recovered from a heart operation, British Prime Minister Tony Blair was scheduled to fly to Ethiopia on Tuesday on a personal aid mission which he hopes will also provide a restorative boost to his own place in history. Blair leaves behind feverish speculation about his future in power for a few brief days to attend a meeting of the Commission for Africa, the body he set up earlier this year to galvanise development efforts on the continent. The event in Addis Ababa is the second full meeting of the Commission, which gathers 17 dignitaries from Africa and other nations, ranging from Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to Irish pop star turned charity organiser Bob Geldof. On Thursday and Friday they will continue work on a report about the future of Africa, intended to be published early next year. Blair has pledged to make Africa a key foreign policy objective during 2005, when Britain holds the rotating presidency of both the G8 industrialised nations' club and the European Union. His trip follows an operation last week to correct an irregular heartbeat, which helped fuel conjecture about his future in the most stressful of jobs, which he has filled for seven years. Announcing the operation on Thursday evening, Blair also took the surprise step of revealing that if his Labour Party won a general election expected next year, he would serve a third complete term as prime minister, but no more. The revelation, unprecedented in British politics, was seen by pundits as a tactic to head off challenges within a Labour Party riven by dissent over Blair's decision to back the US-led war in Iraq. However it instead prompted a swathe of newspaper stories wondering whether Blair could stay on as premier so long, with some predicting a possible challenge from arch-rival Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. Blair's focus on Africa appeared to show that the prime minister -- expected to win the next election -- was starting to think about the eventual legacy of his period in power, said Doctor Paul Kelly, of the politics department at the London School of Economics. "I think he's certainly looking for his place in history," Kelly told AFP. "I think there's a certain amount of pressure to show something positive and long-term for his premiership," he said. "The Iraq war has cast a very long shadow over the premiership, certainly in the last parliament. I'll think he'll want to show something more than that, and also something more than just being a great winner of elections." Late last month, Britain delighted aid agencies by announcing it would unilaterally write off its share of debts owed to the World Bank by the world's poorest countries. Blair's efforts towards Africa were welcome, but the Commission had to be sure it was not just trying to "reinvent the wheel" by telling aid groups what they already knew, British charity Oxfam said. "It's welcome in the sense that it is bringing attention to the issue, but at the same time it mustn't be another talking shop," Oxfam spokeswoman Helen Palmer told AFP. "Africa doesn't need another report for the sake of it." Among measures needed were an end the "blatant injustice" of agricultural subsidies to western farmers, debt relief, and targeted aid in areas such as primary education, she said. "If this report can come up with real solutions and real concrete actions at the end of it to address the problems that are there then it will be worthwhile, but if it's just a top-down talking shop then it won't have really achieved its purpose."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[AUCKLAND, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[One of seven men facing sex charges on the remote British Pacific colony of Pitcairn Island pleaded guilty Monday in abuse trials involving more than half the island's adult men, Radio New Zealand reported. Postmaster Dennis Christian, 49, pleaded guilty to three of four charges. The fourth was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence. Radio New Zealand said Christian admitted indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl in the early 1980s. The details of the two other charges were suppressed. Judge Russell Johnson remanded Christian on bail but he faces the prospect of a jail sentence. Seven of the island's 12 adult men are charged with a total of 55 sex crimes, some dating back 40 years. Christian's sentencing will not take place until the cases against all seven are dealt with. Britain's Daily Telegraph, one of six media organisations allowed on the island, quoted chief trial prosecutor Simon Moore of rape; his son, Dave Brown, 49, on 15 sexual abuse charges, including assault of a five-year-old; and the island's mayor, Steven Christian, 53, on trial on six charges of rape and four of indecent assault. The island marks Saturday as its Sabbath and so the courts sat on Sunday. In Steve Christian's trial, police read out in court a statement Sunday from the second of the two alleged rape victims. "Steve seemed to take it upon himself to initiate all of the girls on the island. It was like we were his harem," the statement said. Pitcairn was uninhabited until mate Fletcher Christian aboard the Royal Navy ship HMS Bounty led a mutiny on April 28, 1789 against Captain William Bligh, who was set adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Eight mutineers along with six Tahitian men, 12 Tahitian women and a small girl then searched the South Seas for a haven, reaching uninhabited Pitcairn on January 15, 1790. Six other island men charged with sex crimes have yet to be extradited from Australia and New Zealand.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President Jacques Chirac embarks on an eight-day Asian tour Tuesday aimed at winning France a bigger slice of China's super-hot economic pie by playing on political and cultural relations that have grown noticeably closer. Chirac and 50 corporate chiefs were to fly out of Paris for a first, brief stop in Singapore, before heading on to Vietnam where the president will make a two-day state visit before attending an Asia-EU summit in Hanoi on Friday. On Saturday, he begins the main reason for the trip: a four-day state visit to China during which he and the delegation will try to convince officials that France can be "the partner of reference" in many areas -- but particularly business-wise. At stake is a piece of China's 1.4-trillion-dollar economy, which is continuing to expand at around nine percent this year. France currently ranks as China's fourth-biggest trading partner in the European Union and it wants to climb up the scale. Bilateral exchanges stand at 13.4 billion dollars yet French companies hold only 1.2 percent of the Asian giant's vast emerging market. By chasing deals in sectors such as nuclear energy, transport and aviation, Chirac -- a noted Sinophile with a passion for Chinese art -- hopes to see France gain privileged status. In that, he is helped by the shared vision of the two permanent UN Security Council members of a multi-polar world skipping out of the shadow of the dominant United States, and of an mutual appreciation of each other's culture, which is the subject of a two-year programme of exchanges started in 2003. Chirac's courtship could be seen in January this year, when Chinese President Hu Jintao visited France and the Eiffel Tower was lit red in his honour. Last week, a Chinese foreign ministry official, Shen Guofang, highlighted agreement "on many points to do with international and regional issues." He added: "During the presidential visit, we are going to study all means of cooperating more effectively, notably at the level of companies and their chiefs." The touchy subject of China's human rights record has been overshadowed by France's mercantile strategy, but Chirac's aides said the president would raise the subject "as he always does. politely and discreetly." Deals in the offing include a possible two-billion-euro (2.4-billion-dollar) purchase of Airbus aircraft by China Southern and Air China, and, longer-term, a sounding out of interest for 10 of Airbus's future 555-seat A380 superjumbos ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. French engineering group Alstom is also in the running for a 12-billion-euro project to provide high-speed trains between Beijing and Shanghai, while nuclear energy group Areva is looking ahead to tenders of three new nuclear power stations.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President Gloria Arroyo blamed Tuesday communist and Muslim separatist insurgencies and the high jobless rate for hunger and poverty in the Philippines. "We cannot shut our eyes to the truth of hunger and poverty. The immediate causes are unemployment in the cities, and pockets of conflict in the countryside," she said in a written statement. "Our key and current programs are to forge peace at the rural community level and move to decongest the slum belts in the cities so that we can spread more room for self-reliant enterprise," she said. The government is holding peace talks with Muslim separatists waging a decades-old rebellion on the southern island of Mindanao but is having less success with communist guerrillas. An August 5-22 national survey by Manila-based Social Weather Stations found a "near-record-high 15.1 percent of household heads reporting that their families had experienced hunger, without having anything to eat, at least once in the last three months". Fifty-three percent of households rated themselves as poor. An International Monetary Fund country report released this week said four in 10 Filipinos earned two dollars a day or less. Official figures show the Philippines jobless rate stood at 13.7 percent in April.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The US army announced Monday that it has charged four soldiers with murdering an Iraqi general while he was being interrogated in Iraq in late 2003. The soldiers are "under charges of murder and dereliction of duty," said Judy Dutt, a spokesperson at the US army base at Fort Carson, in the western state of Colorado. Prosecutors claim the soldiers asphyxiated Iraqi Major General Abed Hamed Mowhoush, 57, during an interrogation on November 26 last year in Qaim, Iraq. The army first said that Mowhoush said he was feeling ill when he lost consciousness. In May however they said that Mowhoush had been asphyxiated. The soldiers -- Chief Warrant Officers Jefferson Williams and Lewis Welshofer Jr, Sergeant First Class William Sommer and Specialist Jerry Loper -- remain on active duty and have not been jailed. At the time were assigned to the Fort Carson-based 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which was deployed in Iraq. Those found guilty of murder could spend life in prison. Dereliction of duty charges carry a six-month maximum prison sentence. According to the Denver Post newspaper, the soldiers put Mowhoush inside a sleeping bag while they were interrogating him. Welshofer sat on Mowhoush's chest and put his hands on the Iraqi general's mouth, according to the paper, quoting an internal army report. The four soldiers first have to go through Article 32 pre-trial hearings before a decision whether to proceed with a court martial is made, said Dutt. There is no date for the hearing, she added.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush and Democratic rival John Kerry battled Monday over science, taxes and Iraq, as the spotlight of their newly tight race shifted to their running mates' only televised debate. After signing legislation extending tax cuts, Bush said in the key up-for-grabs state of Iowa that Kerry would raise taxes on the US middle class and warned that his foreign policy would be "dangerous for world peace." Wooing voters in the battleground state of New Hampshire, Kerry accused Bush of choosing to "sacrifice science for extreme right-wing ideology" by restricting the use of government funds for stem-cell research. The two candidates, next scheduled to face off in person on Friday, sized up polls showing Kerry clawing even with the Republican on the strength of his showing Thursday in their first of three televised debates. Two polls showed Bush clinging to a modest lead after the televised encounter, but three others called the race a virtual dead heat less than a month before the November 2 election. Bush, who lost Iowa by a hair in 2000, has a razor-thin edge there. Kerry and the president look tied in New Hampshire, which narrowly went to Bush in 2000. Bush's tepid performance in the debate added importance to Tuesday's encounter between Vice President Dick Cheney and his Democratic counterpart, Senator John Edwards, in the midwestern city of Cleveland. Commentators said Cheney would seek to repair the damage from Kerry's relentless attacks on the Iraq war and renew the focus on Bush's leadership after the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes. Edwards was likely to use his skills as a trial lawyer to skewer Cheney as the architect of the administration's security policies, which led to windfall reconstruction contracts for his a company he formerly ran, Halliburton. With the November 2 election closing fast, the president and the challenger were to square off Friday in the second of their three debates in the midwestern city of St. Louis, Missouri. The Kerry campaign kept up the pressure Monday, publishing a list of more than 180 former US ambassadors endorsing the Democrat, out of concern over the administration's foreign policy. Meanwhile, Bush redoubled his efforts to discredit Kerry as a potential commander in chief, pointing to the senator's vote against the 1991 Gulf War to oust Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. "The policies of my opponent are dangerous for world peace. If they were implemented they would make this world not more peaceful, but more dangerous," Bush told cheering supporters in Clive, Iowa. Kerry was joined in the eastern city of Hampton, New Hampshire by actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, as he blasted Bush's decision to limit publicly funded research using stem cells from human embryos. He said such studies could help find cures for diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and diabeeves that the federal government ought to be making the decisions," Bush told cheering supporters the Iowa capital of Des Moines. "He's got a system that's creeping toward 'Hillarycare.'" Bush also signed legislation extending tax relief for married couples, a tax credit for children and expanding a 10 percent tax rate to include more low-income families. He warned against Kerry's pledge to roll back taxes on the wealthiest Americans. "He says, oh, I'm just going to tax the rich. Well, the rich hire lawyers and accountants for a reason -- that's to stick you with the tab," said Bush, who like Kerry is a millionaire. Bush's campaign unleashed another television advertisement against Kerry, who has condemned the administration's 10-year, trillion-dollar tax cuts as overwhelmingly benefiting the wealthiest and major US firms. The commercial accuses Kerry and other Democratic lawmakers of voting 350 times for higher taxes, including increased levies on gasoline and Social Security benefits. The Kerry campaign countered by accusing the administration of doing nothing to reduce the country's dependence on Middle East oil, as costs hover near 50 dollars a barrel.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[US Mercury astronaut, space pioneer Gordon Cooper dead at 77 (ADDS details).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Gordon Cooper, one of the original Mercury astronauts who pioneered the US role in outer space, died Monday at his home in Ventura, California, NASA announced. He was 77. Cooper, a former Air Force colonel, piloted the sixth and final flight of the Mercury program -- the first US manned space flight -- and later commanded Gemini V. The May 15-16, 1963 manned space flight lasted more than 34 hours and 22 orbits around the Earth -- more than three times the longest manned American space flight until then, and far beyond the initial design capability of the capsule. That mission also made him the first person to sleep in space. "As one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, Gordon Cooper was one of the faces of America's fledgling space program," NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said in a statement. Cooper "truly portrayed the right stuff, and he helped gain the backing and enthusiasm of the American public, so critical for the spirit of exploration." Cooper and his fellow astronauts, known as the "Mercury Seven," -- Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, Wally Schirra and Deke Slayton -- were immortalized in the Tom Wolfe bestseller "The Right Stuff." The book was turned into a blockbuster Hollywood movie in 1983, in which actor Dennis Quaid played the young, hot-shot pilot Cooper. Leroy Gordon Cooper Jr was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, in 1927. He served in the Marine Corps and then went to the University of Hawaii. He received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Army, and then from 1950 to 1954 was an Air Force fighter pilot in Germany. He completed his university studies at the Air Force Institute of Technology, and then trained to become a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Cooper kept working as a test pilot until he was picked to become an astronaut as the youngest man on the Mercury team. After the landmark 1963 flight, he and astronaut Charles Conrad flew an eight-day mission that, despite many problems, helped prove to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that a mission to the moon was possible. Cooper retired in 1970, but continued to work in a number of industries, including helping Walt Disney Productions with its futuristic Epcot theme park at DisneyWorld in Orlando, Florida. He is survived by his wife, Susan, and two daughters. NASA did not reveal the cause of Cooper's death.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[CHERBOURG, France, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Anti-nuclear demonstrators were on the alert, and under close judicial scrutiny, at the French Channel port of Cherbourg Tuesday awaiting the imminent arrival of a consignment of military-grade plutonium which they consider to be an environmental threat. Two British-registered vessels carrying 140 kilograms (308 pounds) of plutonium from US weapons arsenals were expected to dock here after a voyage from North Carolina. Authorities kept the docking date and hour a strict secret, citing security reasons, and forcing protesters to hold all-night vigils at the port. At a court hearing later Tuesday the French nuclear processing company Areva was hoping to gain an injunction banning ecology watchdog Greenpeace from demonstrating any nearer than 100 metres (yards) from the vessels in dock, at less than 300 metres at sea inside French territorial waters, and at less than 100 metres from the overland convoy scheduled to convey the plutonium through France, Greenpeace said. Some of the many anti-nuclear protesters gathered here were nonetheless exploring the possibility of some kind of protest action, to be planned with the greatest discretion so as not to alert authorities. "We are closely studying the possibility of taking action, but we can't say anything in advance, especially not over the phone," activist Philippe Le Marechal, coordinator for the anti-nuclear flotilla here told AFP. While the local authorities were playing their cards equally close to their chests, giving no indication as to the arrival time of the controversial cargo, the protesters were on high alert Tuesday for the slightest indication of the imminent arrival of the two British-registered vessels carrying a shipment of 140 kilograms (308 pounds) of plutonium from US weapons arsenals after a two-week voyage from North Carolina on the east coast of the United States. The plutonium is to be taken to the French nuclear reconditioning plant at The Hague, then sent to a facility in southern France to be recycled and eventually returned for civilian use in the United States. Three Greenpeace activists in a flotilla protesting the shipment were released from police custody Monday. They included French yachtsman Eugene Riguidel, whose sailboat was impounded by the police. Riguidel's boat was boarded after it touched buoys marking the military zone. The crew -- Riguidel, Jonathan Castle, first captain of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior, and Pernilla Svenberg of Greenpeace International in Amsterdam -- were taken into custody for 24 hours. Protesters have also taken up position along the land route to be followed by the road convoy to the plant at La Hague. Banners proclaimed "Stop plutonium."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Women running scared ahead of Afghan poll: Human Rights Watch.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[KABUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Warlords and hardline Islamic Taliban insurgents are threatening and attacking women to scare them away from polling booths in Afghanistan's upcoming presidential elections, a rights group said Tuesday. The failure of international donor countries, including the United States and Germany, to send promised funds on time to boost security was partly to blame, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said. The figures say that 41 percent of the 10.5 million registered Afghan voters are women, but in some provinces in the troubled southeast of the country the figure drops to under 10 percent. A "pervasive atmosphere of fear" persists for women involved in politics despite improvements in women's lives since the fall of the Taliban regime after the US-led invasion in 2001, the report said. "Many Afghan women risk their safety if they participate in public life," said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the women's rights division of Human Rights Watch. The administration of President George W. Bush "is particularly proud of the progress women have made. But Afghan women themselves say their hopes for even basic rights have gone unfulfilled." US backed interim President Hamid Karzai, installed after the invasion, is widely expected to win the election on October 9 against 17 other candidates. The report describes how women are targeted for challenging their traditional roles in society, reporting death threats, harassment and attacks for speaking out about sensitive issues such as divorce. In the months running up to the vote on October 9 at least 12 election workers have been killed, at least three of them women, and dozens injured. "The failure of international donor countries -- including the United States and Germany -- to send promised funds on time and bolster security may adversely affect women's participation on election day," the report said. It called on the United States and NATO, which have a total of more than 27,000 troops in the country, to "vastly increase their troop contributions" and fulfill their commitments to promote women's rights. The troops should also refocus their attention towards disarming militias run by regional warlords and protecting targeted groups such as women and independent political players. "Through intimidation and armed attacks, local warlord factions, the Taliban and other insurgent forces have forced the closure of women's development projects which provide desperately needed education, health, rights awareness and job training to women and girls," Human Rights Watch said. The report points out that while the large numbers of women registered to vote is an important sign of progress, multiple registrations have inflated official election figures. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for April next year, and Human Rights Watch says they will present greater challenges, with women afraid to stand for election.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[France is seeking to enhance its already strong economic and political ties with Singapore, French President Jacques Chirac wrote in the Straits Times on Tuesday ahead of his visit to the city-state. Chirac will meet with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong during his brief stop-over in Singapore on Wednesday for his second visit to the Southeast Asian nation as president. In a commentary piece published in the Straits Times, the city-state's major English language daily, Chirac said he wanted to visit Lee to emphasise France's commitment to maintaining more than 30 years of warm bilateral ties. "It is only natural for me to come and meet him in order to show France's determination in continuing our relations with Singapore, which are based on friendship, trust and partnership," Chirac wrote. Chirac highlighted the two nations' strong business links, with Singapore being France's third largest trading partner and 400 French companies based in the city-state. "We are now considering new developments and new partnerships that will help to strengthen our countries' relations with each other. I shall be discussing these promising prospects with my hosts," he wrote. Although Chirac did not mention military links, his visit comes amid strong lobbying from France for Singapore to buy a fleet of French Rafale fighter jets. Singapore has shortlisted the Rafale, along with the Boeing's F-15 Eagle and Europe's Eurofighter Typhoon, to replace its squadron of Skyhawk combat aircraft in a deal expected to be worth more than one billion US dollars. Chirac is also on Wednesday expected to meet with Lee Kuan Yew, Lee's father and the first prime minister of Singapore with whom the French leader has long enjoyed a close friendship. Chirac wrote in his commentary piece that the elder Lee was "one of the leading statesmen of our time". Chirac's first trip to Singapore was in 1996, the year after he took office. He will travel to Vietnam on Wednesday for the Asia-EU summit in Hanoi, before spending four days in China for the main leg of his Asian tour.]]></c>

The dollar stood at 110.76 yen in Tokyo morning trade, down from 110.96 yen in New York late Monday. The euro fell to 1.2276 dollars from 1.2283 dollars while rising to 135.96 yen from 135.30 yen. "Trading lacked a clear direction as investors found few leads in the market," said Hideyuki Tsukamoto, dealer at Mizuho Bank. "Investors were also taking a wait-and-see stance ahead of Friday's release of US employment report," Tsukamoto said. The US economy generated 144,000 jobs in August in a sign that the labor market was improving slightly after two sluggish months.

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The United States on Monday strongly condemned a wave of violence in India's northeastern states and hoped New Delhi would swiftly identify the culprits and punish them. The condemnation came as India ordered extra troops to the troubled Assam and neighbouring Nagaland states in a bid to stem a wave of rebel-linked violence which has killed 69 people and injured 210 in the past three days. "The United States strongly condemns the wave of violence in India's northeastern states during the October 2-3 weekend," deputy State Department spokesman Adam Ereli said in a statement. He said there was "no justification for these senseless attacks. "We extend our deepest sympathies to the victims and their families and hope that Indian authorities will be able quickly identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice," Ereli said. Aside from beefing security presence in the country's northeast, India also deployed on Monday extra soldiers along its borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar. The bloodletting coincided with the 18th anniversary of the founding of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), one of around 30 rebel groups fighting for greater autonomy or independence in the region. The NDFB and the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) have claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in Assam. Most of the rebel groups say they are seeking to protect their ethnic identities and allege the federal government has exploited the resources in the mineral and oil-rich region. Neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar have been accused of harboring camps of militant groups on their soil. More than 50,000 people have lost their lives to insurgency in the northeast since India's independence in 1947.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[At least 22 people died in Baghdad and Mosul car bombings, which targeted the fledgling Iraqi army, Westerners and the US military, as US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned Monday of more offensives like one just ended in Samarra. In Samarra at least 150 people, including an unknown number of civilians, were killed and scores wounded in two days of fighting there. "What has to be done in that country is what happened in Samarra over the last 48 hours," Rumsfeld said in Washington. "You cannot allow a series of safe havens or a consistent pattern of misbehavior, anti-social behavior, violence against the government of Iraq to go on over a sustained period of time," he said. Rumsfeld also said that he knew of no "hard" intelligence tying ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, one of President George W. Bush's justifications for invading Iraq. "To my knowledge, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence that links the two," Rumsfeld said. In Baghdad, a car bomb exploded outside an army recruitment center as hundreds of young men waited inside. The army recruitment center is adjacent to the Green Zone, housing US embassy and the interim Iraqi government. The blast killed at least 15 people and wounded 84, according to medics at Yarmuk hospital. Many of the men came from poor southern provinces in hopes of improving their lot. Shortly after the first car bomb a second explosion ripped the center of Baghdad, this time targeting a convoy of four-wheel-drive vehicles in an area close to several hotels housing Westerners. The attack killed at least four and wounded 17, many of them bystanders. The killing spread to the northern city of Mosul where a car bomb exploded near a school killing three, including a child, and wounding 11, half of them children. Two other car bomb attacks hit the city targeting two separate US military convoys, according to the US military. The first one occurred at 4:00 pm (1300 GMT) on Baath street, wounding one soldier. One hour later a second car bomb targeted a convoy traveling in the southern part of the city, but no casualties were immediately reported. Two US soldiers were killed by small-arms fire in Baghdad on Sunday, the military said Monday, bringing the number of US soldiers in Iraq since the invasion last year to 1,051 according to a Pentagon tally. Rebels opposed to US-led forces and interim Iraqi government of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi have used car bombs and assassinations against security forces and high-profile officials, in a bid to make the country ungovernable. US and Iraqi officials blame Jordanian-born militant Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, said to be linked to Al-Qaeda, for some of the deadliest attacks. The car bombings in Baghdad and Mosul came right after two pre-dawn raids by US warplanes on suspected Zarqawi hideouts in the insurgent bastion of Fallujah, west of the capital. Hospitals in the city said nine people died in the attacks, including women and children. The US military has been conducting almost daily raids on the city in what it insists are "precision" strikes, aimed at flushing out the Zarqawi operatives while minimizing what it calls "collateral damage." Adding to the carnage, two Iraqis died and six were wounded in a roadside bomb in the rebel stronghold of Ramadi west of the capital, while a police commander and a schoolgirl were killed in separate attacks northeast of Baghdad. And Thamer Abdellatif, a top science ministry official, and a female civil servant, Ikhlas Ghalib, were shot dead in Baghdad, an interior ministry spokesman said. An Iraqi working for the Americans was found beheaded Monday on a roadside near the northern city of Kirkuk, police said. Lieutenant Colonel Ahmed Obeidi told AFP that the man's body, with the head placed on its back, was found 80f its troops out of Iraq by the end of 2005 and Italy suggested that forces from Muslim countries should gradually take over from the current US-led troops. In Britain, a poll in the Times newspaper showed support for keeping the 9,000 troops in Iraq, up to 49 percent, while 42 percent want the troops out, up from 42-51 percent July.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KARACHI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President Pervez Musharraf's reshuffle of Pakistan's army top brass and appointment of a new spy chief suggests he will reverse a promise to step down as army chief by year's end, according to analysts. Musharraf, the army chief-cum-president who seized power in a bloodless coup in October 1999, looks more determined than ever to retain his dual posts, in the face of opposition outrage, to push through his agenda of stamping out Islamic militancy and pursuing peace with India, they said. For months Musharraf has been hinting in media interviews that he may abandon a pledge to shed his uniform by December 31 -- a promise made late last year in a deal to win the support of Islamist parties. He says Pakistan needs him in the strong position that leadership of the army gives him because he has to tackle sensitive issues like resolving the 56-year-old dispute with India over Kashmir, crushing Islamic extremism and weeding out Al-Qaeda militants. The deal he struck with opposition lawmakers last year would allow him to remain civilian president until 2007. In the surprise weekend shake up Musharraf promoted the head of Pakistan's premier spy agency, Lieutenant General Ehsanul Haq, to chairman of the armed forces' joint chiefs of staff. He also promoted the army chief of commercial capital Karachi, Lieutenant General Ahsan Saleem Hayat, to deputy army chief. Hayat survived an Al-Qaeda-linked assassination attempt early June when gunmen opened fire on his convoy, killing 11 people. The two generals they are replacing will retire. Lieutenant General Ashfaq Pervez Kiyani was named as the new head of the spay agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, which directs Pakistan's Al-Qaeda hunt. The changes show that Musharraf has a "firm grip on the army and is very unlikely to quit" as army chief, former interior minister and retired general Moinuddin Haider said. "This fresh appointment indicates that Musharraf would like to continue as army chief," Haider told AFP. "Musharraf will now have time to implement his agenda with ease." Defence analyst Talat Masood, another former general, told AFP: "These promotions indicate his intention not to quit as army chief. He certainly has strengthened his hold on power." The top-level military changes came a day after Pakistan's main fundamentalist party Jamaat-i-Islami warned it would launch a protest campaign to dislodge Musharraf if he did not abdicate as army chief. Musharraf draws most of his power from the army, and analysts say that without the army behind him he would rapidly lose legitimacy as he was never elected to the presidency. "Musharraf feels that without uniform he may not be powerful enough to address issues like Kashmir or take bold decisions against terrorism," senior political analyst Monis Aamir said. "It appears that the army does not want to give a chance to democracy, nor does it want to lose its grip on power." Professor Mutahair Ahmed of Karachi University's international relations department believed the international community would likely tolerate any decision by Musharraf to break his pledge. "For the United States and Western countries the issue of his uniform is an internal matter for Pakistan and they are unlikely to react if Musharraf decides to stay as army chief," Ahmed said. "The face of a powerful Musharraf is important for them with or without uniform."]]></c>

Lieutenant General Ashfaq Pervez Kiyani was named as the new head of the spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, which directs Pakistan's Al-Qaeda hunt. The changes show that Musharraf has a "firm grip on the army and is very unlikely to quit" as army chief, former interior minister and retired general Moinuddin Haider said. "This fresh appointment indicates that Musharraf would like to continue as army chief," Haider told AFP. "Musharraf will now have time to implement his agenda with ease." Defence analyst Talat Masood, another former general, told AFP: "These promotions indicate his intention not to quit as army chief. He certainly has strengthened his hold on power." The top-level military changes came a day after Pakistan's main fundamentalist party Jamaat-i-Islami warned it would launch a protest campaign to dislodge Musharraf if he did not abdicate as army chief. Musharraf draws most of his power from the army, and analysts say that without the army behind him he would rapidly lose legitimacy as he was never elected to the presidency. "Musharraf feels that without uniform he may not be powerful enough to address issues like Kashmir or take bold decisions against terrorism," senior political analyst Monis Aamir said. "It appears that the army does not want to give a chance to democracy, nor does it want to lose its grip on power." Professor Mutahair Ahmed of Karachi University's international relations department believed the international community would likely tolerate any decision by Musharraf to break his pledge. "For the United States and Western countries the issue of his uniform is an internal matter for Pakistan and they are unlikely to react if Musharraf decides to stay as army chief," Ahmed said. "The face of a powerful Musharraf is important for them with or without uniform."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MOJAVE, California, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The world's first private rocket ship blasted into space Monday for the second time in five days, snatching a 10-million-dollar prize and ushering in a new era of space tourism. In a flawless mission, SpaceShipOne, piloted by former US navy test pilot Brian Binnie, also smashed the sub-orbital flight altitude record, reaching 367,442 feet (69.6 miles/112 kilometers), judges announced. "We have truly entered a new space age," said US astronaut Rick Searfoss, chief judge of the 10-million-dollar Ansari X Prize, declaring SpaceShipOne the winner of the purse designed to spawn commercial space travel. "It's an age that will be defined by the art of the impossible, not by what is politically possible," he said, adding that the US government space programme had "in many respects lost its way." US President George W. Bush called the spacecraft's designer, aviation pioneer Burt Rutan and his team to congratulate them on their feat, organisers said. "This is a historic day," said Marion Blakey, head of the Federal Aviation Administration as awarded Binnie his astronaut wings after he glided back into California's Mojave desert to the cheers of thousands. The stubby, winged SpaceShipOne had "opened a new frontier in commercial human space travel" that will revolutionise both space and earthly transport, Blakey said. The white star-spangled ship, about the size of a truck with a pointy nose and short, fat body is more reminiscent of a fantasy craft from 1930s comic book "Flash Gordon" than it is of state-of-the art technology. But during its nearly 90-minute flight that took it to the edge of space, the craft reached speeds of up to 3,500 kilometers (2,187 miles) per hour before punching through the Earth's atmosphere. It broke the altitude record for sub-orbital flight of 354,200 feet (67 miles/108 kilometers) set by the X-15 rocket plane 41 years ago. "We blew the X-15 away," said Peter Diamandis, president of the X Prize Foundation that will award the SpaceShipOne team a cheque for 10 million dollars and a trophy at ceremony in St. Louis on November 6. As SpaceShipOne touched down, Rutan stood alongside British tycoon Richard Branson and Diamandis leaping for joy and cheering. Branson, owner of the Virgin Atlantic airline, last week announced plans to join the private space race using a craft based on SpaceShipOne, offering passengers space jaunts for about 200,000 dollars a trip. To win the X Prize, the same reusable manned spacecraft needed to make two journeys into space within two weeks while carrying the equivalent weight of two passengers. Rutan was jubilant, saying he could hardly believe he and his Mojave Aerospace Ventures team had won the prize after flying just six powered flights, including three space flights, in SpaceShipOne. Long an outspoken adversary of the mainstream space industry and NASA, Rutan cocked a victorious snoot at his rivals, deriding what he called the "Boeings, the Lockheeds, the naysayers in Houston." "I have a hell of lot bigger goal than they do," he said vowing to develop a private commercial spacecraft for Branson that would be "at least 100 times safer than anything that is ever flown into space." Pilot Binnie, 51, described the flight that earned him his astronaut's wings as a "dream come true," revealing that he floated a model of SpaceShipOne in its cockpit as he became weightless for about four minutes. During the first leg of its X Prize bid on Wednesday, SpaceShipOne -- piloted by Mike Melville, who flew its first space flight on June 21 -- the plane rolled 29 times, corkscrewing through the sky and striking horror into the hearts of onlookers. But there were no problems this time and Binnie managed to ignite the rocket enge X Prize, funded by private donors, was established in 1996 and modelled on the 25,000-dollar Orteig prize that aviator Charles Lindbergh won when he became the first solo pilot to cross the Atlantic in 1927, spurring commercial air travel.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Colin Powell on Monday blamed supporters of ousted Haitian president Jean Bertrand Aristide for last week's unrest in the Caribbean nation, which is still reeling from deadly storms and floods that killed 1,550 people in September. "These are the old Aristide elements and some criminal elements who are trying to take advantage of the situation," Powell told reporters shortly before arriving here on an official two-day visit. "I talked to (UN Secretary General) Kofi Annan last night about it and he feels confident that his people can manage it and control it and work very closely with the Haitian authorities. And we're trying to expedite the additional peacekeepers who are going in," Powell said. At least ten people died in Haiti on Thursday and Friday in clashes between police and protesters. The unrest broke out in the Haitian capital Thursday during a demonstration staged by Aristide supporters to mark the thirteenth anniversary of a military coup that ousted him in 1991. Despite the presence of 4,000 UN police and peacekeepers, militant Aristide supporters and opponents have yet to be disarmed. The political situation in the poorest country in the Americas remains fragile ahead of general elections scheduled for 2005. And Haiti is still suffering in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Jeanne, which ravaged the northern city of Gonaives two weeks ago, killing more than 1,500. Flooding left tens of thousands homeless and completely dependent on international aid.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Australian opposition split over environment four days from polls.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[HOBART, Australia, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Four days before the Australian election, the opposition Labor party was Tuesday facing a damaging split over a plan to protect renowned wild forests in the island state of Tasmania. Labor MP Dick Adams, who represents Tasmania in the federal parliament, warned that Labor leader Mark Latham's promise to end logging in some of Tasmania's renowned old growth forests could cost him three vital seats in what is expected to be a tight contest. Latham, whose party needs second preference votes from supporters of the increasingly popular Australian Greens to have any chance of winning on Saturday, has been accused of trying to lock in the support of the Greens with his forestry policy at the expense of timber jobs in Tasmania. In a move condemned by timber workers and many politicians, but welcomed by the Greens, Latham promised to end logging in some of Tasmania's most renowned natural forests and spend 800 million dollars (576 million US) to protect forestry jobs. The row has flared as a new opinion poll, the second in two days, gave Prime Minister John Howard's conservative government an election-winning lead. The Australian's Newspoll, put Howard's Liberal-National coalition ahead -- by 50.5 to 49.5 percent -- for the first time in the election campaign. The Sydney Morning Herald's ACNielsen survey, which put the government ahead for a fortnight, gave it a lead of 52-48 percent in its poll published on Monday, enough to return the conservatives to office for a fourth term with a similar eight-seat majority. Both polls also show Labor is dependent on the second preference votes of the minor parties, particularly the Greens, to win office. Under Australia's complex preferential system, voters' second choices or "preferences" can be the deciding factor in handing victory to one of the major parties. The Newspoll showed that on primary votes the ruling Liberal-National coalition was leading by 46 percent to 39 percent. But with the minor party second preferences going heavily to Labor, the government leads by one percentage point at 50.5-49.5. Latham said that if elected, Labor would appoint an "eminent" Australian, such as former prime minister Bob Hawke and a panel of forestry experts to review the 240,000 hectares (590,000 acres) of old-growth forestry. Adams said Labor's forestry strategy could backfire, with three of its five Tasmanian seats at risk. "I think that's a terrible thing to have done, all because we want to win seats in Melbourne and Sydney," he added. "I think that there's been decisions made, that there's better chances of winning seats on the mainland and there's been a total sell-out of the Tasmanian Labor position." Tasmania's state Labor Premier Paul Lennon said timber workers' futures had been bargained away by Latham to grab Greens' preferences in mainland marginal seats. "What we will be doing is waiting to see what happens on Saturday and then we will be talking to whoever is elected, on Monday, basically to try to resolve these issues. "We certainly will not give up lightly." Latham defended his policy Tuesday, saying it was about the environment and future generations of workers, not about politics. "This is the right thing to do and our plan will protect jobs and ensure that there are no net job losses in the forest industry in Tasmania," he told a Melbourne radio station. "I don't want to die wondering about future generations of Australians and their access to the mighty Tasmanian forests."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[If Australian opposition leader Mark Latham wins the October 9 election it will be a new-found ability to bite his tongue, as much as a bold strategy platform, that delivers him the keys to the prime minister's office. Latham has successfully reinvented himself since he took on the Labor Party leadership last December with a self-described reputation as a "maddie", best known among the electorate for a short temper and crude political invective. Along the way, the 43-year-old has reinvigorated an opposition meekly facing its fourth straight election defeat and won plaudits for forcing veteran strategist Prime Minister John Howard to run a defensive campaign responding to Labor's agenda. "He has achieved a great deal in just 10 months," the Sun-Herald newspaper said wrapping up Latham's successes as the campaign entered its final week. "He's transformed the fortunes of a moribund party and reset its course. "Over the past five weeks, he has proved a smart tactician, an engaging speaker and the closest thing we have seen to a conviction politician in a long time." Latham's political depth should have come as no surprise. The Labor leader has written or edited nine books on policy issues and Britain's respected Economist magazine has said "if elected, he will possibly be Australia's most intellectual prime minister". But Latham's qualities were previously overshadowed by intemperate outbursts which marked him out as erratic and inexperienced among voters. He referred to US leader George W. Bush as the "most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory" and in 2001 crash-tackled a taxi driver in a dispute over a fare, breaking the man's arm. Fiercely proud of his upbringing in the public housing estates of Sydney's tough western suburbs, Latham once decribed himself as a "hater", who loathed political conservatives. Latham publicly renounced crudity when he took over the Labor leadership and cultivated the image of a suburban family man, putting previously unheard of issues issues such as childhood obesity and the importance of parents reading to their offspring on the political agenda. His campaign has focused on health and education, rather than Howard's strengths of economic management and national security. Initiatives included a 2.9 billion dollar (2.03 billion US) pledge for free healthcare to the over 75s, in a bid to win votes from one of Howard's strongest support bases. Latham's emphasis on social issues has been credited with prompting Howard to announce generous measures on childcare, health and the environment, rather than simply relying solely on a "steady as she goes" pitch to the electorate. "(Latham) has grown in stature during the campaign, burying his reputation as an abrasive streetfighter and demonstrating his credentials as a credible and intelligent party leader," the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Relief in Indonesia as women hostages freed by Benito Lopulalan.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BANYUWANGI, Indonesia, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The impoverished husband of one of two Indonesian women freed by Iraqi kidnappers expressed relief Tuesday but said he would not stop his wife if she wanted to return to work in the war-hit country. Novitasari binti Sugito and Istiqomah binti Misnad, both from Indonesia's East Java province, were freed late Monday after a three-day ordeal. They had been captured soon after entering Iraq to work as maids. Shortly after hearing of his wife's release, Istiqomah's husband Sugianto said he was relieved and was looking forward to seeing her back in her home town of Banyuwangi. "Thank God, I hope she will be sent back home to Indonesia as soon as possible. If it's really true, I feel really grateful to any institutions that have helped to make this possible," Sugianto told AFP. However he said he would be powerless to prevent his wife returning to Iraq to seek more work to support their penniless family. "I hope she will not go again, but it depends on her. I would ask her to stay, but it would still depend on her will." Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa confirmed the two were in safe custody and were due to return home within four days. "The two Indonesian women are now in the protection of the United Arab Emirates' representative in Baghdad. We understand that they will shortly be taken out to Abu Dhabi and eventually be flown back home," Natalegawa told AFP. In Novitasari's city of Malang, her family also reacted jubilantly to news of her release. "After watching television, I am sure that she is my daughter," her father Sugito told the Jakarta Post newspaper. The two women were seized by a group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq, which demanded that Indonesia free radical Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir who is in prison awaiting trial for leading a regional terrorist group. Both Jakarta, a staunch critic of last year's US-led invasion of Iraq, and Bashir rejected the demands. Megawati Sukarnoputri, president of the world's largest Muslim country, also made a televised appeal for the women's freedom. The Doha-based Al-Jazeera channel said Monday that the group announced in a statement it had freed the hostages at Bashir's request. The two women appeared shocked after their experience but told AFP in Baghdad they were well treated by their captors. "They took us when we were on the road from Amman. They put us in a cell, but I don't know near which city it was. I was scared but they did us no harm and treated us well. Then they decided to release us," Novitasari told AFP. Istiqomah's husband Sugianto said his wife had set off for Iraq late last month after originally telling him she had found work in Jordan to support her impoverished family, including her young step-son. He described his wife as a religious woman who attended regular prayer meetings, saying he was at a loss to understand why she was kidnapped. "Istiqomah has no connection whatsoever with any kind of politics, she is just a worker." He said he was looking forward to seeing his wife again and felt no anger towards her kidnappers. "This is our fate. Everyone has destiny, it is part of God's will."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Anglo-Australian resources giant BHP Billiton on Tuesday announced a share buy-back of 1.0-1.5 billion dollars (720 million-1.08 billion US) as part of a capital restructure program. The buy-back is the first step in BHP Billion's plan to return two billion US dollars to shareholders over the next 12 months, which was announced in August on the back of a record 3.51 billion Australian dollar annual net profit. BHP Billiton said the price of the buy-back will be determined by a tender process and it could be expended if the response from investors is strong. "The company may buy back more if there is excess demand at an attractive price," it said in a statement. The company said the rest of the two billion US dollar program was yet to be finalised but could include a further share buy-back and or enhanced dividends. BHP Billiton chairman Don Argus said in a statement the return of capital is consistent with the company's commitment to demonstrating strong capital discipline while continuing to invest in organic growth. Argus said he did not expect non-Australian shareholders to participate because they were not eligible for tax credits available under the Australian system. Shareholders in the United States and Canada and holders of BHP Billiton American Depository Receipts (ADRs) will not be eligible to participate. BHP Billiton shares were up 19 cents or 1.3 percent at 14.94 dollars about midday in a rising overall Australian market.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri Tuesday urged her nation to accept results of the country's first full presidential vote but stopped short of conceding defeat to her former top security minister. "All sides should be able to receive (this) well, uphold the values of democracy and mutually respect each other," Megawati said a day after a final vote count officially handed victory to ex-general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. "We have to be able to show the world that our nation is a big nation and one of noble ethics," she said during a speech to mark Indonesia's armed forces day. Neither candidate in the September 20 polls has formally admitted defeat or accepted victory, although Yudhoyono has already begun preparations to build a cabinet for when he takes office later this month. The former general has said he would wait until Megawati conceded before addressing the nation. In her speech, Megawati hailed as a "major achievement for our nation" the three elections held in Indonesia this year, including two presidential voting rounds and April legislative polls. "We all, of course, hope that this big achievement can be sustained without being sullied by even a single stain, and it has become a new task and duty for us all to safeguard this." Indonesia's emergence as the world's third largest democracy comes just six years after former president Suharto was forced to stand down, ending three decades of authoritarian rule. "We can be proud that we have sucessfully laid the foundation for a more democratic and stable nation and state that will be more capable of overcoming the challenge of this century," she said, clearly holding back tears. Yudhoyono was also present at the armed forces day ceremony at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma airbase, but was sitting far removed from Megawati. Yudhoyono won 60.62 percent of the votes against Megawati's 39.38 percent.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Foreign Minister Alexander Downer declined Tuesday to reveal any timetable for a possible withdrawal of Australian troops from Iraq following a statement by Poland that it is aiming for a pullout by the end of next year. President Aleksander Kwasniewski said there had been no final decision on when to withdraw forces, but said Warsaw was considering the late 2005 deadline with the hopes that January elections in Iraq would bring stability to the country. Downer told reporters in Adelaide that Poland's proposed withdrawal date was a long way away and a lot of progress would have been made by then, but would not have any impact on troop numbers in the region. "It doesn't mean very much. It's a very long way away now," Downer said. He said only that Australian troops would remain in Iraq "until we finish the job". "I am not speculating on any time about when they would do the job," he added. Downer also released a letter from Iraqi deputy prime minister Barham Salih asking Australia to maintain its current level of troops, saying it showed Australia's Labor opposition would be wrong to withdraw the troops by Christmas, as it has pledged to do if it wins the October 9 election. "The letter from the acting prime minister makes the point and makes it very clear that for us to cut and run now would just be complete folly," he said. Poland last year took command of a multinational security force in central Iraq that currently includes about 6,000 troops - among them more than 2,400 Polish soldiers.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The US House of Representaives late Monday approved a measure urging the Chinese government to immediately stop hostile actions against the Falun Gong spiritual group both in China and the United States. The measure urges Beijing to "immediately stop interfering in the exercise of religious and political freedoms within the United States, such as the right to practice Falun Gong." It also wants the Chinese government to "cease using the diplomatic missions in the United States to spread falsehoods about the nature of Falun Gong," and to "release from detention all prisoners of conscience, including practitioners of Falun Gong," incarcerated in China. China should "immediately end the harassment, detention, physical abuse, and imprisonment of individuals who are exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of religion, including the practices of Falun Gong, freedom of expression, and freedom of association, as stated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China," according to the measure. It also wants Beijing to "demonstrate its willingness to abide by international standards of freedom of belief, expression, and association by ceasing to restrict those freedoms" in China. The House also wants President George W. Bush to issue "a formal protest" to the Chinese Foreign Ministry "in response to the repeated violations by the Chinese Government of basic human rights" in China. And the legislators want US Attorney General John Ashcroft to "investigate reports that Chinese consular officials in the United States have committed illegal acts while attempting to intimidate or inappropriately influence Falun Gong practitioners or local elected officials." Falun Gong once claimed millions of followers on mainland China, but has faced a tough crackdown by the government, which considers it one of the most serious threats to its rule. The group claims that at least 1,600 of its members have been tortured or beaten to death in China since a crackdown ordered four years ago largely drove the organisation underground.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGALORE, India, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[India have called up batting great Sunil Gavaskar to assist its out-of-form batsmen ahead of the Test series against world champions Australia starting on Wednesday. Gavaskar, the first batsman to score 10,000 runs who has a world record 34 Test centuries to his credit, agreed to a specific request by captain Sourav Ganguly to help the team in the highly-anticipated series. "I will be with the team for the entire series," Gavaskar, 54, told reporters here. "I want to talk to the boys at the nets on Tuesday and see what they want. I will take it from there." Indian batsmen have been in poor form this season which saw the 2003 World Cup finalists lose four successive limited-overs tournaments since August. Moreover, star batsman Sachin Tendulkar is sidelined for part of the series with a tennis elbow injury. Indian cricket board official Gautam Dasgupta said the request for Gavaskar had come from the team management after the Champions Trophy in England. "They wanted a cricket consultant and there could be no better choice than a person of Gavaskar's stature," he said. Gavaskar, the former Test captain who retired from international cricket in 1987 with 10,122 runs from 125 Tests, has kept in touch with the game as a television commentator and columnist. He also heads the International Cricket Council's technical committee and India's National Cricket Academy. Australia are aiming to win their first Test series on Indian soil since 1969. India won the last two series played here in 1998 and 2001 by identical 2-1 margins.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Kumble wants 400th wicket delayed for India's sake.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BANGALORE, India, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[India's Anil Kumble hopes to claim his 400th wicket on home turf when the first Test against Australia starts here on Wednesday - but preferably not on the opening day itself. The veteran leg-spinner is three wickets away from becoming the second Indian after Kapil Dev and the ninth in Test history to achieve the bowlers' version of climbing Mount Everest. "It would be great to get it in front of my home crowd," the 33-year-old Bangalore-based software engineer said. "But hopefully it will not come on the first day because I want India to bat first on this wicket." The bone-dry turf at the Chinnaswamy stadium, described by Australian coach John Buchanan as "terrible", is expected to favour Kumble and his spin twin Harbhajan Singh. "It is a slow wicket that will take a lot of spin," Kumble said. "We have always done very well at home. It is important to start well and the first test is always crucial. "When you come so close to a landmark, you want it out of the way as fast as possible. I don't want to linger on with it. "But for India's sake I hope we bat first." Kumble took his 300th wicket on the same ground three years ago against England, but had to endure an agonising wait till last man Matthew Hoggard came to the crease to take the solitary wicket he needed. The 84-Test veteran was overshadowed by young Harbhajan on Australia's last tour here in 2001 when the off-spinner took a staggering 32 wickets in three Tests to fashion India's 2-1 win. "It is great to bowl in tandem with Bhajji, we have had a lot of success together," Kumble said. "But I think the Australians will be better prepared this time to tackle spin. After all, they won 3-0 in Sri Lanka earlier this year." Australia, who have not won a series on Indian soil since 1969, lost five of the last seven Tests they have played here. Kumble was certain Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, who has struggled in India in the past, will bag the six wickets he needs to overtake Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan's world record tally of 532. "Shane is a wonderful ambassador of spin bowling, I am sure he will get the record in this series which he fully deserves," Kumble said. Warne, who has 527 wickets, has managed just 20 wickets in six Tests on Indian soil against what he considers the best players of spin bowling in the world. The 400-wicket club includes only eight bowlers so far: Muralitharan (532), Warne (527), Courtney Walsh (519), Glenn McGrath (440), Kapil Dev (434), Richard Hadlee (431), Wasim Akram (414) and Curtly Ambrose (405).]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Bob Dylan opens up. a little by Giles Hewitt.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[NEW YORK, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Bob Dylan's much anticipated autobiography hits US bookstores Tuesday, offering a rare, first-hand insight into the reclusive singer's life, the genesis of his career and struggle with celebrity. However, any fan seeking a sensational tell-all confessional in the style of most rock music memoirs will be sorely disappointed. "Chronicles: Volume One" wanders far from the normal autobiographical path, eschewing any chronological structure and providing instead snatches of a life, filled with anecdotes about anyone from the boxer Joe Dempsey to U2 frontman Bono. The non-indexed book is perhaps most notable for what it leaves out. There is nothing of his shocking switch from acoustic to electric sound, his conversion to Christianity, or the breakdown of his marriage to Sara Lowndes, which spawned the highly acclaimed 1975 album "Blood on the Tracks." His near-fatal motorbike crash in 1966 gets only the most cursory mention. "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered" he writes. The 293-page book is split into five chapters, three dealing with his early adult days in Minnesota and New York City, and two with the making of two of his lesser-known albums: "New Morning" (1970) and "Oh Mercy" (1989). The memoirs offer an atmospheric portrait of the Greenwich Village scene of the 1960s and the first rumblings of the social and political upheavals to come. "America was changing. I had a feeling of destiny and I was riding the changes," Dylan says, describing the germination of the counter-cultural persona that would define much of his career. "It wasn't that I was anti-popular culture or anything and I had no ambitions to stir things up. I just thought of mainstream culture as lame as hell and a big trick." Apart from music, the other subject that generates the most passionate passages in the book concern Dylan's discomfort with the intrusiveness that came with celebrity and attempts to pigeonhole him as the voice of a generation. At one point he recalls being awarded an honorary degree by Princeton University and being introduced to the student body as "the disturbed conscience of Young America." "Oh Sweet Jesus. It was like a jolt. The disturbed conscience of Young America. There it was again. I couldn't believe it. Tricked once more. I was so mad I wanted to bite myself." The annoyance spills into fury when recalling how hordes of fans would make the pilgrimage to his family home in Woodstock. "Roadmaps to our homestead must have been posted in all fifty state for gangs of dropouts and druggies. "I wanted to set fire to these people," he recollects. Celebrity crops up again in a Guinness-lubricated conversation in the late 1980s with Bono, who Dylan describes as having "the soul of an ancient poet." "We talked about fame and both agreed that the funny thing about fame is that nobody b had a full deck, and I cut the cards and whatever you see, go with that," he said. "I realise there's a great gap in it." An audio version of the book is also being brought out, read by the actor Sean Penn.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Singapore Airlines (SIA) said Tuesday it will sell its 6.3 percent stake in Air New Zealand, officially ending its costly venture in the now government-controlled carrier. SIA said it would place its 37,833,309 ordinary shares in Air New Zealand with investors, expecting to raise about 70 million New Zealand dollars (46.6 million US). "The decision by SIA to sell its Air NZ shares is consistent with its strategy to monetize non-core holdings," the carrier said in a statement. "(The sale) will not impact on various areas of co-operation between the two airlines which will continue into the future." Air New Zealand requested a halt in trading of its shares on the New Zealand and Australian stock exhanges until Wednesday morning to faciliate the tender. Air New Zealand shares closed in New Zealand on Monday at 1.68 New Zealand dollars. SIA initially took a 25 percent stake in Air New Zealand four years ago but lost millions after the New Zealand government was forced to bail out the troubled carrier and take majority ownership in 2001. SIA's stake was diluted to 6.3 percent in the recapitalisation. SIA's initial interest was sparked by Air New Zealand's stake in Australia's second major carrier, Ansett Airlines, which has since folded, as the Singapore carrier attempted to get into the Australian market. SIA shares were steady at 11.00 Singapore dollars (6.50 US) during morning Singapore trading on Wednesday but Oversea-China Banking Corp Research analyst Rohan Suppiah said the market should react positively to the news. "Overall, we view this development as positive as it frees up cash for the company," Suppiah said. "It is clear that SIA's strategic objectives in first purchasing the stake have not been realised and relinquishing the stake therefore changes nothing operationally." DBS Vickers aviation analyst Chris Sanda said SIA's announcement came as no surprise and was simply a move to rid itself of a "fairly passive" investment. "When you only have a 6.3 percent stake in something, selling seems more like a financial restructure," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BEIJING, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[China has warned that some its most economically important regions are facing a long and cold winter because of power shortages that now look all but unavoidable, state media said Tuesday. Shanghai, the country's largest city, and four provinces inluding export juggernauts Zhejiang and Fujian are likely to be affected, the China Daily reported, quoting Cheng Guangjie, vice president of the East China Power Grid. "There is simply not enough capacity to generate power in the country," the paper said, quoting unnamed engineers. As the weather gets cooler, the demand for heating will grow just when power plants are to shut down for maintenance, the paper said. China first reported failure to meet power demand in 2000, and the situation has deteriorated steadily since then. In 2004, energy shortfalls reached crisis levels, with a 30,000-megawatt shortage this summer, the worst since the 1980s. Many major power plants have run low on coal supplies due to transport bottlenecks and surging demand stemming from the country's rapid economic growth. A total of 24 provincial grids -- representing more than two-thirds of the country -- have been forced to restrict power supply in recent months. China predicts continued strong growth in energy demand for the rest of the decade as the economy keeps expanding. Power consumption is expected to reach 3.1 trillion kilowatt hours by 2010, up from 1.9 trillion kilowatt hours recorded in 2003.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KABUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Afghanistan is proud to have for the first presidential election in its history a female candidate, Masooda Jalal. But behind her Afghan women remain deprived of the most fundamental rights. Since the collapse of the Taliban regime in late 2001, many women say their lives have improved. "In comparison with the Taliban regime they are independent now," said Fatima Jailani, the head of civic education for women in southern Afghanistan, based in Kandahar. "You can see them out, going to schools, teaching, learning, working in offices like me." In Kabul, young girls in white headscarves and black uniforms gather in front of schools, while more and more women are swapping their azure blue burqas -- the all-covering head-to-toe cloak which symbolised their moral imprisonment under the Taliban -- for a simple headscarf. The constitution enshrines equal rights for men and women, within the confines of Islamic sharia law. They have the right to vote and 25 percent of seats in the future parliament. In fact 41 percent of the 10.5 million of voter registration cards issued have been to women. But beyond Kabul and certain northern cities, lies a sometimes brutal reality. According to a report published Sunday by the United Nations' agency for children, UNICEF, nearly 90 percent of women give birth at home and the rate of maternal mortality is one of the highest in the world. Seven out of 10 girls under 50 ignore all methods of contraception. Only 40 percent of girls aged seven to 12 are in school, the report found, and arranged marriages, in some instances forced, are still the rule. Some women are still imprisoned for choosing their husbands. Notably, across the country, women expressed a desperate need for security. "There is no human security," lamented Nilab Mubarez, one of three female vice presidential candidates for Saturday's vote. People are "imprisoned by fear," she said. "Fear of going out. Fear of not eating. Fear of being attacked for saying something wrong. "I cannot go out alone at night, because I am scared of being attacked by armed men," she said. Mubarez believed violence against women had become "banal" or commonplace. "People's heads have not stayed intact after all this violence. In the street, people tell us to 'get out of the way'. Before the war, they called us 'my sister'." The pressures and threats are endless. "Regional military factions and religious conservative leaders, as well as Taliban and other insurgent forces, are limiting Afghan women's participation in society through death threats, harassment, and physical attacks," said Human Rights Watch in a report on women's political rights, published Tuesday. "Sometimes men refuse to treat their women as adults, but sometimes it's the women themselves who unconsciously hold themselves back," Mubarez added. "We've come a long way, and there have been highs and lows, but Afghanistan was also one of the first countries in the world to have a woman senator, and the female vote in 1964," she said. For Mubarzez, it is women themselves who must decide to impose themselves, with the help of education programs and implementation of a state of law. In the wake of candidate Masooda.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korean credit card issuers, whose enormous losses have been a drag on the country's economy for two years, are turning around earlier than expected, according to a report Tuesday. The news immediately sent LG Card shares up 12.5 percent to trade 17,050 won (14.8 dollars). LG Card, the largest credit card issuer in this country, moved back into the black in September for the first time in two years, reaping a 10 billion won (8.7 million dollars) net profit, Internet news service MoneyToday said. LG Card reduced its monthly loss, which had been hovering around 100 billion won, to 20 billion won each in July and August. As a result, the company has cut a widely expected loss of 255 billion won for the three months to September to just 30 billion won, according to MoneyToday. A spokesman for LG Card declined to comment pending a general shareholders' meeting due at the end of October. Korea Development Bank and other creditors in January rescued LG Card from bankruptcy by granting it a two-trillion-won debt rollover and agreeing to convert their 3.5 trillion won in loans into equity in LG Card. Merrill Lynch Securities in August signed a deal with LG Card to invest 400 million dollars by purchasing its asset-backed securities. "Clients, who had left us en masse as late as last March, have since then been returning swiftly," a LG Card official was quoted as saying by MoneyToday. The company also underwent strict corporate restructuring, with LG employees vowing to not get into any labor disputes for this year at least. The company is expected to remain profitable throughout the fourth quarter to December, the LG Card official said. Samsung Card Co., another major credit card issuer, also successfully reduced its losses from an average 100 billion won over the first six months to 20 billion won in July and 16 billion won in August. Several other credit card issuers of the country are also expected to post between 40 and 70 billion won of losses for the third quarter, rasing hopes that they will be able to turn around in the fourth quarter, MoneyToday said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A Malaysian truck driver has been sentenced to a total of 93 years in prison and 58 strokes of the cane for committing incest with four daughters aged 14 to 20 years, newspapers reported Tuesday. The 40-year-old man pleaded guilty to forcing his daughters to have sex with him at the family home in Negeri Sembilan state south of Kuala Lumpur, the New Straits Times reported. The man, who was not named to protect the identity of his daughters, had already been sentenced last week to 73 years' jail and 46 strokes of the cane. He received the additional punishment after being convicted of a second charge of incest with one of the girls. Caning with a length of rattan, an extremely painful procedure which leaves lasting scars, is practised in countries like Malaysia and Singapore for men convicted of serious sexual crimes. The Star newspaper said that the convicted father would have to serve 54 years of his total prison sentence.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The US House of Representatives on Monday gave the government the green light to spend 20 million dollars a year for humanitarian aid to North Koreans inside and outside the country and moved to make North Korean refugees eligible for asylum in the United States. But the North Korean Human Rights Act, approved by voice vote, also contained four million dollars for expanding US radio broadcasts and other programs designed to promote democracy and human rights in the hermetic Stalinist nation. Last week, the Senate passed its own version of the bill which slightly differs from that approved by the House. But congressional officials said they saw no difficulty in reconciling the measures. Republican Representative James Leach of Iowa, the main sponsor of the bill, which covers the period to 2008, said he and other supporters of the package were driven by purely humanitarian considerations and had no hidden agendas. "It is not a pretext for a hidden strategy to provoke regime collapse or to seek collateral advantage in ongoing strategic negotiations," he stated. However, the bill contains language that appears to open the gates of American society to thousands of North Koreans interested in seeking asylum in the United States. It explicitly states that "North Koreans are not barred from eligibility for refugee status or asylum in the United States on account of any legal right to citizenship they may enjoy under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea." The action grew out of concern that more than two million North Koreans are estimated to have died of starvation since the early 1990s because of the failure of the country's government-controlled agricultural and public distribution systems. Hunger has forced thousands to seek refuge in neighbouring China. But US lawmakers expressed concern, in a preamble to the bill, that North Korean women and girls were "at risk of being kidnapped, trafficked, and sexually exploited inside China, where many are sold as brides or concubines, or forced to work as prostitutes." Since 1995, the United States has provided more than two million tonnes of humanitarian food assistance to North Koreans, primarily through the World Food Program, according to congressional officials.]]></c>

The accident happened on Saturday while the four children were trying to smash open a M79 artillery shell they had discovered on a hill in the Van Canh district of Binh Dinh province. Le Thi Tim, a 14-year-old girl, and Doan Van Diep, an 11-year-old boy, died on the spot while their two friends, aged 12 and 13, were hospitalized with extensive shrapnel injuries, a district policeman said. According to the US military, over 15 million tonnes of bombs, mines, artillery shells and other munitions were used during the Vietnam War. As much as 10 percent of the ordnance is estimated to have failed to explode. Since the war ended in 1975 more than 38,000 people have been killed and over 100,000 injured as a result of this unexploded ordnance, according to the Ministry of Public Security.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[China has employed state-of-the-art technology to determine how much is left of the Great Wall and which parts belong to which provinces, state media reported Tuesday. The remote sensor technology will enable the State Administration of Cultural Heritage to chart every inch of the 2,500 kilometers (1,560 miles) that still remains of the wall, the China Daily said. "Many of the truly ancient parts are scattered among the mountains, awaiting discovery and recording by scientists," the paper said. All the data collected in the survey will be included in a brand new database for the Great Wall that will be continuously updated with new information. The next step is to attract funds and volunteers to protect the wall section by section, according to the report. Many Chinese are alarmed at the gradual deterioration of the Great Wall due to neglect and over-exploitation by the tourism industry. The wall was listed on the United Nations' prestigious World Heritage List in 1987, but far from ensuring its preservation, critics said that shrouded the wall in a "false cloak of security".]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[HANOI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Vietnam's deputy trade minister has been ordered to write a letter of self-criticism over a corruption scandal that has resulted in the arrests of four ministry officials, including his son, state media said Tuesday. The Ministry of Trade's Communist Party leadership ruled Monday that Mai Van Dau, the most senior of four deputy trade ministers, had to take responsibility for corruption within the ministry's import-export department. Dau, who was in charge of approving export quotas for textiles bound for the United States, was instructed to write a letter criticising his role in the quota-allocation process, a common form of punishment in the communist nation. "We are waiting for an honest self-criticism from Dau. Then we will compare it with other sources to see how honest he really is," Minister of Trade Truong Dinh Tuyen told the Thanh Nien newspaper. State media on Saturday quoted Tuyen as saying that the 62-year-old Dau had "temporarily stopped working". Dau's son, Mai Thanh Hai, who worked in the import-export department, was arrested last week as part of the wide-ranging probe into the alleged selling of quotas to companies wishing to export garments to the United States. The textile sector is Vietnam's second biggest foreign exchange earner after crude oil, but clothing exports to the United States, its most important market, are capped by Washington. Le Van Thang, deputy director of the department, and another official were charged last month, while Nguyen Viet Phu, who also worked for the department, was arrested Monday, the Thanh Nien said. Eight Vietnamese businessmen have also been arrested for their alleged involvement in the scam. The government's reputation has been badly tarnished over the past year by a series of damaging graft scandals. In June agriculture minister Le Huy Ngo was sacked over a big corruption case implicating a ministry-controlled company, whose director was sentenced to death. The communist regime has vowed to punish corrupt officials within its ranks, but critics say the crackdown is highly selective and some high-ranking cadres have acquired de facto immunity from prosecution.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two leading Indonesian anti-corruption groups Tuesday urged the country's next president to get tough on the country's endemic graft, adopting measures such as witness protection schemes to aid the fight. In an open letter advertisement placed in the Koran Tempo paper, Indonesian Corruption Watch and Transparency International Indonesia hailed Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's election victory and offered a one-year anti-graft agenda. It said the new government should use an "extraordinary crime" approach to combat corruption, reviewing current laws, adopting the "burden of proof" system and enshrining freedom of information as well as safeguarding witnesses. "The eradication of corruption should be an inherent part of the wider reform process that includes the restoration of the economy, the reform of public services and the reform of the bureaucracy," the letter said. Yudhoyono, who was this week declared winner of September 20 presidential polls after beating incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri, campaigned on a ticket of economic restructuring and combating Indonesia's widespread graft. Corruption is seen as a major disincentive to badly-needed foreign investment, without which Indonesia has struggled to keep up with its neighbours in recovering from the 1997-98 regional financial crisis. The letter said Yudhoyono, who takes office on October 20, must move swiftly to install well-qualified and "clean" ministers and senior officials, to set a strong example and rebuild public confidence. A survey of expatriate businesspeople this year by the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy showed Indonesia has the worst reputation for graft in Asia.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Communist rebels in the Philippines vowed on Tuesday to step up attacks against the government and urged those dissatisfied with President Gloria Arroyo's administration to join them. The underground Communist Party of the Philippines had ordered its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), to "launch bigger, more numerous and more frequent tactical offensives on isolated elements of the reactionary armed forces and police every time the opportunity presents itself," rebel spokesman Gregorio Rosal said. "The NPA will intensify its tactical offensives to accelerate the overthrow of the US-Arroyo regime," Rosal said in a statement. He said anyone willing to join the rebellion would be welcomed in the NPA's 128 guerrilla fronts scattered in the countryside. The rebels also branded Arroyo a puppet of the United States, the Philippines' leading economic and military ally. The 8,600-strong NPA and its political leadership have been waging a campaign against the government for 35 years. While the military acknowledges a "steady rise in guerrilla fronts" operated by the NPA in the countryside in recent years, the rebels' strength has dropped significantly from a high of 25,000 in 1987, with infighting among its leaders contributing to the decline. The communists suspended peace talks with Arroyo's government in August, saying that Manila had failed to persuade the United States and European countries to remove them from their lists of international terrorists.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Crude oil climbed back past 50 US dollars a barrel in Asian trade Tuesday, with the market focusing again on the likelihood of continued strong underlying demand in China and the United States, dealers said. At 12:40 pm (0440 GMT), New York's light sweet, crude contract for November delivery was at 50.19 US dollars barrel, up from 49.91 dollars at the close in New York on Monday. Prices had eased below the 50-dollar mark after rival Nigerian rebels in the oil-rich Niger Delta agreed to a ceasefire over the weekend, easing concerns about a possible major supply disruption to the United States. Victor Shum, a Singaporean-based senior partner with US energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz, said that the "fundamentals" of high global demand would continue to keep prices near or above current levels. "From day to day we are going to see some volatility but the fact that China demands remains strong, United States' demand remains strong, means that prices are going to stay at this historical high end," Shum said. "Prices are going to remain high for the next month and well into next year."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[China warns of 'ecological catastrophe' from Tibet's melting glaciers.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BEIJING, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An "ecological catastrophe" is developing in Tibet because of global warming, and most glaciers in the region could have melted away by 2100 if no efficient measures are taken, state media said Tuesday. The stark message is the result of surveys performed by a group of 20 scientists from China and the United States over a 40-month period, the China Daily reported. "The full-scale glacier shrinkage in the plateau region will eventually lead to an ecological catastrophe," Yao Tangdong, China's foremost glaciologist, said according to the paper. Tibet's glaciers have been receding over the past four decades due to global warming, but the alarming development has picked up rapidly especially since the early 1990s, the paper said. The joint Sino-US scientific team said it discovered a number of separated ice island at levels above 7,500 meters (25,000 feet) from sea level that used to be connected with the glaciers. If global warming continues at its current pace, most of the plateau's glaciers will have disappeared from the face of the Earth by the turn of the next century, he warned. Yao has emerged as a main proponent for tougher measures to protect Tibet's glaciers. He was quoted in the state media this summer as saying global warming was causing China's highland glaciers, including those covering Mount Everest, to shrink by an amount equivalent to all the water in the Yellow River - China's second biggest - every year. A potential silver lining in the form of additional water for China's arid north and west has not materialized, according to earlier reports. Much of the melted glacier water vaporizes long before it reaches the country's drought-stricken farmers and again global warming is to blame. Yao previously also told local media that as many as 64 percent of China's glaciers may be history by 2050 if current trends continue. The human cost could be immense, since 300 million Chinese live in the country's arid west and depend on water from the glaciers for their survival.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MELBOURNE, Australia, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An Australian court sentenced a US man Tuesday to more than three years in jail for killing a fellow American traveller in a freak drunk driving collision. Blaine Miller, a 42-year-old from Athens, Georgia, pleaded guilty to driving drunk, jet-lagged and exhausted when he smashed head-on into a motorcycle ridden by another US national, Henry Skokowski, early this year. Skokowski, a 55-five-year-old holidaymaker from Palm Beach, Florida, died as he was being airlifted from the scene of the Valentines Day crash on the Great Ocean Road, a popular tourist route along Australia's southeast coast. The court heard Miller had three previous convictions for drunken driving in 1979, 1981 and 1987 and had medication with him designed to prevent him from drinking, but had not been taking the medicine since arriving in Australia 35 hours before the crash. Miller, an engineer with rice cracker manufacturer Sakata, was beginning a 10-day working tour of Australia. Victorian County Court judge Peter Gebhardt on Tuesday sentenced Miller to three years and three months jail with a minimum term of 19 months. Miller has already served seven months in jail since the accident.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An emotional Megawati Sukarnoputri on Tuesday urged Indonesia to accept the results of landmark polls which delivered a landslide victory to her former security minister, clearing his path to the presidency. Her speech, made to mark Indonesia's armed forces day, was the closest to conceding defeat Megawati has come since officials results released a day earlier declared Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono the victor of the elections. "All sides should be able to accept (this) well, uphold the values of democracy and mutually respect each other," Megawati said. "We have to be able to show the world that our nation is a big nation and one of noble ethics," she said, visibly choking back tears. Yudhoyono, who will be sworn in as Indonesia's sixth president on October 20, has so far declined to deliver a formal acceptance speech, saying he would wait until Megawati had made her declaration. The retired general, who won 60.62 percent of the votes against Megawati's 39.38 percent, was also present at the armed forces day ceremony at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma air base, but was sitting far removed from his predecessor. Speaking to journalists after the ceremony, he avoided direct comment on the election result, instead praising Megawati's address. In her speech, the outgoing president hailed as a "major achievement for our nation" the three elections held in Indonesia this year, including two presidential voting rounds and April legislative polls. "We all, of course, hope that this big achievement can be sustained without being sullied by even a single stain, and it has become a new task and duty for us all to safeguard this," she said. A spokesman for Indonesia's Constitutional Court said there had been no official challenges by early Tuesday to the result of the elections, which were praised as free and fair by international observers. Indonesia's emergence as the world's third largest democracy comes just six years after former president Suharto was forced to stand down, ending three decades of authoritarian rule. "We can be proud that we have successfully laid the foundation for a more democratic and stable nation and state that will be more capable of overcoming the challenge of this century," Megawati said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KABUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Donkeys, camels, trucks and aircraft fanned out around Afghanistan's wild landscape Tuesday, carrying ballot boxes and troops ahead of historic presidential elections on Saturday. Nearly 60,000 Afghan police and soldiers backed by 27,000 international troops were moving into position at 5,000 polling stations in anticipation of attacks by insurgents who have threatened to disrupt the vote. "The face of security on the day will be Afghan," said John McComber, head of security for the UN-backed electoral commission. "International military will be backup and filling in the holes. The enemy has the advantage of choosing the time and place of attacks and looking for weak points. We aim for there not to be any weak points." Officials have warned of a possible sharp spike in attacks around polling day, with major cities at risk of car-bomb blasts and polling stations under threat of armed assault. "We know what the enemy wants to do but we still don't know what they are capable of doing," McComber said. Hundreds of people have been killed this year in an insurgency by militants of the former hardline Islamic Taliban regime, ousted by a US-led invasion after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on New York and Washington. Twelve electoral workers have been killed and 33 injured. Some 120,000 staff have been hired for the election, and supervisors are busy training local officials who will man the ballot stations, said Julian Type, an advisor to the UN-backed Afghan electoral commission. Once the vote is completed at dusk on October 9, electoral staff will begin transporting ballot boxes to eight regional counting centers, with initial results expected to be released daily from October 11, Type said. However, if a single candidate appears unable to garner more than 50 percent of the vote and a run-off election is called, the election commission will delay the announcement of the final result until November 6, Type said. US-backed interim President Hamid Karzai, who was installed after the invasion, is widely expected to win the elections against 17 other candidates, with his main challenge coming from former education minister Yunus Qanooni.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WELLINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[New Zealand share prices closed little changed Tuesday, with the fallout from the offer for Powerco continuing to dominate trade, dealers said. The NZSX50 gross index was up 2.71 points or 0.09 percent at 2,860.82 on turnover of 97 million New Zealand dollars (66 million US dollars). While the headline gain was small, turnover remained firm, Matt Willis of Amro Craigs Equities said. "There's no doubt about it; in general terms volumes are well and truly up for September and look to be for the start of this month as well. It still feels like we've got a reasonably buoyant environment for equities," Willis said. Powerco continued to feature, with the stock up four cents at 2.12 dollars. Late Monday, New Plymouth District Council, Powerco's major stock holder, said it had secured a deal-saving agreement with Australia's Prime Infrastructure, guaranteeing its request for a mix of cash and bonds as payment for its Powerco stake. Meanwhile local minority shareholders continued to sell their Powerco shares to offshore funds and the stock was the most heavily traded on the day. "It's certainly providing some impetus in the market," Willis said. Market leader Telecom gained two cents to 6.01 dollars. Willis said the weakening New Zealand dollar and the company's "compelling dividend story" were creating some renewed offshore interest in the telco. Carter Holt Harvey was down three to 2.30 dollars and Contact Energy was up five cents to 6.08 dollars. Auckland International Airport lost nine cents to 7.06 dollars, its second day of losses after media reports over the weekend that the government was set approve a second international airport for Auckland at Whenuapai. Air New Zealand was suspended after Singapore Airlines said it was selling its 6.5 percent stake in the airline. Air New Zealand last traded Monday at 1.68 dollars.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korea has prepared secret plans to take control of North Korea and to accommodate at least 200,000 refugees in the event of the sudden collapse of the communist regime, a news report said Tuesday. The JoongAng Ilbo, a major Seoul daily, said that under the secret plans disclosed at a parliamentary audit on Monday Seoul's unification minister would take over as ruler of post-collapse North Korea. South Korea has also designated public facilities such as schools and stadiums nationwide to house more than 200,000 North Koreans expected to flood towards the south if the communist regime lurched towards collapse, the JoongAng reported said. South Korea's military has also set up 10 refugee camps to house North Korean defectors near the inter-Korean border, it said. The newspaper said the contingency plans concerning the collapse of North Korea were initially drawn up in 1994 when the founder of the Stalinist state, Kim Il-Sung, died. They have since been updated. Many officials and experts predicted the imminent collapse of North Korea at the time. However, fears eased with the successful transfer of power from Kim to his son, Kim Jong-Il, and North Korea has since survived serious famine and natural disasters in the mid-1990s and a deepening standoff with the outside world over its nuclear weapons ambitions. Seoul's unification ministry refused to comment on the newspaper report and said that the parliamentary discussions on the plans were confidential. Two separate contingency plans were discussed in the parliamentary hearing at the request of an opposition Grand National Party lawmaker, the newspaper said. Under one plan, code-named "Chungmu 9000," South Korea would establish an emergency administrative headquarters in North Korea following the collapse of the communist regime. South Korea's unification minister would head the agency and would dispose of powers greater than a governor, according to the newspaper. Under a separate "Chungmu 3300" plan, South Korea would prepare for a massive influx of refugees and would also evacuate any South Koreans from the North.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa said Tuesday it has cut the price for the initial public offering (IPO) of its telecom assets. The ports-to-telecoms company, owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, said it will cut its indicative price range for Hutchsion Telecommunications International Ltd. (HTIL), to 6.01-7.04 Hong Kong dollars (77-90 US cents) a share from the previous 6.52-7.55 Hong Kong dollars. The company is offering 1.155 billion shares, which would raise between 6.9 billion and 8.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (1.04 billion US). The company had originally hoped to raise 1.13 billion US dollars. Hutchison did not give a reason for reducing the offer price and only said that its global coordinator, Goldman Sachs, had advised it to do so. Some 115.5 million shares will be sold to the Hong Kong public, while the company will sell 69.3 million American Depositary shares (ADS), equivalent to 1.04 billion shares or 90 percent of the offering overseas. Hutchison said the final IPO price will be fixed on October 7. The ADS will list in New York on October 14 and the shares in Hong Kong on October 15. Hutchison will remain HTIL's majority shareholder with a 75 percent stake following the IPO.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A 10-year-old Thai girl died after her throat was allegedly repeatedly slashed by her mother, grandmother and two aunts in a ritual to rid her of an evil spirit, police said Tuesday. Prapasorn Jiamcharoen was found dead in a pool of blood with multiple slash wounds to her neck as the women chanted upstairs to a Hindu goddess they had built a cult around, police said. "We suspected they committed the crime in a trance-like state without even knowing what they have done," Police Colonel Surachai Kuandechakupt told AFP. He said the women had used a meat cleaver to hack at Prapasorn's throat and hair -- which was ceremonially soaked in a bowl -- before burning the girl's clothes and mattress. Surachai said the women raged at the police who arrested them and accused them of ruining the ceremony at the family home in Ratchaburi province southwest of Bangkok. The family had boasted of their ability to contact gods and spirits to neighbours, who told police they were too scared to associate with the family, the Bangkok Post reported. About 95 percent of Thais are Buddhist but a strong animist tradition remains, with "spirit doctors" who say they can help people get rid of curses and ghosts widespread across the country.]]></c>

Six of the seven people who died last week in the Delta region were children, a disaster relief official from An Giang province said. The area is prone to seasonal flooding which often causes widespread devastation and loss of human life. In 2002 around 170 people, the majority of them children, died from severe flooding in the region. Meanwhile, heavy rains pummeled the central province of Quang Nam late last week, triggering flash floods that swept three motorcyclists to their deaths on Sunday.

Japan's biggest LCD panel maker said it is considering the release of LCD TVs of 50-inches and larger in the year to March 2006.

LCDs and PDPs are competing flat-screen technologies. "Such a quantum leap in screen size -- well beyond the 45-inch size that many thought was the limit for LCDs -- shows that LCD technology still has plenty of room to evolve and grow," the company said. Sharp estimates global demand for color TVs at 130 million in the current year to March 2005, of which 7.5 million will be LCD units.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Former Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday downplayed the chances of a political comeback by his ex-protege-turned rival Anwar Ibrahim, who was freed last month after six years in jail on corruption charges. Speaking before a business conference in Manila, Mahathir said that Anwar's acquittal on appeal against a sodomy conviction was merely on a technicality and the courts had not specifically cleared him of charges of homosexuality -- a crime in mainly Muslim Malaysia. "The acquittal was on very flimsy ground. We are not worried by him," Mahathir said, adding that the police who handled the case apparently made a mistake on the date that the supposed crime was committed. "The acquittal does not mean he did not commit this." He said that under Malaysian law, Anwar would not be allowed to stand for any elective or party post for five years. "He would have the support outside the country, but outside the country, they are not our constituents," the former Malaysian premier said. Anwar had already been barred from rejoining the all-powerful United Malays National Organization (UMNO) at a party congress last month. Anwar was largely expected to become Malaysia's prime minister until he had a falling out with Mahathir in 1998. He was replaced by Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who this year succeeded Mahathir as prime minister. Malaysia's Federal Court last month overturned Anwar's conviction and nine-year sentence for sodomy. But the same court rejected an appeal to further review his corruption conviction, which accused him of abusing power to cover up allegations of sexual misconduct. The decision meant any political comeback would have to be delayed until 2008 under regulations governing convicted criminals. In an interview with AFP last month in Munich where he was seeking medical treatment for spinal problems, Anwar said he has made no commitment to join any political party but is likely to play a role in a multi-party alliance, probably in opposition. He said he wanted to reform the Malaysian government from what he called corruption and bigotry of its past. Anwar said he wanted to improve the country's democracy, encourage a more independent judiciary and make more positive economic changes that would generate faster growth and inject new political confidence.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Philippine share prices closed 0.99 percent lower Tuesday in a technical correction after the market rose to a 55-month high on Monday and with investors concerned that rising inflation could lead to higher interest rates, dealers said. The market failed to hold onto early gains but a continued rally in heavyweight Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) limited losses. The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index shed 18.25 points to 1,833.35 after trading between 1,829.84 and 1,865.64. Volume was 1.77 billion shares worth 1.24 billion pesos (22.4 million dollars) after 1.54 billion shares worth 1.56 billion pesos on Monday. The broader all-shares index was down 10.87 points at 1,117.92. Losers outnumbered gainers 48 to 34, with 45 stocks unchanged. The market opened 40 minutes late Tuesday due to technical glitches. "The market is correcting and is likely to remain in consolidation mode in the next session although the bullish sentiment remains intact," said Gomer Tan of Regina Capital Development Corp. "Investors will naturally be tempted to cash in on those (recent sharp) gains and re-assess their positions before preparing for the next wave of buying," said Mark Alan Canizares of Citiseconline.com. Inflation accelerated to 7.2 percent in September, pushing the inflation rate above the government target for the year as costs rose across the board, official figures showed Tuesday. In August, inflation ran at 6.8 percent. The National Statistics Office said inflation on an annualised basis was running at 5.2 percent, higher than government's full-year target of 4.0-5.0 percent. Dealers said the inflation figures raised concerns the central bank might have to hike interest rates but noted that strong export figures for August may have helped steady nerves. PLDT was top-traded and closed up five pesos at 1,470. Globe Telecom shed 35 pesos to 1,140. San Miguel Corp. saw its B shares, available to foreign investors, gaining 50 centavos to 71.50 pesos but the A shares, limited to locals, fell one peso to 57.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun went into talks with Indian leaders here Tuesday which officials said were aimed at concluding a slew of bilateral agreements and bolstering economic ties. Roh, who arrived in New Delhi on Monday for a three-day visit, kicked off his official engagements with a ceremonial welcome early Tuesday at the presidential palace attended by Indian President Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Foreign Minister Natwar Singh and other ministers. Roh's first scheduled meeting was with Natwar Singh. It was to be followed by talks with the premier, after which the two countries were to sign a series of pacts, including an extradition treaty and visa waiver for diplomats and government officials. Speaking to reporters after the welcome ceremony, Roh said he was "deeply impressed with (India's) deep blue skies" and the "beautiful scenery filled with green." The large number of Koreans in India were "full of hope and expectations about (India's economic) future," he said. South Korea is the fifth biggest investor in India after the United States, Mauritius, Britain and Japan, according to official data. Trade between India and South Korea in the fiscal year ended March 2004 grew 48 percent to 3.21 billion dollars over the previous year. The balance of trade stood in South Korea's favour at 1.7 billion dollars, according to official Indian figures. Roh, on the first trip by a South Korean president to India in eight years, is accompanied by a 15-member delegation including Seoul's ministers of foreign affairs, trade, commerce, industry and energy and information and communication, an official said. In an interview with an Indian newspaper Monday, the Korean leader said he would seek to "strengthen cooperative relations in information, communications, infrastructure, textiles and automobiles". "In particular, we seek to jointly advance into third nations by maximising on the synergy between India's software sector and Korea's IT industry," he said. It was, Roh said, "necessary to positively weigh the benefits of a Korean-Indian Free Trade Area (FTA) in order to provide institutional back-up for bilateral economic exchanges." "Experts say that considering our complementary industry structures and economic ties, an FTA would be a win-win situation for both countries," he said. News reports here said Roh could ask his Indian hosts to expedite clearances for South Korean steel firm POSCO, which has been trying to set up a plant in the eastern state of Orissa. POSCO -- in collaboration with Australian company BHP Billiton -- had put forward the proposal two months ago with a planned total investment of over eight billion dollars, the Indian Express reported at the weekend.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Vice President Dick Cheney will square off with his Democratic rival John Edwards in a televised debate Tuesday that suddenly takes on importance for the Republicans after George W. Bush's tepid showing last week. Political analysts agree that vice presidential debates, which go back to 1976, usually have little impact on the race for the White House since voters cast their ballots strictly for the man at the top. But the stakes will be higher in Tuesday's encounter in the midwestern city of Cleveland, coming five days after Bush suffered a clear defeat at the hands of Senator John Kerry in the first of their three debates. Republicans said Cheney would seek to repair the damage from the Democrat's relentless attacks on the Iraq war and renew the focus on Bush's leadership after the September 11, 2001 de shows to the campaign. retired vice admiral James Stockdale, the running mate of independent candidate Ross Perot in 1992, famously asked in his opening statement: "Who am I. Why am I here." But one of the few debates to make a difference might have been Cheney's 2000 meeting with Senator Joseph Lieberman, where he was able to reassure voters of the Republican ticket's depth and gravitas. A poll released Monday by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that Edwards had a better image among voters than Cheney. Thirty-eight percent rated him favorably and 31 percent unfavorably; 37 percent had a positive view of Cheney and 42 percent were negative. Meanwhile, Bush and Kerry battled Monday over science, taxes and Iraq, as the spotlight of their newly tight race shifted to their running mates' only televised debate. After signing legislation extending tax cuts, Bush said in the key up-for-grabs state of Iowa that Kerry would raise taxes on the US middle class and out of concern over the administration's foreign policy. Meanwhile, Bush redoubled his efforts to discredit Kerry as a potential commander in chief, pointing to the senator's vote against the 1991 Gulf War to oust Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. "The policies of my opponent are dangerous for world peace. If they were implemented they would make this world not more peaceful, but more dangerous," Bush told cheering supporters in Clive, Iowa. Kerry was joined in the eastern city of Hampton, New Hampshire by actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, as he blasted Bush's decision to limit publicly funded research using stem cells from human embryos.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[US House OKs humanitarian aid, asylum rights, for North Koreans by Maxim Kniazkov (ADDS details, background).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The US House of Representatives has given the government the green light to spend 20 million dollars to provide humanitarian aid to North Koreans inside and outside the country, and moved to make refugees from the country eligible for asylum in the United States. But the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, which was approved by voice vote Monday and covers a four-year period through fiscal 2008, also contained four million dollars for expanding US radio broadcasts and other programs designed to promote democracy and human rights in the hermetic Stalinist nation. Last week, the Senate passed its own version of the bill that slightly differs from that approved by the House. But congressional officials said they saw no difficulty in reconciling the measures. Republican Representative James Leach of Iowa, the main sponsor of the bill, said he and other supporters of the package were driven by purely humanitarian considerations and had no hidden agendas. "It is not a pretext for a hidden strategy to provoke regime collapse or to seek collateral advantage in ongoing strategic negotiations," he stated. However, the bill contains language that appears to open the gates of American society to thousands of North Koreans interested in seeking asylum in the United States. It explicitly states that "North Koreans are not barred from eligibility for refugee status or asylum in the United States on account of any legal right to citizenship they may enjoy under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea." The House also specifically refused to automatically consider North Korean nationals as citizens of South Korea. While offering needy North Koreans a helping hand, both the House and Senate loaded their bills with caveats designed to enhance US and international control over distribution of food and other products inside North Korea. They insisted on strict monitoring "to minimize the possibility that such assistance could be diverted to political or military use." They said assistance should be conditioned upon substantial improvements in transparency, monitoring and access to vulnerable populations throughout North Korea and barred outright any aid unless the US government certifies to Congress that Pyongyang had met these requirements. The action grew out of concern that more than two million North Koreans are estimated to have died of starvation since the early 1990s because of the failure of the country's government controlled agricultural and public distribution systems. Hunger has forced thousands to seek refuge in neighboring China. But lawmakers expressed concern, in a preamble to the bill, that North Korean women and girls were "at risk of being kidnapped, trafficked, and sexually exploited inside China, where many are sold as brides or concubines, or forced to work as prostitutes." Since 1995, the United States has provided more than two million tonnes of humanitarian food assistance to North Koreans, primarily through the World Food Program, according to congressional officials. The congressional action came as the crisis over North Korea and its nuclear ambitions was propelled to the forefront of the US election campaign last week, when Democratic challenger John Kerry accused President George W. Bush, during a nationally televised debate, of missing opportunities by shying away from direct dialogue with Pyongyang. Bush countered by saying his six-party formula for talks with North Korea had been effective because it had brought Beijing into the equation and "China's leverage on Kim Jong-Il" was key.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[John Howard has come a very long way since he famously quipped after being ousted from leadership of Australia's Liberal Party that a comeback would be "like Lazarus with a triple by-pass". That was in 1989, the low point of a 30-year parliamentary career, after a disunited Liberal-National coalition had been in opposition for six years. But the Liberals turned to him again in 1995, he led the coalition back to back to power the following year after 13 years in opposition, and on Saturday he will try for a fourth term as prime minister. Victory would ensure John Winston Howard, 65, passes former Labor leader Bob Hawke as Australia's second longest serving prime minister -- trailing only behind his political idol and Liberal Party founder, Sir Robert Menzies, who governed from 1949 to 1966. The man seen by many as the most conservative Australian leader ever has been in office eight and a half years and claims credit for creating a so-called miracle economy that has given people a feeling of prosperity they had not enjoyed for a generation. Howard has proven a tenacious and bold political warrior, staring down often bitter opposition to tighten gun control laws, shake up labour relations and reform the taxation system by imposing an initially unpopular sales tax. He sent his troops into harm's way four times: to East Timor to stop a massacre of pro-independence supporters in 1999, to Afghanistan to help oust the Taliban in 2001, to Iraq last year as part of the US-led coalition and to the Solomon Islands to restore the rule of law. But many analysts believe that, if not for his record as an economic manager, Howard would now be facing certain rejection by voters. And even if he wins, Howard is expected to retire before his three-year term ends, handing over to his heir-designate, Treasurer Peter Costello. Howard made his political comeback in the early 90s as "Honest John", a figure who may not have gained voters' affection in the same way as Hawkes and Menzies, but instead earned their trust and respect with a no nonsense approach to government management. Ironically the issue of Howard's truthfulness emerged as his weakest point of this election campaign. Like his counterparts in Britain and the United States, Howard has been plagued by claims of dishonesty over the justification he used to commit Australian troops to war in Iraq. He has also had to counter evidence he knowingly misled voters by repeating claims asylum seekers threw their children overboard while trying to reach Australia by boat in 2001, an issue that played a key role in his reelection that year. Many voters, including former Liberal diehards, have also not forgiven the monarchist Howard for blocking an Australian republic in an intensely fought referendum in 1999. More were bitterly disappointed over his refusal to apologise to the "stolen generations" of Aboriginal children separated by authorities from their parents and put into foster homes where many were abused. But Howard has learned during much of his life to live with unpopularity. The Sydney Morning Herald recalled recently that Howard could not even win enough votes at Sydney's Canterbury Boys High School to become one of the 25 prefects. One of three sons of a conservatively-minded garage proprietor, Howard grew up in the middle-class Sydney suburb of Earlwood. Former teachers and classmates thought of him as industrious, ambitious, tenacious, "a bit of a character" and a good debater. But popularity eluded him.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Six new faces in injury-hit Aussie squad for Confed Cup qualifiers.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Australia on Tuesday added six new members to a revised 20-man squad for its two Confederations Cup qualifiers against the Solomon Islands after injuries sidelined five key players. The newcomers were forwards Archie Thompson (Lierse), Ante Milicic (Pahang) and Max Vieri (Ternana), plus defenders Steve Laybutt (Gent), Jon McKain (National Bucharest) and Luke Wilshire (Bristol City). They were drafted in to replace the injured Middlesbrough striker Mark Viduka, skipper Craig Moore of Glasgow Rangers and midfielders Marco Bresciano of Parma, Everton's Tim Cahill and Leicester City's Danny Tiatto. Crystal Palace central defender Tony Popovic will however be fit to play after coming through a match overnight against Fulham. A Socceroos coach Frank Farina confirmed that Liverpool's Harry Kewell will also make a rare national appearance despite a groin injury which has restricted his season -- and his travel -- so far. "He has definitely still got a problem but that is something left to the medical staff," Farina said. In the absence of Moore, Farina has three captaincy candidates in Josip Skoko, Mark Schwarzer and Tony Vidmar, with Middlesbrough goalkeeper Schwarzer having already led the team against Turkey in May and at the Nations Cup preliminaries in June. Farina said he was leaning towards using the attacking three-striker formation he tried out with Australia's team at the Athens Olympics rather than the Socceroos' standard four-four-two formation. "(The forwards) are not static, they are free to move and all three strikers will end up in different parts of the park at different periods of the match," Farina said. "We are very comfortable with playing four across the middle of the park but I think they will be comfortable with (three-three-four). At the Olympics the guys adjusted to it very well." The three forward line-up will likely see Kewell up front alongside John Aloisi with the remaining berth contested between Mile Sterjovski and the three replacement forwards. After Saturday's match in Honiara the two sides meet October 12 in Sydney, with the winner of the series qualifying for next year's Confederations Cup in Germany. Australian squad: John Aloisi (Osasuna/SPA), Simon Colosimo (Pahang/MAS), Ahmad Elrich (Busan I Cons/KOR), Brett Emerton (Blackburn Rovers/ENG), Vince Grella (Parma/ITA), Zeljko Kalac (Perugia/ITA), Harry Kewell (Liverpool/ENG), Steve Laybutt (KAA Ghent/BEL), Jon McKain (National Bucuresti/ROM), Ante Milicic (Pahang/MAS), Kevin Muscat (Millwall/ENG), Lucas Neill (Blackburn Rovers/ENG), Tony Popovic (Crystal Palace/ENG), Mark Schwarzer (Middlesbrough/ENG), Josip Skoko (Genclerbirligi/TUR), Mile Sterjovski (Basel/SWI), Archie Thompson (Lierse/BEL), Tony Vidmar (Cardiff City/WAL), Max Vieri (Ternana/ITA), Luke Wilkshire (Bristol City/ENG).]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Eight leftist rebels slain in northern Philippines (RECASTS with military raid).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Eight communist guerrillas have been slain in a military raid in the northern Philippines, the army said Tuesday. Acting on a tip-off, an infantry unit attacked a suspected New People's Army (NPA) safehouse near the town of Penaranda on Saturday, sparking five hours of skirmishes with the retreating guerrillas, an army statement said. The bodies of eight guerrillas were recovered. No government casualties were reported. Communist rebels vowed on Tuesday to step up attacks against the government and urged those dissatisfied with President Gloria Arroyo's administration to join them. The Communist Party of the Philippines had ordered its armed wing, the NPA, to "launch bigger, more numerous and more frequent tactical offensives on isolated elements of the reactionary armed forces and police every time the opportunity presents itself," rebel spokesman Gregorio Rosal said. "The NPA will intensify its tactical offensives to accelerate the overthrow of the US-Arroyo regime," Rosal said in a statement. He said anyone willing to join the rebellion would be welcomed in the NPA's 128 guerrilla fronts scattered in the countryside. The 8,600-strong NPA and its political leadership have been waging a campaign against the government for 35 years. While the military acknowledges a "steady rise in guerrilla fronts" operated by the NPA in the countryside in recent years, the rebels' strength has dropped significantly from a high of 25,000 in 1987, with infighting among its leaders contributing to the decline. The communists suspended peace talks with Arroyo's government in August, saying that Manila had failed to persuade the United States and European countries to remove them from their lists of international terrorists. Arroyo on Tuesday blamed communist and Muslim separatist insurgencies and the high jobless rate for hunger and poverty in the Philippines. "We cannot shut our eyes to the truth of hunger and poverty. The immediate causes are unemployment in the cities, and pockets of conflict in the countryside," she said in a written statement. Military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Daniel Lucero said "the armed forces is capable" of meeting the threat of increased rebel attacks. "We are confident that the Filipino people will not allow the communists, the NPAs from taking the freedom that our forefathers have fought for," he told reporters. "We are taking the battle in their area, we will not wait for any other threats," he said. "They would like to portray that they are strong, but the situation on the ground says otherwise."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Inflation spike raises fears of monetary tightening in the Philippines.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Philippines inflation jumped 7.2 percent in September, sparking concerns the authorities may have to raise interest rates just when the country needs all the help it can get to keep the economy growing, official figures showed Tuesday. "The central bank may look at that option after the November (2) US presidential election," said Jonathan Ravelas of Banco De Oro. "But our regulators would certainly wait for another adjustment in US rates before making a decision," he added. The September inflation rate, 0.4 percentage points above August, pushed the annualised figure to 5.2 percent, higher than the government's full-year target of 4.0-5.0 percent. The figures are based on the 2000 price series. Using prices with 1994 as a base, inflation rose 6.9 percent year-on-year in September, its fastest rate in five years as the country, already facing what President Gloria Arroyo has recognised as a fiscal crisis, paid the penalty on high oil prices. Ravelas predicted further sharp increases in the months ahead amid pressure from historically high prices for crude oil imports. "We've only just begun. We are certainly up for further record numbers especially with the Christmas season coming," Ravelas said. Philippine shares were weaker Tuesday, a day after market hit a 55-month high, after the inflation figures raised concerns over higher interest rates. "If inflation breaches the 7.0 percent level (using the 1994 base year), that could trigger the central bank to finally increase rates," said Jose Vistan of AB Capital Securities. The composite index closed down 11.06 points or 0.60 percent at 1,840.54. At its last meeting on September 23, the central bank's monetary board kept key interest rates unchanged at their lowest levels in 12 years, despite a quarter percentage point increase in the US federal funds rate. The overnight rates have been kept steady for over a year now at 6.75 percent for borrowing and 9.00 percent for lending. The central bank already expects inflation to exceed the government's targets for this year and 2005 due to supply-side pressures -- which it said cannot be addressed properly through monetary action -- rather than demand. The International Monetary Fund said in a recent country report that "there was a case for monetary tightening given that world interest rates (are) rising." It said that new tax measures and higher electricity rates proposed by President Arroyo to trim the budget deficit "would exert further upward pressure on inflation." There was better news Tuesday on the trade front as the government reported 13.7 percent export growth to 3.415 billion dollars. It was the second time exports posted double-digit growth this year and was an improvement on the 3.2 percent annual rise in July. Exports of electronics products, which accounted for 65.9 percent of all shipments, rose 15.7 percent to 2.25 billion dollars. Within this category, semiconductors were up 14.8 percent to 1.59 billion dollars. The figures defied earlier forecasts of a continuing sluggish performance of the export sector amid an expected slowdown in global demand for electronics. Vistan of AB Capital said the Philippines may continue to see double-digit growth in exports in the last three months, making it easier for the government to hit its target of 10 percent growth in exports this year. "August's double-digit rise could be the start of a trend after the build-up in inventory. for the last quarter," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ASMARA, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Southern Sudanese rebels warned here Monday that the only alternative to a comprehensive peace deal is "comprehensive war". Yasir Arman, spokesman for the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) made this declaration just three days ahead of the last round of peace talks in Kenya between the Sudanese government and the SPLA, during an interview with an AFP journalist. "The alternative to a comprehensive peace settlement is comprehensive war," if peace talks between the SPLA and Khartoum fail, he warned in Asmara. "We prefer to finalise the peace agreement," he added. "We are hopeful that this time the government (Khartoum) will have the political will to finalise the deal." The SPLA, led by John Garang, and Khartoum are in the final stage of the Naivasha (Kenya) peace process, whose aim is to put an end to a civil war that started in 1983, and which has killed nearly one and a half million people. The peace talks are scheduled to last three days, "but the SPLA is ready to give more time to reach a final deal, and expects the same from the government". The deal "was supposed to have been finished a long time ago but the government was trying to buy time," said the SPLA spokesman. "We have resolved the substantial issues, what remains is technical." "If we reach a deal in Naivasha, it will impact positively on Darfur," in Western Sudan where rebels are currently fighting against the government. But if an agreement is not reached, "it will have very grave consequences on the Sudanese situation, and many people see that Sudan is on the verge of collapsing". Yasir Arman repeated that the SPLA has "political relations with the Darfur rebels but no military relations". Libya is to host an African mini-summit on Sudan's Darfur crisis later this month, with Chad, Egypt and Nigeria also taking part, Egyptian presidential spokesman Maged Abdel Fattah announced Monday. "The mini-summit on Darfur will be held under the auspices of Nigeria in its capacity as president of the African Union (AU)," he told reporters. A peace settlement between the SPLA and Khartoum will also be the "biggest step in the normalisation of relations between Sudan and Eritrea," Arman added. Currently, relations between Sudan and Eritrea are strained: Khartoum accuses Asmara of supporting Sudanese rebels in Darfur, a claim which the Eritrean authorities reject. Arman added that John Garang had a meeting with Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki on Friday. "President Isaias expressed his full support for a peace settlement," between the SPLA and Khartoum, insisted Arman. Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir said Sunday he was ready to sign a peace deal with southern rebels and that he did not want to govern the country alone.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Corruption trial of Malaysian ex-minister delayed.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The corruption trial of a former Malaysian cabinet minister was delayed Tuesday after a court postponed the formal mention of his case to December in order to resolve preliminary issues. Former lands and cooperative development minister Kasitah Gaddam, 56, who is now out on bail, has sought a review of the charges, while prosecutors are asking for charges against another former official to be consolidated with Kasitah's case. The minister's early-morning arrest on February 12 stunned Malaysians and was seen as a major test of Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's vow to crack down on corruption after taking over from veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad almost one year ago. Kasitah has pleaded not guilty but resigned from the cabinet shortly after his arrest. High Court Judge Abdull Hamid Embong on Tuesday fixed December 6 as the date for the mention of the case against Kasitah. The Anti Corruption Agency (ACA) said the former minister was arrested over share transactions by the state-owned Sabah Land Development Board on Borneo island, of which Kasitah was formerly chairman, involving up to 40 million ringgit (10.5 million dollars). Kasitah, temporarily free on bail of one million ringgit, was accused of using his position to influence the sale of 16.8 million shares held by the board in Sapi Plantation to a private company, Briskmark Enterprise Sdn Bhd, after being promised 3.36 million shares for himself. Lawyers for Kasitah have applied to the Attorney-General for a review of the charges against him and are still waiting for a reply, they told the court Tuesday before the judge postponed the mention of the case to December. Government prosecutors have in turn appealed for a transfer of the case involving Wasli Mohamad Said, former general manager of Sabah Land Development Board, from Sabah to Kuala Lumpur. Wasli has appeared in court in the Sabah capital Kota Kinabalu on five charges of corruption linked to the same share transactions. "We want the cases to be tried together, as they involve the same witnesses and evidence, it would be more cost-saving, and less time-consuming," deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Hanafiah Zakaria told AFP. Prime Minister Abdullah, who took over from Mahathir on October 31 last year when he retired after 22 years in power, has declared the fight against corruption to be a priority for his administration. The move against Kasitah is one of two high-profile arrests this year over alleged corruption during the period when Mahathir was in power. The former head of troubled steel giant Perwaja, Eric Chia, was charged earlier this year with embezzling 76.4 million ringgit, eight years after an investigation was launched into Malaysia's biggest financial scandal. The trial is ongoing. Kasitah is the highest-ranking Malaysian official brought to court for corruption since former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was arrested in 1998.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GHAZNI, Afghanistan, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Interim President Hamid Karzai risked a rare trip outside Kabul Tuesday as he and his main rival stepped up their campaigns just days ahead of landmark elections. Karzai, whose first attempt to campaign beyond the capital was aborted after a rocket attack on his helicopter last month, was headed for Ghazni, about 100 kilometres (63 miles) south of Kabul. Around 2,000 people had gathered early in the morning at the Samayee public gardens in the city where Karzai was expected to make a speech, with more arriving every minute. Security was heavy, with Karzai's team of American bodyguards beefed up by truckloads of soldiers on the streets, roads blocked and heavy searches of everyone entering the gardens. In Kabul, the man considered to be Karzai's only serious challenger among a total of 18 presidential candidates, former education minister Yunus Qanooni prepared to address a rally at a city football stadium. As he arrived an excited crowd of around 2,000 people chanted "Allahu Akbar" (God is Great) and "Long live Qanooni". His supporters, many of them women, carried posters with Qanooni's picture and banners reading "Vote for Qanooni and establish peace". A female schoolteacher who gave her name only as Bulqis, 45, said: "I prefer Qanooni to Karzai. He has promoted education in the country." A jobless man, Abdul Qadir, 22, who is from the same Tajik etnhnic group as Qanooni said: "Qanooni is a mujahedin (holy warrior). I vote for a mujahedin." US-backed Karzai, who was installed as interim president after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001, is widely tipped to win the election on October 9, but analysts expect Qanooni to make a strong showing.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Donkeys, camels, trucks and aircraft fanned out around Afghanistan's wild landscape Tuesday, carrying ballot boxes and troops ahead of historic presidential elections. Nearly 60,000 Afghan police and soldiers backed by 27,000 international troops were moving into position at 5,000 polling stations in anticipation of attacks by insurgents who have threatened to disrupt Saturday's vote. "The face of security on the day will be Afghan," said John McComber, head of security for the UN-backed electoral commission. "International military will be backup and filling in the holes. The enemy has the advantage of choosing the time and place of attacks and looking for weak points. We aim for there not to be any weak points." Officials have warned of a possible sharp spike in attacks around polling day, with major cities at risk of car-bomb blasts and polling stations under threat of armed assault. "We know what the enemy wants to do but we still don't know what they are capable of doing," McComber said. Hundreds of people have been killed this year in an insurgency by militants of the former hardline Islamic Taliban regime, ousted by a US-led invasion after the September 11 terror attacks on New York and Washington. Twelve electoral workers have been killed and 33 injured. Some 120,000 staff have been hired for the election, and supervisors are training local officials who will man the ballot stations, said Julian Type, an advisor to the UN-backed Afghan electoral commission. Once the vote is completed at dusk on October 9, electoral staff will begin transporting ballot boxes to eight regional counting centers, with initial results expected to be released daily from October 11, Type said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Rebels blamed for a fresh wave of violence in India's restive northeast offered Tuesday to hold talks with New Delhi, as a general strike to protest the bloodletting brought the region to a shuddering halt. "We are ready to hold talks with New Delhi and shall soon convey our decision with respect to the Assam chief minister's truce offer within a few days," the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) said in a statement. The outlawed NDFB, founded in October 1986 to fight for an independent homeland for the Bodo tribe in Assam, claimed responsibility for killing 14 shoppers in western Assam Saturday, when a string of bomb blasts and gunfire left 50 people dead in Assam and neighbouring Nagaland states. Another 19 people, mostly civilians but including three militants blown up by their own bomb, died in further attacks in the two states Sunday and Monday, prompting the Indian government to deploy extra troops in the insurgency-hit region. "We have asked our cadres to prepare themselves for a dialogue to secure our goal of freedom either through peaceful and democratic means or through prolonged fight with India," the rebel statement said. Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi Thursday offered a ceasefire with the NDFB and another rebel army, the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), asking the two outfits to respond to the truce offer by October 15. "We welcome the NDFB's offer for talks. If they are sincere we have no problems, but they should refrain from creating any violence," the chief minister said in his response Tuesday. The ULFA has rejected the ceasefire offer saying it had triggered at least five bomb explosions in Assam over the weekend. "The explosions are an answer to chief minister Tarun Gogoi's offer for a ceasefire," ULFA commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah told local newspapers Monday. Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil Patil Monday said New Delhi was open to talks with rebel groups "although we are committed to taking very strong measures to deal with the spurt in violence". "Let the militant groups come and talk to us, we are prepared to discuss all issues," he said. Meanwhile, police officials in the seven northeastern states -- Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura and Manipur -- said shops, businesses and educational institutions were closed due to the strike, while there was no traffic on the roads. All air services and trains linking the region to the rest of India were either cancelled or rescheduled, officials said. The shutdown was called by the North East Students' Organisation (NESO), the apex body of various students groups in the region. "The strike is in protest at the barbaric incidents of violence in Assam and Nagaland, besides highlighting other burning issues like the illegal infiltration from Bangladesh into the region, and the problem of annual flooding among others," NESO leader Sammujjal Bhattacharyya told AFP. "People in general are responding spontaneously to our strike call as the problems that we are highlighting affects the common masses," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PHNOM PENH, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Cambodia's national assembly on Tuesday amended a series of domestic laws needed for a UN-backed trial of ex-Khmer Rouge leaders to go ahead, inching the kingdom closer to a start for the delayed tribunal. The passage of 29 amendments came a day after lawmakers ratified an agreement between the UN and the government which outlines procedures on trying the surviving leaders. The radical communist regime of 1975-79, headed by tyrant Pol Pot, is blamed for the deaths of up to two million Cambodians from starvation, overwork, execution and disease. "The National Assembly session now ratifies the amendments to the laws. to set up the extraordinary tribunal in Cambodia's courts in order to try crimes committed under the Democratic Kampuchea regime," assembly president Prince Norodom Ranariddh told the session. The laws relate to technical issues such as the structure of the court system, procedures for appointing judges and how foreign judges will work within the Cambodian system. Of 98 attending lawmakers in the 123-seat assembly, 96 voted in favour of the amendments. As with Monday's ratified agreement, the amendments must still be approved by the Senate, the Constitutional Council and King Norodom Sihanouk, formalities which are likely to take a few weeks.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ADELAIDE, Australia, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A training school for counter-terrorist spies from Australia, South-East Asia and the Pacific will be set up if the coalition is re-elected on Saturday, Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday. The 20 million dollar (14.5 million US) centre for counter-terrorism, cooperation and intelligence training -- or spy-school as it has been dubbed -- is the latest in a range of national security measures unveiled as part of Australia's war on terror. A national coordinator for counter-terrorism intelligence cooperation will be appointed to lead a 10-person unit overseeing flying squads of agents sent to the region to work on building the counter-terrorism effort. Howard announced an additional 36.6 million dollars in funding for the government's major intelligence service, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Additional funding would also go to increase Arabic and South-East Asian languages in ASIO and its capacity to undertake background security checks on prospective immigrants, he said. "This country is more secure than most," Howard told 900 workers at the Australian Submarine Corporation plant in the Labor-held seat of Port Adelaide. But he said the Bali bombings which claimed 88 Australian lives in October 2002 and the recent bomb blast outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta demosntrated the need for closer links between intelligence, defence and security. "In the fight against terrorism. nothing is more important than the adequate resourcing of our intelligence agencies," Howard said. "It's important that we have coordination and integration between our foreign policy, our defence policy and our security effort. "The ultimate responsibility of any prime minister of this country at any time is to take the decisions that are necessary to protect and defend the safety of the Australian nation and all of the Australian nation." He was accompanied during his visit to the plant by Defence Minister Robert Hill, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Attorney-General Philip Ruddock.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BEIJING, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[China's city dwellers have been busy spending money during the ongoing "Golden Week" October 1 National Day holiday, state media reported Tuesday, looking back at the first four days of the vacation. In Beijing alone, residents have spent a total of 460 million yuan (55 million dollars) on shopping and tourism, the Xinhua news agency reported. When measured by consumption of Beijing duck -- a roasted delicacy -- holiday-related spending seems to be reaching new highs. One outlet of the Quanjude Beijing duck chain reported a total of 5,287 sold on Saturday, setting a daily record for the company, according to Xinhua. The week-long holidays, of which the Chinese now have a total of three each year, were launched in the late 1990s at a time of sluggish economic growth brought about partly by the Asian financial crisis. With a roaring economy growing at close to 10 percent, China's policymakers are not under the same pressure to boost private consumer spending, but the "Golden Weeks" nevertheless seem here to stay. Ninety-nine major tourist spots across the nation have seen a total of 8.6 million visitors in the first four days of the holiday, the People's Daily reported, without citing a comparable figure for last year. The paper also cited an incomplete survey of the hospitality industry, saying 27 major tourist hotels throughout China had occupancy rates exceeding 80 percent, and 13 had occupancy rates of more than 90 percent. A new trend among holidaymakers in China is to organize trips themselves rather than relying on packages, according to the People's Daily. It cited data from the vast city of Chongqing in the southwest of the country, where up to 70 percent of all tourists have put their holiday together themselves.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush and his Democratic rival, John Kerry, are tied in their race for the White House, but Kerry appears to have failed to shake the perception that he panders to voters, a new New York Times/CBS News poll showed Tuesday. The newspaper said the survey had also found significant doubts about Bush's policies toward Iraq, with a majority of the public saying that the United States invaded too soon and that the administration did a poor job thinking through the consequences of the war. Both Bush and Kerry had the support of 47 percent of registered voters surveyed in the poll. Forty-one percent of respondents said they had confidence in Kerry's ability to deal wisely with an international crisis, up from 32 percent before last week's nationally televised debate, according to The Times. Thirty-nine percent said they had a lot of confidence the Massachusetts senator would make the right decisions when it came to protecting against a terrorist attack, up 13 percentage points. However Kerry still trailed Bush on these issues. Fifty-one percent of voters said they had confidence in Bush's ability to deal with an international crisis, unchanged from before the debate, and 52 percent said they had a lot of confidence in his ability to protect against a terrorist attack, up slightly from 50 percent last month, the paper said. Meanwhile, Bush's strategy of portraying Kerry as an unprincipled flip-flopper appears to have stuck in the national consciousness, The Times pointed out. Sixty percent of those surveyed said Kerry told people what they wanted to hear rather than what he really believed, about the same level as throughout the spring and summer. The corresponding figure for Bush was 38 percent, according to the report.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JERUSALEM, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The UN Security Council was set to vote Tuesday on a draft resolution calling for Israel to pull its troops out of Gaza after a huge onslaught that has left almost 80 Palestinians dead in less than a week. The resolution, sponsored by Algeria and debated at the UN on Monday, was criticised by Israel's top ally the United States, which labelled it "one more step on the road to nowhere." But US Secretary of State Colin Powell said he hoped that Israel's offensive in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the deadliest operations against Palestinians since the start of the intifada four years ago, would end soon. Powell repeated the US position that Israel had a right to defend itself, but called on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to use a proportionate response to Palestinian rocket attacks. "Mr Sharon finds the need to respond to that," Powell said before arriving in Brazil. "I hope that it does not expand, I hope that whatever he does is proportionate to the threat that Israel is facing and I hope that this operation can come to a conclusion quickly." Israel's chief of staff said on Monday that the operation, which is aimed at preventing Palestinian militants from firing improvised rockets at Israel, could last for weeks. Another armed Palestinian man was killed overnight by an Israeli tank shell fired at the densely populated Jabaliya refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinian hospital sources said early Tuesday. The identity of the victim was not given. Since Israel began the operation seven days ago, at least 78 Palestinians have been killed in what has been the deadliest incursion into Gaza since the start of the intifada, or uprising, in September 2000. On Monday eight Palestinians, including a child and a teenage girl, were killed by Israeli fire. The Gaza incursion has sparked deep international concern, including a weekend call from UN chief Kofi Annan for Israel to halt the operation. On Monday, Egypt called the incursion a "dangerous escalation." The proposed UN resolution "demands the immediate cessation of all military operations in the area of Northern Gaza and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces from that area." US ambassador John Danforth dismissed the text as "one more step on the road to nowhere." "The Security Council and the General Assembly, instead of saying 'stop' to both sides, act as the cheerleaders of the Palestinians," Danforth said. Dutch ambassador Dirk van den Berg, who spoke for the European Union, said Israel's response to Palestinian attacks was "disproportionate." "Though Israel has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, the exercise of this right should take place within the boundaries of international law," he said. Algerian ambassador Abdallah Baali denounced "the disgraceful methods used by Israel today against defenseless civilian populations." The textying pattern of UN involvement in terrorist activities."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Singapore's former prime minister Goh Chok Tong will spearhead his government's efforts to resolve outstanding issues with Malaysia, the two governments announced Tuesday in a further sign of rapidly improving bilateral relations. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, visiting Malaysia as part of a swing through Southeast Asian neighbours after taking over in August, and his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi agreed on the new role for Goh, who is known for a genial, consensus-driven style. Lee and Abdullah made the announcement after meeting in Malaysia's administrative centre Putrajaya outside Kuala Lumpur and agreed to take further steps to promote cooperation, including joint business activities in emerging markets like China, Indonesia and India. Goh, 63, stepped down as prime minister in August after 14 years in power in favour of his deputy Lee, son of Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, who led the city-state out of the Malaysian federation in 1965 amid a dispute over racial policies. Ties have often been stormy since the separation but improved quickly after Abdullah took over from Malaysia's feisty veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad in October last year. Aides told AFP that Goh and Abdullah are known to have warm personal relations. Goh took the title Senior Minister -- number two in Singapore's political hierarchy -- after stepping down, and concurrently serves as chairman of the central bank. "We have already invited Senior Miniser Goh to visit Malaysia. I believe he will be able to make at least one visit by end of the year," Abdullah told journalists after meeting with Lee. The Singapore leader said that he told Abdullah that "although I have taken over as prime minister, I have asked Mr. Goh Chok Tong to look after the bilateral issues because he is familiar with them," adding that the issues were 'complex" with "many ins and outs." "Mr. Goh understands them. We need to have continuity with our policies. Mr. Abdullah has happily agreed that Mr. Goh will be our interlocutor and will deal with Malaysia on the issues," Lee said. Singapore and Malaysia, both former British colonies, have a history of prickly relations dating back to their 1965 separation, after a two-year union. Disputes persists over the price of long-term raw water supplies to Singapore, Singapore's military access to Malaysian airspace, the future of Malaysian-owned railway land inside Singapore, and a proposed new bridge linking the two nations.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TAIPEI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Taiwan share prices closed little changed trade Tuesday as investors took to the sidelines in the absence of convincing fresh leads after the very sharp gains made Monday, dealers said. They said the market were hesitant to push the upside much further after the benchmark index breached the 6,000 points level Monday on the back of foreign investor purchases. The weighted index closed up 3.05 points or 0.05 percent at 6,081.01, off a low of 6,063.01 and a high of 6,111.23, on turnover of 96.65 billion Taiwan dollars (2.85 billion US). Risers led decliners 380 to 249, with 183 stocks unchanged. A total of 22 stocks closed limit-up and seven limit-down. The construction sector was up 1.12 percent, textiles rose 1.11 percent and electronics 0.06 percent while plastics/petrochemicals fell 0.68 percent, paper was down 0.58 percent and cement off 0.49 percent. "Investors found no reason -- not even the modest gains on Wall Street overnight -- to extend yesterday's rally," SinoPac Securities analyst Teng Ke-hsin said. "A pause is not that surprising after the market succeeded in recovering 6,000 points. The market has to see if that support level will hold." Now that financials and old-economy industrials have found their way into most institutional portfolios, the key electronics sector will determine if the market can continue higher, Teng said. For the moment, there are some doubts whether electronics will see their traditionally strong second half, leaving the outlook uncertain, he added. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed down 0.20 Taiwan dollars at 45.30 and United Microelectronics Corp was flat at 21.40. MediaTek was down 6.00 at 233.00 and NovaTek down 2.00 at 89.00 after news that UMC plans to sell 5.0 million shares of each company. Powerchip was up 0.10 at 28.00 after reporting September results. Flat-panel shares closed off highs as profit-taking set in, with AU Optronics up 0.40 at 43.90 and Chi Mei up 0.10 at 42.80. Mega Financial was up 0.10 at 22.30, Chang Hwa Bank up 0.10 at 20.70 and Taiwan Fertilizer 0.50 higher at 32.60, with the three companies little affected by reports the Cabinet's Development Fund planned sell shares in the companies. Formosa Chemicals was down 1.50 at 61.00, turning weaker on a plan by a Formosa Plastics group affiliate to sell its shares in the company.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Pet owners in the Philippines have been ordered to register any exotic wildlife they own or face arrest, the government said Tuesday. The owners have been given 60 days to obtain "certificates of wildlife registration" for "threatened, non-threatened, and exotic wildlife" under their care. The order also covers wild plants. "We are calling on all individuals and groups who are in possession of any wild fauna or animals, whether these are declared endangered or not, or are exotic or imported, to register their pets with the nearest (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) office starting October 11," Environment Secretary Michael Defensor said. After December 9, wildlife officers could confiscate undocumented wildlife species and arrest their owners even without a court order, he said in a statement. The registration program is part of efforts to conserve wildlife under a law that came into effect in 2001. Violators face maximum jail terms of 12 years and fines of up to a million pesos (17,762 dollars). The department said it has rescued 3,664 wild birds and animals of various species since January 2003.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BALTIMORE, Maryland, Oct 4 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Priest Holmes scored two touchdowns as Kansas City won its first game of the season with a 27-24 victory over Baltimore on Monday. Holmes rushed for a career-high 33 times for 125 yards as the Chiefs captured their first game since December 2003. Holmes, an all-pro tailback, allowed the Chiefs to control the ball for 38:23 of the game - gaining 25 first downs to just 13 for the Ravens. The Chiefs also handed Baltimore its first loss at home since losing to Kansas City in week four last season. Baltimore levelled the score at 10-10 on a 57-yard flea-flicker from Kyle Boller to Randy Hymes in the second quarter. Holmes ran seven times for 35 yards, including a four-yard TD run, in Kansas City's 13-play, 80-yard drive that ate up 8:08. It was the longest drive allowed by Baltimore in eight years - its first year after the move from Cleveland. B.J Sams evened the score with a 57-yard punt return with less than two minutes to go before the half. Kansas City took a 20-17 lead on a 38-yard field goal by Lawrence Tynes halfway through the third quarter and limited Baltimore to just five plays on the ensuing drive before putting together the decisive 14-play, 79-yard drive. Holmes capped the march with a one-yard scoring drive on the first play of the fourth quarter. Holmes has now rushed for at least 100 yards in a game 29 times. Trent Green completed 21-of-31 passes for 223 yards, including a three-yard touchdown toss to Jason Dunn in the opening quarter. Baltimore's Jamal Lewis rush for a one-yard touchdown early in the final quarter to reduce the Chiefs lead to three points. On third-and-goal from the Kansas City eight-yard line, Chiefs cornerback Dexter McCleon was called for pass interference on what appeared to be an uncatchable pass from Kyle Boller. Boller was intercepted by cornerback Eric Warfield on the next play, but a defensive holding call against Warfield eliminated the turnover and allowed Lewis to score the final TD. Lewis ran the ball 15 times for 73 yards. Kansas City held him to under 100 yards for the third time this season after he was held under the century mark just four times in 2003.]]></c>

"We never had enough troops on the ground," Ambassador Paul Bremer told a conference of insurance professionals in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, Monday. He said the lack of adequate patrolling following the fall of Baghdad and other parts of the country to US troops had resulted in what he called "horrid" looting.

		<c><![CDATA[A report to be made public on Wednesday by the top US weapons inspector in Iraq will outline attempts by Saddam Hussein's government to undermine UN sanctions as part of a plan to produce illicit weapons if those sanctions were lifted, The New York Times reported Tuesday. Citing unnamed Bush administration officials, the newspaper said the report by inspector Charles Duelfer will make clear that Iraq did not possess stockpiles of illicit weapons at the time of the American invasion in 2003, and that it had not begun any large-scale program for weapons production by the time of the invasion. Those findings had previously been reported, based on an early draft of the document, The Times said. But the final version of the document describes new evidence of concerted Iraqi efforts to bypass the sanctions while they were still in place and to undermine international support for them, according to the report. The evidence is expected to figure prominently in efforts by the administration to cast the report in a favorable light, the paper said. With presidential election day less than a month away, the White House has been seeking to persuade voters that the war in Iraq was justified even though the alleged weapons stockpiles used to justify the invasion have never been found.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Mahathir sees social equity as basis for world economic development =.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Former Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday said that promoting social equity is a crucial for world economic growth, citing Malaysia's success as an example. Speaking before the annual Philippine Business Conference here, Mahathir said Malaysia's success in closing the gap between wealthy ethnic Chinese and poorer Malays had spurred economic growth while minimizing class and racial tensions. "On a world scale, we are witnessing today how the greed of the rich is affecting the growth of the world and themselves because of disregard for equity in the distribution of opportunities and wealth between rich nations and poor nations," Mahathir said. "That, in essence, is what the present interpretation of globalization is about." He said that "achieving growth is relatively simple when the question of equity is ignored" but warned that this would soon result in class and even racial tensions as the gap between the rich and poor widened. Mahathir, who retired in October after 22 years in power, cited the experience of Malaysia where race riots broke out in 1969 between the poorer, majority-Malays and the minority ethnic Chinese. To alleviate this, a coalition government of all ethnic groups was set up and a policy of "affirmative action" was implemented to pull more of the Malays up to the level of the Chinese. While there is still a difference between the economic status of the ethnic Chinese and the Malays, "the disparity is less than before and therefore, more tolerable." Thus, during the 1997 Asian currency crisis, "the Malaysians did not blame the Chinese for the recession and did not burn Chinese shops," said Mahathir. He also cited other measures to promote equity such as taxation of the rich, subsidies to the poor, control of prices of essential goods and promoting labor-intensive industries to create jobs. At the same time, he warned that wages must stay competitive or workers would start to lose jobs as investment dries up. Mahathir declined to say which countries could prosper from following Malaysia's example stating instead that if any country wanted to learn lessons from Malaysia, "they are welcome to do so."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GHAZNI, Afghanistan, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Interim President Hamid Karzai risked a rare trip outside Kabul Tuesday as he and his main rival stepped up their campaigns just days ahead of Afghanistan's landmark elections. Karzai, whose first attempt to campaign beyond the capital was aborted after a rocket attack on his helicopter last month, was headed for Ghazni, about 100 kilomtres (63 miles) south of Kabul. Around 2,000 people had gathered early in the morning at the Samayee public gardens in the city where Karzai was expected to make a speech, with more people arriving every minute. Security was heavy, with Karzai's team of American bodyguards beefed up by truckloads of soldiers on the streets, roads blocked and heavy searches of everyone entering the gardens. In Kabul, the man considered to be Karzai's only serious challenger among a total of 18 presidential candidates, former education minister Yunus Qanooni addressed a rally at a city football stadium -- used as an execution ground by the former hardline Islamic Taliban regime. As Qanooni arrived an excited crowd of around 2,000 people chanted "Allahu Akbar" (God is Great) and "Long live Qanooni". His supporters, many of them women, carried posters with Qanooni's picture and banners reading "Vote for Qanooni and establish peace". A female schoolteacher who gave her name only as Bulqis, 45, said: "I prefer Qanooni to Karzai. He has promoted education in the country." A jobless man, Abdul Qadir, 22, who is from the same Tajik etnhnic group as Qanooni said: "Qanooni is a mujahiden (holy warrior). I vote for a mujahiden." The US-backed candidate, Karzai, 46, who was elected by a council of tribal leaders in June 2002 after the former Taliban regime was ousted in a 2001 US-led invasion, is widely tipped to win. Seventeen other candidates are standing for election, but Qanooni, 47, a prominent anti-Taliban fighter, is seen as Karzai's only serious challenger. Among the other candidates are two former communists from the days of Soviet control in the 1980s; a couple of warlords; five with links to anti-Soviet Islamic fighters; one woman, and a French-speaking poet. At stake is not only the presidency of this turbulent land, but the status of the US-led war on terrorism, which has sharply divided the world over the past three years. The war-weary men and women who leave their farms and villages for the 5,000 voting stations scattered through Afghanistan's wild landscape on October 9 will be playing a part in the bitter battle for the US presidency. A smooth election with an undisputed outcome -- neither of which is guaranteed -- will enable President George W. Bush to claim a victory for his much-maligned foreign policy and predict a similar outcome for Iraq. Some 18,500 US-led troops remain in Afghanistan after failing to capture or kill terror mastermind Osama bin Laden, whose presence in Afghanistan was the reason for the invasion after the September 11 attacks on the US. They are supported by around 9,000 NATO troops responsible for security in the capital Kabul and in the northern provinces. Little attention has been paid to the sort of issues that dominate most elections, with polls by rights groups showing that the overwhelming majority of Afghans simply want peace after 25 years of conflict. But ethnicity, in the absence of any significant political parties, is expected to play a large part in the way the more than 10 million registered voters cast their ballots.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[HOBART, Australia, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Four days before the Australian election, the opposition Labor party was Tuesday facing a damaging split over its environmental policies as new polling put the government in a winning position. Politicians on both sides said Labor is facing a bitter backlash in the island state of Tasmania over opposition leader Mark Latham's plan to protect its world-renowned natural forests. Labor MP Dick Adams, who represents a Tasmanian seat in federal parliament, warned that Latham's promise to end logging could cost him three vital seats in what is expected to be a tight contest. Latham, whose party needs second-preference votes from supporters of the increasingly popular Australian Greens to have any chance of winning on Saturday, has been accused of trying to lock in the support of the Greens at the expense of Tasmania's timber jobs. In a move condemned by timber workers and many politicians, but welcomed by the Greens, Latham promised to end logging in some of the natural forests and spend 800 million dollars (576 million US) to protect forestry jobs. Prime Minister John Howard, who is expected to announce the government's policy on Tasmanian forests on Wednesday or Thursday, condemned Labor's plan as a sell-out. "Mr Latham has sold out the workers of Tasmania to win Green preferences," he told reporters. "This is not a forestry policy, it's a grubby preference deal." The row flared as the latest opinion poll, the second in two days, gave Howard's conservative government an election-winning lead. The Australian's Newspoll, which for almost 20 years has had the best record in tipping election outcomes, put Howard's Liberal-National coalition ahead -- by 50.5 to 49.5 percent -- for the first time in the election campaign. The Sydney Morning Herald's respected ACNielsen survey, which has had the government ahead for a fortnight, gave it a lead of 52-48 percent in its poll on Monday, enough to return the conservatives to office for a fourth term with a similar eight-seat majority. Both polls also show Labor would depend on the second-preference votes of the minor parties, particularly the Greens, to win office. Under Australia's complex preferential system, voters' second choices or "preferences" can be the deciding factor in handing victory to one of the major parties. The Newspoll showed that on primary votes the ruling Liberal-National coalition was leading by 46 percent to 39 percent. But with the minor party second preferences going heavily to Labor, the government leads by only one percentage point at 50.5-49.5. Adams said Labor's forestry strategy could backfire, with three of its five Tasmanian seats at risk. "I think that's a terrible thing to have done, all because we want to win seats in Melbourne and Sydney," he added. "I think that there's been decisions made, that there's better chances of winning seats on the mainland and there's been a total sell-out of the Tasmanian Labor position." Latham defended his policy Tuesday, saying it was about the environment and future generations of workers, not about politics. "This is the right thing to do and our plan will protect jobs and ensure that there are no net job losses in the forest industry in Tasmania," he told a Melbourne radio station. "I don't want to die wondering about future generations of Australians and their access to the mighty Tasmanian forests."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Australian share prices closed up 0.11 percent at yet another record high Tuesday as gains in the banking and resource sectors offset losses in market heavyweight News Corp., dealers said. They said the tone remains optimistic, with investors remaining confident despite the uncertainties thrown up by the approaching October 9 elections here and concerns over the US economic outlook. The benchmark SP/ASX 200 index rose 4.0 points at 3,697.6 while the broader All Ordinaries index also reached a fresh high, up 1.9 points at 3,705.0. Volume was 910.0 million shares worth 2.39 billion dollars (1.72 billion US), with 716 stocks up, 657 down and 346 steady. Macquarie Financial Services private client advisor Amanda Cook said investors remained optimistic despite uncertainty over the outcome of Australia's October 9 election, doubts about the pace of US economic growth and the expectation domestic interest rates will rise before the end of the year. "It has been an extraordinary few weeks -- I never anticipated such a strong market," Cook said. She said resources rose after BHP Billiton announced a 1.0-1.5 billion dollar share buy-back while banks gained on expectations of strong results when they report their full-year figures early next month. Ord Minnett dealer Quentin Timms said News Corp. fell on uncertainty about whether the media giant's plan to move its stock exchange listing and headquarters to the United States would be accepted at a meeting later this month. "News Corp. was a dead weight on the index and some profit taking elsewhere limited overall gains," he said. News Corp. dropped 24 cents or more than two percent to 11.34 dollars. In resources, BHP Billiton was up nine cents at a record 14.84 dollars and WMC Resources moved up two cents to 5.49 dollars, while Rio Tinto fell five cents to 38.85 dollars. Among the banks, National Australia Bank rose three cents to 27.15 dollars, Westpac added 10 cents to 17.82 dollars and ANZ was up three cents to 19.25 dollars while Commonwealth Bank fell nine cents to 30.71 dollars. Telecoms giant Telstra fell two cents to 4.63 dollars and Optus-owner SingTel slipped one cent to 1.96 dollars. Flag carrier Qantas Airways was up two cents to 3.45 dollars and discount airline Virgin Blue was steady at 1.75 dollars.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The latest in a series of hoax calls to Greece's national carrier resulted in an Athens-to-London flight being rerouted, but the aircraft was able to leave on Tuesday after an unscheduled stop-over on the island of Corfu, airline officials said. The Olympic Airlines flight was diverted to Corfu, in the west of Greece, shortly after the call was received on Monday evening, the company said. The Airbus craft, which was carrying 205 passengers and seven crew members, was checked overnight by specialist security forces and given the green light to take off at 6:00 am (0300 GMT) on Tuesday, Olympic said. The alert came in an anonymous phone call to an Athens newspaper, claiming that there was a bomb aboard the craft. It was then accompanied to Corfu by two Greek air force fighter planes. Olympic Airlines had already been hit by two similar hoax alerts in late September, both concerning flights headed for the United States.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW DELHI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korea on Tuesday played down the latest setback to talks on the North Korean nuclear standoff, saying Seoul was used to dealing with "unexpected" hurdles in its dealings with the Stalinist state. "The North Korean nuclear issue as well as inter-Korean relations. are often confronted by unexpected contingencies," South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun told reporters in New Delhi before talks with Indian leaders. "It is only natural that such circumstances occur," he said on the second day of his three-day visit to India. "However because we are all working to bring a peaceful resolution, before long, we will come to a smooth settlement," said Roh. "The Korean government is firmly committed to achieving peace and prosperity on the basis of trust," he said. Pyongyang refused to take part in a fourth round of multilateral talks on its nuclear weapons program which had been scheduled for September, blaming both US "hostile" policy and secret nuclear experiments in South Korea. Relations between the two Koreas have been strained over Seoul's shock revelations last month its scientists had carried out clandestine nuclear experiments. The scientists, it said, had extracted a small amount of plutonium -- a key ingredient for making nuclear bombs -- in secret research in the early 1980s and had also conducted unauthorised experiments to enrich uranium, also used to build nuclear weapons. Seoul said the experiments were not linked to an atomic weapons programme but the clandestine activity has embarrassed the United States when it and ally South Korea were trying, through six-party talks, to pressure Stalinist North Korea to end its nuclear weapons drive. North Korea Saturday ruled out any progress in inter-Korean relations unless the South's secret nuclear experiments are thoroughly investigated. The nuclear stand-off intensified in October 2002 when the United States accused North Korea of operating a nuclear weapons programme based on enriched uranium in violation of a 1994 agreement. Pyongyang has denied running the uranium-based programme but has restarted its plutonium program.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korean share prices closed 0.45 percent higher Tuesday, extending gains for a fifth straight session on continued foreign investor interest, dealers said. After choppy early trade following Monday's stellar gains of more than four percent, the market moved into positive territory by late afternoon and closed modestly higher with the help of foreign investor support. The KOSPI index closed up 4.00 points at 884.84. Volume was 363 million shares worth 2.3 trillion won (2.0 billion dollars). Gains led loser 363 to 347, with 92 stocks unchanged. Foreign investors were net buyers of stocks worth 165 billion won while retail investors were net sellers of shares worth 237 billion won. "The market was supposed to take a pause today following yesterday's rally but it firmed up again as foreign investors kept buying stock," Seoul Securities strategist Park Moon-Seo said. "It shows that the market is quite strong. Chances are now high that the key index will breach the psychologically-important 900 points barrier pretty soon although it's uncertain which direction it will take from there," Park said. He said the market's strength reflects steady interest from foreign investors, strong futures and generally reduced selling pressure. Samsung Electronics closed down 2,000 won at 488,000 on profit-taking after volatile trade. Hynix Semiconductor was up 250 won at 11,850 on a positive fourth quarter earnings outlook. Techs were mixed otherwise on selective profit-taking. LG Electronics ended down 700 won at 67,300, while Samsung SDI, a leading display panel maker, closed up 1,000 won at 123,500. LG Philips LCD rose 400 won at 37,500. Hyundai Motor added 1,500 won at 60,600, its highest closing level ever, as foreign investors continued to buy the country's largest automaker on expectations of strong demand in the fourth quarter following the recent release of new Sonata models. Banks also closed mostly higher. Kookmin Bank added 700 won at 40,000 after strong support from foreign investors on a positive earnings outlook for next year. LG Card was limit-up 2,250 won at 17,400 after a report that the nation's largest card issuer turned profitable in September for the first time in two years. SK Networks rose 1,200 won at 13,000 on hopes the trading firm's management will put the company back on the right track earlier than previously expected due to an improving business climate, dealers said. Major domestic plays corrected recent gains. Shinsegae, the nation's largest discount store chain, closed down 1,000 won at 320,000, while Nongshim, the largest instant noodle maker, closed down 4,000 won at 249,000.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[South Korea credit card companies on road to recovery: analysts by Par Chan-Kyong (- UPDATES source, abalyst quotes, details).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korean credit card issuers, whose enormous losses have been a drag on the country's economy for two years, are turning around earlier than expected, analysts and reports said Tuesday. LG Card, the largest credit card issuer in this country, moved back into the black in September for the first time in two years with a 10 billion won (8.7 million dollars) net profit, Internet news service MoneyToday said. The news sent LG Card shares up by their daily limit of 14.85 percent to 17,400 won. If confirmed, the figures would show that LG Card had reduced its monthly loss, which had been hovering around 100 billion won, to 20 billion won each in July and August. As a result, the company has cut a widely expected loss of 255 billion won for the three months to September to just 30 billion won, MoneyToday said, quoting industry sources. "LG Card's bottom line is improving much faster than expected," Sung Byung-Soo of Kyobo Securities told AFP. "My earlier forecast for LG Card for the fourth quarter was a 90 billion won loss but it is now expected to post some 50 billion won in net profit," he said. For 2005, LG Card is likely to report a 270 billion won net profit, he said. LG Card declined to release any third quarter data pending a general shareholders' meeting due at the end of October. Korea Development Bank and other creditors in January rescued LG Card from bankruptcy by granting it a two trillion won debt rollover and agreeing to convert their 3.5 trillion won in loans into equity in LG Card. Merrill Lynch Securities in August signed a deal with LG Card to invest 400 million dollars by purchasing its asset-backed securities. "Clients, who had left us en masse as late as last March, have since then been returning swiftly," an LG Card official was quoted as saying by MoneyToday. The company has put aside huge loan loss provisions and underwent strict corporate restructuring, with LG employees vowing to not get into any labor disputes for this year at least. The company is expected to remain profitable throughout the fourth quarter to December, the LG Card official said. Samsung Card Co., another major credit card issuer, also successfully reduced its losses from an average 100 billion won over the first six months to 20 billion won in July and 16 billion won in August. Several other credit card issuers are also expected to post between 40 and 70 billion won of losses for the third quarter, rasing hopes that they will be able to turn around in the fourth quarter, MoneyToday said.]]></c>

After saying a couple of months ago he didn't want to leave California following his August 6 trade from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Celtics, Payton showed up. The aging point guard missed an August 13 deadline for his physical test after the deal. On August 28, he was arrested in California for suspected drink driving. The Lakers dealt Payton, forward Rick Fox and a first-round pick to the Celtics for centre Chris Mihm, guards Marcus Banks and Chucky Atkins and a second-round pick. Fox has decided to retire. When Payton expressed displeasure the trade was changed and Boston took back Banks and sent forward Jumaine Jones to the Lakers. Payton, who makes 5.4 million dollars a season, struggled in Los Angeles, averaging 14.6 points - his lowest since the 1992-93 season. Nicknamed "The Glove" for his strong defence, Payton was elected to the NBA all-defensive first team eight consecutive seasons from 1994-2001 and ranks fifth all-time in steals with 2,243.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Singapore's former prime minister Goh Chok Tong will head his government's efforts to resolve disputes with neighbouring Malaysia, the two governments announced Tuesday in a further sign of rapidly improving relations after decades of bickering. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, visiting Malaysia as part of a swing through Southeast Asian neighbours after taking over in August, and his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi agreed on the new role for Goh, who is known for a genial, consensus-driven style. Lee and Abdullah made the announcement after meeting in Malaysia's administrative centre Putrajaya. They agreed to take further steps to promote cooperation, including joint business activities in emerging markets like China, Indonesia and India. The two leaders also witnessed the signing of a new agreement on the avoidance of double taxation to promote trade, investment, financial activities and the movement of technical experts across their borders. "We regard this as an important event in our bilateral relations," Abdullah, 64, told journalists in a joint appearance with Lee after their meeting. Lee, 52, said "the tone of relations has improved in the last 12-18 months," adding that "we need to build on this and develop more momentum of cooperation between our two countries." "We can cooperate in tourism. Our private sector can work together. We can cooperate in security matters, anti-terrorism and security in the Malacca Strait," he said. Lee also cited joint efforts to combat the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic last year and the current bird flu problem in Southeast Asia. Goh, 63, stepped down as prime minister in August after 14 years in power in favour of his deputy Lee, son of Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, 81. The elder Lee led the city-state out of the Malaysian federation in 1965 amid a dispute over racial policies. Ties have often been stormy since the separation but improved quickly after Abdullah took over from Malaysia's feisty veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad, 78, in October last year. Aides told AFP that Goh and Abdullah have warm personal relations. Goh took the title Senior Minister -- number two in Singapore's political hierarchy -- after stepping down and is also chairman of the central bank. "We have already invited Senior Minister Goh to visit Malaysia. I believe he will be able to make at least one visit by end of the year," Abdullah told journalists. Lee said he told Abdullah that "although I have taken over as prime minister, I have asked Mr. Goh Chok Tong to look after the bilateral issues because he is familiar with them," adding that the issues were 'complex" with "many ins and outs." Disputes persists over the price of long-term water supplies to Singapore, Singapore's military access to Malaysian airspace, the future of Malaysian-owned railway land inside Singapore, and a proposed new bridge linking the two nations.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Kerry tries to 'feel the pain' by Stephen Collinson.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[CORALVILLE, Iowa, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[A crowd watches, many eyes wet with tears, as John Kerry drapes his towering frame around a seven-year-old boy battling Type-1 diabetes. Similar snapshots of the Democratic presidential nominee, in this case offering a hug in a town-hall meeting devoted to stem cell research Monday in New Hampshire, have popped up often in recent "town hall" events. Kerry has been working to "feel the pain" of steelworkers, African American churchgoers and the sick, retooling an image once seen as aloof, ahead of a cliffhanger November 2 election. The veteran Senator's bedside manner, which observers say has improved over months on the stump, will be put to the test in his second head-to-head debate with President George W. Bush Friday night in St. Louis, Missouri. Kerry, who flew into battleground state Iowa late Monday night, rescued his campaign with a statesmanlike showing, in the first debate in a formal setting last week. But the second "town-hall" style contest forces candidates to field questions from voters, and conventional wisdom has it that Bush has more of a common touch. Forging an emotional connection with the public is more important for an American President than for a European prime minister, for instance. He is not just a political leader and commander in chief but head of state, and sets the spiritual tone during moments of national crisis, as Bush did after the September 11 attacks. But the back-slapping, hugging, flick a switch empathy essential for akers. Part of Kerry's perceived problem might lay in the fact that he is of a generation, and from New England stock, far removed from today's touchy feely culture. Unlike Bush, a born again Christian, Roman Catholic Kerry does not publicly discuss his faith. Kerry's town-hall meetings are "a good way for people to ask him whatever is on their minds, for voters to get a sense of where he is," said Dobbins. Democrats dispute Bush's reputation as a 'good connector' and argue that the President's own town-hall events are vetted to ensure softball questions. Kerry supporters in New Hampshire said he was more relaxed, roaming around the audience, and telling jokes, than he had been during the Democratic nominating race early in 2004. "He seems very comfortable in a crowd now, he was moving around well, holding the microphone," said Beth Dixon, a registered Democrat from New Hampshire. "It may be something to do with the debate." Kerry's upbringing, Ivy Leagumums, blue collar labourers and out out-of-work steel workers, before invoking John F. Kennedy's mantra "to those to whom much is given, much is expected."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Indonesia's president-elect Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has drawn a cautious blueprint for a new cabinet of "professionals" with which he hopes to implement broad pledges of economic reform, reports said Tuesday. Yudhoyono, who on Monday was announced as the winner of the presidential election, is due to install his new cabinet on October 20, the same day he takes over from defeated incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri. According to the Tempo Interactif online news service, the president-elect was seeking advice on the formation of a cabinet lineup that showed "capacity, integrity and dedication." "If there is experience, it would be even better," he told a meeting of senior editors on Monday, Tempo said. Yudhoyono said that 40 percent of his cabinet membership will be filled by representatives from the political parties which had backed him. The remaining 60 percent would be professionals. Former security minister Yudhoyono, who heads the Democrat Party, was backed by an alliance of minority parties -- including two conservative Islamic parties, the Prosperous Justice Party and the Crescent and Star Party. He said he would meet potential cabinet members personally, a departure from his predecessors who often inducted ministers over the phone. "I will conduct a fit and proper test, between 30 minutes and one hour. I will present my concepts and my wishes and then I will ask whether the person is capable of implementing them," he said. He said the format of the cabinet would not change, to avoid wasting time as he prepares to embark on a programme of economic reform. However, he stressed that sensitive positions, including those of attorney general, minister of defence and intelligence minister would not be given to party representatives.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Cheney, Edwards prepare for debate as race tightens by Peter Mackler (ADDS poll results).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US Vice President Dick Cheney will square off with his Democratic rival John Edwards in a televised debate Tuesday that suddenly takes on importance for the Republicans after George W. Bush's tepid showing last week. Political analysts agree that vice presidential debates, which go back to 1976, usually have little impact on the race for the White House since voters cast their ballots strictly for the man at the top. But the stakes will be higher in Tuesday's encounter in the midwestern city of Cleveland, coming five days after Bush suffered a clear defeat at the hands of Senator John Kerry in the first of their three debates. Republicans said Cheney would seek to repair the damage from the Democrat's relentless attacks on the Iraq war and renew the focus on Bush's leadership after the September 11, 2001 strikes. The 63-year-old political veteran was also likely to highlight his knowledge and experience, and portray Edwards, a freshman senator from North Carolina, as part of a Democratic team unfit to command the war on terror. Kerry campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart, speaking to reporters in a conference call, made it clear that Edwards would call on his skills as a trial lawyer to take the offensive against Cheney and Bush. He said Edwards would hold the White House "accountable for their record from everything to squeezing the middle class while taking care of the powerful and the well connected to the failed energy plan and to the mess that we are in in Iraq." The 51-year-old Democrat was ready to skewer Cheney as the architect of the administration's security policies that produced chaos in Iraq but led to windfall reconstruction contracts for his former company, Halliburton, Lockhart said. Vice presidential debates have traditionally been written off as side shows to the campaign. retired vice admiral James Stockdale, the running mate of independent candidate Ross Perot in 1992, famously asked in his opening statement: "Who am I. Why am I here." But one of the few debates to make a difference might have been Cheney's 2000 meeting with Senator Joseph Lieberman, where he was able to reassure voters of the Republican ticket's depth and gravitas. A poll released Monday by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that Edwards had a better image among voters than Cheney. Thirty-eight percent rated him favorably and 31 percent unfavorably; 37 percent had a positive view of Cheney and 42 percent were negative. Meanwhile, Bush and Kerry battled Monday over science, taxes and Iraq. The two rivals were tied in their race for the White House, each with 47 percent support among registered voters, a new New York Times/CBS News poll showed Tuesday. After signing legislation extending tax cuts, Bush said in the key up-for-grabs state of Iowa that Kerry would raise taxes on the US middle class and warned that his foreign policy would be "dangerous for world peace." Wooing voters in the battleground state of New Hampshire, Kerry accused Bush of choosing to "sacrifice science for extreme right-wing ideology" by restricting the use of government funds for stem-cell research. The two presidential candidates, next scheduled to face off in person on Friday, sized up polls showing Kerry clawing even with the Republican on the strength of his showing Thursday in their first of three televised debates. Two polls showed Bush clinging to a modest lead after the televised encounter, but three others called the race a virtual dead heat less than a month before the November 2 election. Bush, who lost Iowa by a hair in 2000, has a razor-thin edge there. Kerry and the president look tied in New Hampshire, which narrowly went to Bush in 2000. The Kerry campaign kept up the pressure on Monday, publishing a list of more than 180 former US ambassadors endorsing the Democrat, out of concern over the administration's foreign policy. Meanwhile, Bush redoubled his efforts to discredit Kerry as a potential commander in chief, pointing to the senator's vote against the 1991 Gulf War to oust Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. "The policies of my opponent are dangerous for world peace. If they were implemented they would make this world not more peaceful, but more dangerous," Bush told cheering supporters in Clive, Iowa. Kerry was joined in the eastern city of Hampton, New Hampshire by actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, as he blasted Bush's decision to limit publicly funded research using stem cells from human embryos.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Megawati urges Indonesians to accept presidential poll results.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An emotional Megawati Sukarnoputri on Tuesday urged Indonesia to accept the results of landmark polls which delivered a landslide victory to her former security minister, clearing his path to the presidency. Her speech, made to mark Indonesia's armed forces day, was the closest to conceding defeat Megawati has come since official results released Monday declared Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono the victor of the September 20 elections. "All sides should be able to accept (this) well, uphold the values of democracy and mutually respect each other," Megawati said. "We have to be able to show the world that our nation is a big nation and one of noble ethics," she said, visibly choking back tears. Yudhoyono, who will be sworn in as Indonesia's first democratically elected president on October 20, has so far declined to deliver a formal acceptance speech, saying he would wait until Megawati had made her declaration. The retired general, who won 60.62 percent of the votes against Megawati's 39.38 percent, was also present at the armed forces day ceremony at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma air base, but avoided direct comment on the poll result. Congratulations, led by US President George W. Bush, have already arrived for Yudhoyono, the preferred candidate among the international community which sees him as tough on Indonesia's growing problem of militant violence. "On behalf of the American people, President Bush congratulates Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on his victory in the Republic of Indonesia's presidential election," Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said. Indonesia has suffered three major terrorist strikes in two years under Megawati. Those attacks and others have been blamed on the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah regional terror group. Some 202 people died in the October 2002 Bali bombings, a car bomb strike on Jakarta's Marriott hotel in August 2003 left 12 dead, and nine were killed last month in an attack on Australia's Jakarta embassy. Yudhoyono faces tough challenges to fulfill his pre-poll pledges of revitalising an economy that enjoyed stability under Megawati but failed to show significant growth while unemployment remained high. He has also promised to combat the endemic corruption which has scared away vital foreign investment, although he may struggle to push through new legislation in a parliament where his political party is in minority. On Monday Yudhoyono sketched his blueprint for a new cabinet, promising it would be dominated by professionals who he would personally scrutinise for "capacity, integrity and dedication". Jakarta's markets reached new highs on Monday amid speculation of better economic times ahead, although gains were curbed on Tuesday amid profit taking. Financial monitors Fitch Ratings agency said it had raised the outlook on Indonesia's sovereign ratings to "positive" from "stable" to reflect diminished uncertainty following the election result and an improved outlook for reforms. Monday's official result drew a line under a marathon election year for Indonesia, with two rounds of presidential voting and legislative polls in April, which Megawati hailed as a "major achievement for our nation". Indonesia's emergence as the world's third largest democracy comes just six years after former president Suharto was forced to stand down, ending three decades of authoritarian rule. "We can be proud that we have successfully laid the foundation for a more democratic and stable nation and state that will be more capable of overcoming the challenge of this century," Megawati said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The former US governor of Iraq has admitted the United States "never" had enough ground troops in Iraq to establish firm control of the country, directly contradicting assertions by President George W. Bush and top Pentagon officials that the US military had what it needed. "We never had enough troops on the ground," Ambassador Paul Bremer told a conference of insurance professionals in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, Monday. He said the lack of adequate patrolling following the fall of Baghdad and other parts of the country to US troops had resulted in what he called "horrid" looting. "We paid a big price for not stopping it because it established an atmosphere of lawlessness," Bremer said. The remarks drew a stark contrast with repeated upbeat statements by Bush, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top administration officials, who have insisted the United States had enough forces in Iraq. About 133,000 US troops are currently deployed in Iraq as part of an international coalition that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein in 2003, claiming Iraq had illegal stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, according to top defense officials. Other coalition forces have a total of 23,500 in the country. None of the alleged stockpiles have ever been found. But Bremer said he agreed with Bush's decision to use force in Iraq because there was a "real possibility" Saddam Hussein might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups that have vowed to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. "The status quo was simply untenable," he insisted. "I am more than ever convinced that regime change was the right thing to do." He dismissed charges often voiced by Bush critics that the administration had no plans for post-war Iraq, but acknowledged that many of these plans were inadequate. "There was planning, but planning for a situation that didnt arise," he said, including a large-scale humanitarian or refugee crisis or the possibility that Saddam might blow up Iraqs oil fields and refineries. "Could it have been done better. the former Iraq administrator went on to ask. "Frankly, I didnt spend a lot of time looking back." He argued the Iraqi economy was on the rebound and he anticipated a considerable flow of foreign capital into the country once the security situation improved. In addition he expressed confidence Iraq's first democratic elections scheduled for late January will take place, despite violence raging across the country. "I believe the elections will happen," Bremer said. "They will be rough; there will be violence, but that is not unusual for initial elections in war-torn areas." He added he was overall "optimistic" about the future of Iraq.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Having tried bullet-proof versions of Thailand's three-wheel "tuk tuks" and armoured sentry-boxes, the Thai army has come up with a new security solution for troops in its restive south: the back-to-front motorbike team. Soldiers riding pillion have been told to sit facing backwards to counter the threat of separatist gunmen in the kingdom's Muslim-majority south. Some 315 people have been killed this year. Despite complaints from troops about the awkward riding position and difficulties keeping the bike upright, Thai Army General Palangoon Klaharn said it would be much safer for the men. "If we ride backwards, it will more difficult to be attacked or if it happens, we can respond immediately," Palangoon told AFP. He said the idea was the brainchild of Defence Minister Chetta Thanajaro. Chetta has also mooted banning pillion passengers among civilians after a two-man gun team on a motorcycle emerged as a favoured tactic of separatists following a resurgence in violence since January. But soldiers have complained about the new plans, even after adjusting footrests to help them keep balanced. "The pillion seat does not support the backward position. It is also difficult for the driver to make a turn because on a motorcycle this requires the driver and passenger to coordinate a weight shift," Sergeant Major Withaya Meechalee was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post. The initiative follows security measures in the south that have included armour-plated sentry boxes which soldiers complained were too hot to sit in and the conversion of Thailand's famous three-wheel taxis into armored vehicles.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova enters uncharted territory at the Japan Open this week when she will start as defending champion of a tennis tournament for the first time. The 17-year-old Russian starlet -- who stunned the tennis world with her maiden Grand Slam victory at the All England Club in July -- returns to the scene of her first WTA tournament triumph this week. And Sharapova said she was relishing the prospect of defending her crown. "It's the first time that I'm the defending champion of a tournament since last year was my first tournament that I won. It's a great feeling," said Sharapova, who admitted her successful season caught her by surprise. "All what had happened during last year, a lot of things I achieved at a young age, which were very unexpected, but it's an amazing feeling. I'm very excited to be back and defend my title." Sharapova has since enjoyed victories at Quebec City and Birmingham and trounced former world number one Serena Wiliams of the United States in the Wimbledon final. On Sunday, Sharapova, losing semi-finalist to Russia's US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in Beijing two weeks ago, defeated Marta Domachowska of Poland 6-1, 6-1 to win the Korea Open for her fifth career singles title. Sharapova dismissed suggestions that she might have skipped the 170,000-dollar tier three tournament after her rapid rise through the women's rankings. "As you win a title, of course, there are many great memories of winning, you just always want to come back to that place. I've always loved Japan and I've always loved Tokyo," said Sharapova. "I've been in Japan a few times now, actually maybe the fourth time in Tokyo, so I just love coming back, I love playing in front of Japanese fans. "It's an amazing vibe you get and sometimes that keeps you going, that keeps you wanting to win and play well. "Just because I won Wimbledon, it doesn't mean that I'm always going to win every single tournament. I'm 17 years old. There are so many things I have to learn, I have to beat top 10 players (to win a big tournament). "I didn't really expect to win Wimbledon so early, but I'm very happy that I did. It was an amazing experience. "Definitely I want to be number one and I want to win many more Grand Slams and I'd love to win Wimbledon many more times," added Sharapova when she was asked about her main goals.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A fleet of helicopters escorted by fighter jets flew Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai to a rare campaign rally outside Kabul Tuesday just days ahead of landmark elections. A crowd of around 5,000 people roared a welcome as he arrived at a public park amid tight security in the town of Ghazni, about 100 kilometres (63 miles) south of the capital. Karzai's first attempt to campaign beyond the capital was aborted after a rocket attack on his helicopter last month. This time, security was extremely tight, with Karzai's team of American bodyguards beefed up by truckloads of soldiers on the streets, roads blocked and heavy searches of everyone entering the gardens. The crowd carried posters with Karzai's picture and banners reading "Karzai is the symbol of unity". The US-backed Karzai is widely expected to win the October 9 elections against 17 other candidates. His main rival, former education minister Yunus Qanooni, was meanwhile campaigning at a rally in Kabul attended by around 2,000 people.]]></c>

"We condemn the killing of Abdul Aziz who was campaiging for us in Shindand," Qanooni told a rally of some 2,000 supporters in a Kabul football stadium, four days before the country's first direct presidential election. Qanooni is the chief rival to President Hamid Karzai. He did not say when Aziz was killed in Shindand, which lies 125 kilometers (78 miles) south of the main western city of Herat. Herat police chief Ziahuddin Muhmoodi said a body was discovered in Shindand but he could not say whether he had been campaigning for Qanooni. Qanooni also accused Karzai's followers of intimidating his supporters in the northern provinces of Kunduz and Baghlan by jailing them. "They threw our supporters into the jails. We condemn this act and we ask the UN and the government to release those people who have been sent to the jails for no reason but supporting us." He said the vote on Saturday will mark Afghanistan's "transition from dictatorship to democracy and elected government". Karzai, Qanooni, and 16 other candidates are contesting the election.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japanese share prices closed little changed but on a firmer tone Tuesday as continued modest support offset profit-taking on the previous day's sharp gains, dealers said. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index gained 2.20 points or 0.02 percent to 11,281.83, after surging 2.68 percent Monday, its second-largest gain of the year. The broader TOPIX index of all first section shares rose 0.67 points or 0.06 percent to 1,140.12. Advancing shares outnumbered decliners by 830 to 621, with 132 stocks unchanged, on sustained heavy turnover of 1.79 billion shares, down slightly from 1.83 billion the previous day. The modest gains were most prevalent in utility, land transport and telecommunications stocks, while the declines were seen among microchip equipment makers and banks. "As the market had already recouped the losses it sustained in the process of pricing in an economic slowdown in Japan, investors were feeling no more urge to continue short-covering," said Takayuki Suezaki, market analyst at Livedoor Securities. Tokyo Electron, Japan's second-largest maker of equipment for producing chips and liquid crystal displays, lost 70 yen or 1.2 percent to 5,590 yen, while Advantest, Japan's largest chip-testing equipment producer, fell 30 or 0.4 percent to 7,020. Japan's largest LCD panel maker, Sharp, declined 28 or 1.8 percent to 1,568. Game maker Nintendo was down 130 or 1.0 percent at 13,310, hit by profit-taking after its upgraded profit forecast failed to impress investors. Meanwhile, NTT, Japan's dominant telecommunications operator, rose 14,000 or 3.2 percent to 456,000 while KDDI, ranked second, closed up 3,000 or 0.6 percent at 549,000.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Japan defence shake-up bound to unsettle Asia: experts by Miwa Suzuki.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TOKYO, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Japanese moves to overhaul its 'defence-only' security policy that could enable it to launch pre-emptive strikes on foreign missile bases will trigger a wave of unease across Asia, security experts said Tuesday. In a report that will be the basis for new defence guidelines to be drawn up by the end of the year, an advisory panel to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said Monday that Japan should study acquiring pre-emptive strike capability. "Regarding the question of whether it is appropriate. to possess offensive capabilities against enemy missile bases as a last resort, a decision should be made after thoroughly examining the credibility of deterrence provided by the United States," the panel said in the report. Masashi Nishihara, president of Japan's state-run National Defence Academy, said it would be "no longer realistic to stick to the defence-only principle." "It is nonsense to say 'we will react after we've been attacked' at a time when we do not know when terror attacks will hit us," he said. Nishihara argued that Japan faces "more real threats than it did in the Cold War era" due to possible missile attacks by North Korea or China. The report did not name any countries as a possible security threat. Kazuto Suzuki, who teaches international politics at Tsukuba University, northeast of Tokyo, said it was a "landmark" report because it clearly stated that Japan should consider acquiring offensive capabilities. "If this is adopted as a government policy, it will be a great change in Japan's post-war defence policy," he said, noting the move stemmed from a US plan to realign its military forces globally. The report "declares Japan can no longer expect to depend solely on US forces for protection," Suzuki said. However, it was still impossible for Japan to launch pre-emptive strikes as it lacks intelligence, he said. Takashi Inoguchi, politics professor at the Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, said Japan aims to "have a deterrent by keeping the option of pre-emptive strikes open no matter whether it will actually do so." The analysts interviewed also said Japan should consider how its Asian neighbours would react when it adopts a new defense policy. "Diplomacy is important and Japan should give full consideration to Asian reactions," Nishihara said. "Although it will be wrong to do what they tell us to do at the expense of Japan's security." Suzuki said Japan needs to clearly define what "offensive capabilities" it would have and how they would be used to stave off any scepticism arising in Asia and elsewhere. Any suggestions that Japan is taking a higher military profile have unnerved China and other Asian countries that were invaded by Japan during World War II. Japan has adhered to defence-only security policy since its bitter defeat in the war under the 1947 war-renouncing constitution with its military now called the Self-Defence Forces. Koizumi convened the panel of 10 business executives, academics and former defence officials in April to map out defence strategies to cope with terrorist acts and the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Based on the panel's proposals, the Defence Agency plans to revise its 1995 defence strategy, which has been called into question following the September 11 terror attacks on US targets and growing terrorist threats. The report also urged the lifting a decades-old ban on weapons exports at least to the United States as Tokyo's research with Washington on missile defence is expected to enter a development phase soon. The conservative Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper hailed the report as "making a good start for a new defence plan" while The Tokyo Shimbun criticized it for "compromising post-war sanctuaries", such as the arms export ban.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Chechnya inaugurated its latest pro-Moscow leader Alu Alkhanov on Tuesday as tanks and gun-toting soldiers secured the shelled out rebel capital five years into the latest guerrilla war. The time and place of Alkhanov's inauguration in Grozny was kept secret until the last minute amid guerrilla threats to assassinate the next leader imposed on them by President Vladimir Putin through elections that they argue are staged. "I understand perfectly well that, coming to head the Chechen republic, where we are fighting fanatics and international terrorists, I have turned into public enemy number one for a various group of extremists," Alkhanov told Russia's Trud daily. "But this is not new to me -- I have already survived four assassination attempts and was attacked nearly a dozen times," he said. "If my own life was my prime concern, then I doubt I would have ever returned to this republic." A tall, mustachioed man of 47, Alkhanov served as Chechen interior minister and has gained broad respect in the republic for his ability to stay out of politics while trying to keep peace in one of the most restless spots on earth. But he was thrust onto Russia's political stage with the assassination on May 9 of the pro-Moscow Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov, a controversial but powerful former mufti whom Putin trusted to pull the republic back under Kremlin control. Kadyrov's death left a power vacuum in the Caucasian republic, with one of the strongest forces remaining in the hands of Kadyrov's burly son Ramzan, who runs Chechnya's feared security service that stands accused of abductions and other rights violations. But Ramzan, 28, is too young to stand in Chechen election, and Alkhanov emerged as the next logical choice, easily winning elections last August, in another controversial vote where his top challenger was barred from the race. "I am a member of Akhmad Kadyrov's team," Alkhanov told Trud. "We clear understand who must do what to lift the republic out of these ruins." Some of his more recent comments have been interpreted as more conciliatory toward the rebel resistance than the official Moscow stance. Alkhanov once said he was ready to stage talks with anyone as long as these led to peace -- seemingly breaking the Kremlin line that Moscow would never negotiate with "terrorists." Alkhanov qualified those comments in Tuesday's interview. "I did not say that I am ready to hold talks with (rebel leader) Aslan Maskhadov. I said that I am ready to speak to anyone, if this dialogue will lead to peace and security in the Chechen republic. "I propose to people who really want peace in our republic to apologize for all the suffering they caused to our people. "The people are tired of war and want to live in peace. It is time for the bandits to understand this and leave the people alone."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BOURNEMOUTH, England, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Michael Howard, the leader of Britain's opposition Conservative Party, will never become prime minister, an overwhelming 78 percent of respondants of a poll for the BBC said. The survey, released Monday at the start of the Conservatives' annual conference, showed that many also believed the Liberal Democrats had overtaken the Conservatives as the most effective opposition force to Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party. Twenty-two percent of respondants said the Tories were the most effective opposition party, compared to 42 percent for the Liberal Democrats. Only 12 percent of those polled predicted Howard would be elected prime minister in the next general election, which is expected to take place in the first half of 2005. Even among Conservative voters, the majority -- 65 percent -- told pollsters Howard would never get to lead the country. The Tory leader was to speak Tuesday to party loyalists at the conference in Bournemouth, south England. The gathering takes place as the party nurses its latest political rout, in a by-election last week in the northeast town of Hartlepool where Conservatives finished fourth, behind the UK Independence Party. The telephone poll for BBC Newsnight/ICM included 1,004 people aged 18 and over between October 1 and 3.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The kidnappers of a Jordanian man in Iraq have ordered his family to pay a 500,000-dollar ransom or send his employer to take his place, warning they would otherwise kill the hostage, his brother said Tuesday. "We have received five calls since Monday night from the kidnappers who are demanding a half-million-dollar ransom or that his employer Mohammed Sameh al-Ajluni take his place, otherwise they will kill him," Mohammad al-Ezza, brother of hostage Hisham Talab al-Ezza, told AFP. Ajluni himself said Monday that his transport firm Starlite was too small a company to pay such a large ransom, adding he had already complied with the demands of the kidnappers and halted operations in Iraq. The company's legal advisor Qassem Ali Obeid also went on Arab television on Sunday saying his firm was willing to negotiate with the unidentified abductors to win the release of their employee. On Saturday night a militant group in Iraq said it kidnapped Hisham and threatened to kill him within 72 hours unless Starlite ceased its operations in Iraq, in a videotape broadcast by the Al-Arabiya satellite news channel. The identity of the group was not revealed. Hisham's family have pleaded for his release, saying he was a father of six who went to Iraq four months ago simply to earn a living. They insisted he had no connection with US forces in the embattled country.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Chechnya swears in new pro-Russia leader (CORRECTS typo in slug).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MOSCOW, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Chechnya inaugurated its latest pro-Moscow leader Alu Alkhanov on Tuesday as tanks and gun-toting soldiers secured the shelled out rebel capital five years into the latest guerrilla war. The time and place of Alkhanov's inauguration in Grozny was kept secret until the last minute amid guerrilla threats to assassinate the next leader imposed on them by President Vladimir Putin through elections that they argue are staged. "I understand perfectly well that, coming to head the Chechen republic, where we are fighting fanatics and international terrorists, I have turned into public enemy number one for a various group of extremists," Alkhanov told Russia's Trud daily. "But this is not new to me -- I have already survived four assassination attempts and was attacked nearly a dozen times," he said. "If my own life was my prime concern, then I doubt I would have ever returned to this republic." A tall, mustachioed man of 47, Alkhanov served as Chechen interior minister and has gained broad respect in the republic for his ability to stay out of politics while trying to keep peace in one of the most restless spots on earth. But he was thrust onto Russia's political stage with the assassination on May 9 of the pro-Moscow Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov, a controversial but powerful former mufti whom Putin trusted to pull the republic back under Kremlin control. Kadyrov's death left a power vacuum in the Caucasian republic, with one of the strongest forces remaining in the hands of Kadyrov's burly son Ramzan, who runs Chechnya's feared security service that stands accused of abductions and other rights violations. But Ramzan, 28, is too young to stand in Chechen election, and Alkhanov emerged as the next logical choice, easily winning elections last August, in another controversial vote where his top challenger was barred from the race. "I am a member of Akhmad Kadyrov's team," Alkhanov told Trud. "We clear understand who must do what to lift the republic out of these ruins." Some of his more recent comments have been interpreted as more conciliatory toward the rebel resistance than the official Moscow stance. Alkhanov once said he was ready to stage talks with anyone as long as these led to peace -- seemingly breaking the Kremlin line that Moscow would never negotiate with "terrorists." Alkhanov qualified those comments in Tuesday's interview. "I did not say that I am ready to hold talks with (rebel leader) Aslan Maskhadov. I said that I am ready to speak to anyone, if this dialogue will lead to peace and security in the Chechen republic. "I propose to people who really want peace in our republic to apologize for all the suffering they caused to our people. "The people are tired of war and want to live in peace. It is time for the bandits to understand this and leave the people alone."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Billion-dollar fighter jet contract to figure in French leader's talks.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[French President Jacques Chirac will visit Singapore on Wednesday seeking to enhance historically warm bilateral ties, with France's efforts to secure a billion-dollar contract for the Rafale fighter jet high on the agenda. Chirac's spokesman, Jerome Bonnafont, told a news conference in Paris the French leader would raise the Rafale issue during a three-hour stopover here on his way to an Asia-Europe summit in Hanoi. Chirac is scheduled to meet newly installed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew, who is Lee's father and Minister Mentor, at the Istana government complex. Observers said terrorism, closer Asia-Europe ties and the situation in the Middle East were expected to figure in the discussions. But the highest profile bilateral issue to be discussed will be France's efforts to supply the Dassault Aviation-manufactured Rafale jet to Singapore. The wealthy city-state has short-listed the Rafale, Boeing's F-15 Eagle and Europe's Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its squadron of Skyhawk combat aircraft in a deal expected to be worth more than one billion US dollars. Singapore Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean has said a decision on the contract for about 20 jets would be announced early next year. All three aircraft were evaluated in Singapore this year. The French government is the only customer to have purchased the Rafale since its launch in 1988, and Singapore is the only foreign country to have pre-selected the aircraft for possible purchase. Amid intense lobbying from rival parties, France is hoping that its close political, economic and defence ties with the island-republic will boost its chances. In a commentary piece published in the Straits Times on Tuesday, Chirac did not mention the Rafale bid but said he wanted to visit Singapore to emphasise France's commitment to maintaining more than 30 years of warm bilateral ties. "It is only natural for me to come and meet him (PM Lee) in order to show France's determination in continuing our relations with Singapore, which are based on friendship, trust and partnership," Chirac wrote. Chirac highlighted the two nations' strong business links. Singapore is France's third largest partner in Asia after Japan and China and there are 420 French companies based here. In 2003, two-way trade between Singapore and France totalled 4.5 billion euros (3.75 billion US dollars). On the military front, France hosts training facilities for Singapore air force pilots at its Cazaux Air Base under a defence cooperation agreement signed in 1998. The French firm Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN) is also helping Singapore build frigates with radar-evading stealth capabilities under a technology transfer scheme. Chirac is expected to arrive in Singapore at 9:30 am (0130 GMT) on Wednesday and leave at 12:30 pm for Hanoi to attend a summit of Asian and European leaders. The French leader is also scheduled to visit China from October 9-12. Although Chirac has no scheduled meetings with the French business community here, French corporate executives hope the "goodwill" generated by his trip will translate into more opportunities not only in Singapore but also in Asia. "Many French companies use Singapore as a gateway to Asia, especially China which is a market unto itself," a French business executive told AFP.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Hong Kong vets are preparing to move the city's celebrity crocodile out of quarantine and onto public display, wildlife experts said Tuesday. After being kept in a purpose-built home at Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden since June 23, the public will finally be able to catch a glimpse of the 1.5-metre (five-foot) reptile, called "Pui Pui" in Chinese or "The Public's Treasure". The croc is expected to draw a big crowd when it enters a fenced-off section of a lake at the farm, said Ann Houng, education officer at Kadoorie Farm. "We've received a lot more inquiries than usual from the public who want to see Pui Pui. I believe a lot of people will turn up to see her," she said. Houng said although the croc has only eaten five times since she was captured it is considered healthy. Crocodiles are not native to Hong Kong and Pui Pui became an instant celebrity when she first appeared in a stream in the northern polluted New Territories in November. The reptile spent eight months on the run despite the efforts of an Australian crocodile hunter and locals, but was finally captured on June 10.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TAIPEI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Taiwanese intelligence and security officials took a close interest in the development of what rival China sees as a spy satellite, a report said Tuesday. Taiwan says the satellite, which was launched in May in the United States, is intended to monitor the island's land mass and surrounding waters, and study atmospheric conditions. China fears the satellite, designed to transmit high-resolution photos of areas as small as two meters, could be used for military purposes. The China Times quoted an unidentified offical as saying that national security authorities had sent staff to meetings and voiced demands on collecting information while the satellite was still on the drawing board. It also quoted a note about the satellite which was made by the then-top intelligence chief, Yin Tsung-wen, in 1999. The note read: "German company delays ROCSAT-2". Yin made the note two months before Taiwan's government confirmed that under pressure from Beijing the German government might forbid a German company to manufacture the satellite. Taiwan eventually scrapped the contract with the German firm and gave it to Astrium of France. The 750-kilogram (1,650-pound), with a lifespan of five years, is in a 890 kilometer-high (480 nautical mile) orbit. The total cost of the project is 4.7 billion Taiwan dollars (1.18 billion US). Taiwan in October 1991 launched a 15-year space program at an estimated cost of 19.6 billion dollars. Military analysts said that without its own spy satellite, Taiwan could hardly establish a functional missile defence system. China has some 600 short-range ballistic missiles, mostly deployed in coastal provinces facing Taiwan, according to Taiwanese officials. Since pro-independence president Chen Shui-bian was re-elected in March, Beijing has stressed its long-standing vow to take Taiwan by force should it declare formal independence.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Marks and Spencer on Tuesday announced it had acquired the "per una" clothing brand for 125 million pounds (182 million euros, 223 million dollars), in a deal the group hopes will help to lift falling sales. Marks' chief executive Stuart Rose announced in July that it intended to buy the brand as part of a strategy that eventually helped to thwart a 9.1-billion-pound takeover bid for the group by retail tycoon Philip Green. "Marks and Spencer today announces that it has acquired per una from George Davies for a consideration of 125 million pounds (182 million euros, 223 million dollars) for the business, being the company, the brand and people," Marks said in a statement. Davies, former boss of Marks' clothing rival Next, was to remain as chief executive of per una for at least two years, it added. Last month, Marks reported a sharp fall in summer sales of clothing as it lost market share to rivals, dismaying investors looking for a recovery at the century-old retailer. The former darling of the British high street is struggling to compete with smaller fashion chains such as Next and supermarket giants like Tesco and Asda, which recently overtook Marks to become Britain's biggest clothing retailer. Yet the more stylish per una brand has proved to be a hit with Marks' customers. Per una was introduced into Marks and Spencer stores three years ago as a way of attracting younger shoppers to its clothing ranges and is now stocked in 173 of its branches.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A confidential report from the post-Saddam Hussein Iraqi government alleges that an inspector contracted by the United Nations through a Dutch company was bribed 104,000 dollars (84,800 euros) to falsify documents in an oil-smuggling scheme, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The newspaper said the scheme has netted the former Iraqi regime nine million dollars. The alleged bribing of an employee of Saybolt International BV, which is based in Vlaardingen, is described in a February report by Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization, which details corruption in the UN's oil-for-food program, the Journal said. Under the program, Iraq was allowed to sell oil under UN auspices and use most of the revenue to purchase humanitarian goods. Saybolt was hired by the United Nations to monitor Iraqi oil exports under the program. The report suggests the unnamed Saybolt inspector was bribed to falsify documents that understated the amount of oil loaded on two tankers in 2000 and 2001, the paper said. The cargoes together included an extra 500,000 barrels of crude that were sold outside the UN program, with most of the proceeds going directly to the Iraqi regime, according to the Journal. "Our information indicates that the bribery of the individual working for the Dutch company Saybolt to pay for his falsifying documents cost 104,000 dollars," the paper quoted the report as saying. It concludes that the forgery scheme was ordered personally by Saddam Hussein and carried out by "several groups of highly ranked people," according to the paper. A spokesman for Saybolt said the company was investigating the allegations.]]></c>

In a rare, last-minute change in the presidential schedule, Bush has scrapped a planned talk on medical liability and instead will give what the White House called a "significant speech" about the two central issues of the campaign -- the war on terrorism and the economy, the newspaper said. The president is said to be eager to rebut Kerry's attacks on such issues, especially those that came during last Thursday's presidential debate, according to The Times. "There has been an attempt by the president's opponent to launch false attacks and mislead the American people on these big priorities," the paper quotes White House press secretary Scott McClellan as saying.

		<d><![CDATA[COLOMBO, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Tamil Tiger rebels on Tuesday rejected Sri Lanka's latest peace initiative as a "time wasting tactic" as Norway warned the insurgents to stop killing political opponents. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said the National Advisory Council for Peace and Reconciliation, launched by President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Monday to try to broaden the peace process, did not address their demands. Tiger political wing leader S. P. Thamilselvan told the BBC's Tamil-language service that many committees had been formed by successive governments but none had tackled their demands. Thamilselvan, speaking from Geneva, described the council as a "time-wasting tactic" and said stalled peace negotiations could resume on the basis of the LTTE's proposal for an "Interim Self-Governing Authority," or self-rule. "There is also a widespread campaign against us saying we are creating hurdles for the revival of the peace process, which is totally untrue," Thamilselvan said. Peace broker Norway urged the Tigers to stop killing their rivals and warned that the spate of attacks undermined a fragile truce arranged by Oslo and put in place since February 2002. Norway's deputy foreign minister Vidar Helgesen expressed "growing concern" over political assassinations blamed on the LTTE, the Norwegian embassy said in a statement. Helgesen, a key figure in brokering peace on the island, conveyed Oslo's concerns to Thamilselvan who is leading a Tiger delegation to Europe to drum up support for the self-rule plan. "Mr. Helgesen stated that Norway condemns the political killings taking place in Sri Lanka and appealed to the (Tiger) delegation that the LTTE does everything possible to stop such killings," the statement said. Tiger guerrillas have been accused of killing over 250 of their rivals during the ceasefire. Kumaratunga on Monday invited Tigers to start talks on establishing a federal state to end ethnic bloodshed. She said she hoped to consult wider public opinion on peace-related issues through the advisory council despite a boycott by the main opposition parties in parliament. The president said her government was committed peacefully to resolving the conflict that has claimed over 60,000 lives since 1972 and urged the LTTE to resume negotiations. The government was ready to discuss the setting up of an interim administration for the island's embattled regions as demanded by the rebels, but there should be parallel talks on a final peace deal, she said. Both the LTTE and the previous Colombo government, during direct talks in Oslo in December 2002, agreed to adopt a federal structure to devolve power to Sri Lanka's minority Tamils in exchange for peace.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[A ground-to-air missile used in shoulder launchers has been found in one of seven arms caches in southwest France uncovered in weekend raids against suspected members of Spain's armed Basque separatist group ETA, a French official said Tuesday. The missile was discovered along with a large amount of explosive material in a house under construction in the town of Urrugne, near the Spanish border, the official said on condition of anonymity. Seventeen people, including Mikel "Antza" Albizu Iriarte, ETA's political leader and chief theoretician, and his girlfriend, Soledad "Anboto" Iparragirre Genetxea, a suspected former military chief of the group, were arrested in the region Sunday in swoops by French anti-terrorist officers. Spanish officials said they arrested another four suspects on their side of the border the same day. Three of the suspects arrested in France were released Monday and the 14 others remain in custody, the French official said, adding that searches of the arms caches were continuing and would "take several days". The official said experts were examining the missile to determine where it was made and how it might have been acquired by ETA. According to the Spanish newspaper El Diario Vasco, the separatist group is believed to have several SAM-7 missiles able to blast low-flying aircraft out of the sky, according to documents found in previous raids. ETA has been waging a bloody campaign for an independent homeland in parts of northern Spain and southwestern France since 1959. It has been blamed for the deaths of 817 people in that time, according to a toll published Monday by Spain's El Pais daily. Both Spain and France hailed Sunday's raids against the group as a "historic" victory.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[India's Reliance Industries and its Canadian partner Niko Resources are to invest more than two billion dollars to bring to their gigantic gas field in the Bay of Bengal into production, a report said Tuesday. About half the cost would be for laying pipelines to transport the fuel, a senior Niko executive told the Press Trust of India news agency. "We will invest one billion dollars in staged development of D6 deep-water gas reserves (off the coast of Andhra Pradesh state) and in excess of a billion dollars in building pipelines," PTI cited Niko Resources executive chairman Edward S. Sampson as saying. Reliance Industries Ltd., operator of D6 in the Krishna Godavari basin, expects first gas by late 2006 or early 2007. "We expect gas production of one billion cubic feet," Sampson said, adding US consultant Degolyer and MacNaughton had assessed the in-place gas reserves in the first 10 wells in D6 at 11 trillion cubic feet. Additional gas reserves have been found in two subsequent wells in the block, Sampson said adding a 13th well was being drilled on the block. Reliance has sought government approval for the development of Dhirubhai-I and III fields in the D6 block at an investment of one billion dollars. A similar amount would be spent on laying a pipeline from Kakinada on Andhra Pradesh coast to the company's first customer, National Thermal Power Corp's power plants in Gujarat, the report said. "We anticipate the work to start by early 2005," Sampson said.]]></c>

Unemployment usually decreases at this time of year at the start of the school term and as factories re-open after the summer holidays. Taking such seasonal factors into consideration, the number of people claiming dole in Germany rose by 27,000 to 4.445 million in September from August, separate data published by the Bundesbank in Frankfurt showed. It was the ninth month in a row that the seasonally adjusted jobless total has risen. "Economic developments in Germany remain positive. But there is no sign of an improvement yet on the labour market. The recovery is not yet strong enough to reduce unemployment," said labour agency chief Frank Weise. In regional terms, the seasonally adjusted jobless total in western Germany increased by 12,000 to 2.822 million and the jobless rate remained unchanged at 8.6 percent. In the former communist east, the adjusted jobless total was up by 15,000 at September and the jobless rate increased to 18.7 percent from 18.6 percent the previous month.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Prime Minister Iyad Allawi was due to address Iraq's interim parliament on Tuesday after a trip to Britain and the United States where he met the leaders of both countries and spoke at the United Nations about Iraq's future. The premier landed in Baghdad late Monday after about two-and-a-half weeks away, during which time US and Iraqi forces carried out one of their largest post-war offensives and insurgents launched some of their bloodiest attacks. Allawi was due to address Iraq's newly-appointed interim National Council to give a summary of his trip and discuss progress towards nationwide elections planned for January and ongoing reconstruction efforts, an official said. On his first trip since taking office to the main Western powers behind last year's invasion of Iraq, Allawi spent several days in London where he met British counterpart Tony Blair. Flying on to the United States, Allawi reiterated his resolve to hold elections, despite escalating violence on the ground, in an address to the US Congress and after talks with top ally US President George W. Bush. Allawi also pushed the theme of international aid, notably urging states to make good on promised but undelivered funds for reconstruction. He made an impassioned appeal to world leaders in a speech at the UN General Assembly to put aside their differences over the war and help rebuild his shattered nation. Iraqi officials have long complained that little of the 33 billion dollars (27 billion euros) pledged last year for reconstruction in Iraq, including 18.4 billion dollars from the United States, has been allocated. Japan is hosting a new donors' conference for Iraq in Tokyo October 13-14. At the UN Assembly, the hawkish leader asked in particular for international support in the fight against the "terrorists" he said were trying to wreak havoc in Iraq after the ouster of Saddam Hussein. Desperate to crush the insurgency and enable elections to take place across the country, US and Iraqi troops on Friday thrust into the rebel bastion of Samarra, north of Baghdad, killing close to 150 people, mainly insurgents.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[HARARE, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President Robert Mugabe and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni have buried the hatchet over the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo that saw their armies backing opposing factions. "I came here to show you that we are brothers and, historically speaking, we are on the same side. I am most pleased to be here," said Museveni at a lavish dinner hosted for him by Mugabe at his official residence late Monday night. "In spite of the little misunderstanding we had on Congo with the leaders of Zimbabwe. we have always worked together," Museveni said. Mugabe reciprocated by saying that with the "DRC conflict behind us", it was time to "further cement our strong bonds of cooperation". "Happily those bonds that bring us together remained stronger than the transient misunderstanding that we went through and we are back to our normal relations," said Mugabe. Museveni arrived Monday for his first visit to Zimbabwe since the end of the war in DRC, which began in August 1998 and formally ended last year. Uganda sided with Rwanda in backing rebels fighting to topple the government of late DRC president Laurent Kabila. Zimbabwe deployed up to 12,000 troops to prop up Kabila's government. "Even in well-knit families, differences do occur from time to time," said Mugabe. "It is in this context that our two countries found themselves on opposing sides during the ugly conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo," he said. The 1998-2003 war in the Democratic Republic of Congo drew in six countries at its height, with Angola, Chad, Namibia and Zimbabwe backing Kinshasa while Rwanda and Uganda supported rebel groups. Dubbed Africa's world war, the conflict claimed an estimated 2.5 million lives, some killed in combat while others died of hunger and disease. Museveni is leading a high-profile delegation including businessmen to discuss a wide range of issues such as trade with Zimbabwe, which is in the throes of an economic crisis triggered in part by Mugabe's 2000 land reform program in which thousands of white-owned farms were seized and distributed to landless blacks.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korea on Tuesday called for an early end to controversy over its secret nuclear experiments, saying it was hindering efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons drive. Unification Minister Chung Dong-Young expressed the wish in a meeting with Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Chung's office said. ElBaradei is in Seoul to attend an anti-nuclear weapons forum while his inspectors are investigating Seoul's unauthorized experiments to produce plutonium and enriched uranium -- essential ingredients for atomic bombs. South Korea insists the lab experiments were purely for scientific purposes, not linked to nuclear weapons programs, but IAEA inspectors last month visited the country twice and are expected to visit again soon. ElBaradei has expressed "serious concern" about South Korea's nuclear activities. The Vienna-based UN watchdog will hold a meeting of its board of directors in November to determine whether the matter ought to be referred to the UN Security Council. "We hope the case will be closed at the IAEA meeting of directors in November and will not be referred to the UN Security Council," Chung told the IAEA chief, his office said. Chung warned that a further delay in resolving the case would affect talks to end the two-year impasse over North Korea's nuclear ambitions. "It's up to the meeting but we will do our utmost to avoid (having the case being referred to the UN)," ElBaradei was quoted as saying. The UN watchdog wants South Korea to come clean about its past unauthorized nuclear experiments and not to repeat its mistake. The case has embarrassed the United States and South Korea when they are trying, through six-party talks, to pressure Stalinist North Korea to end its nuclear weapons drive. North Korea refused to take part in a fourth round of the multilateral talks, scheduled for last month, blaming what it called hostile US policy and the secret nuclear experiments. The North's attitude prompted South Korea to make a fresh pledge that it would not develop or possess nuclear weapons and would pursue research transparently. South Korea said its scientists produced 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of uranium metal in 1982 in undeclared activities and a small amount of that was used in 2000 to produce a microscopic amount of enriched uranium. The scientists also admitted to having extracted a miniscule amount of plutonium from 2.5 kilograms of fuel rods in secret research in 1982. South Korea has the world's sixth-largest civilian nuclear industry, operating 19 power plants that produce 40 percent of the country's energy needs.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ABIDJAN, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two French judges were in Ivory Coast's economic capital Abidjan Tuesday to conduct investigations into the disappearance six months ago of Franco-Canadian journalist Guy-Andre Kieffer, a source close to the inquiry has said. Judges Patrick Ramael and Emmanuelle Ducos arrived here on Sunday and are expected to remain in the west African country for around two weeks, the source said. Kieffer, a correspondent for the biweekly French-language newsletter La Lettre du Continent devoted to African affairs, vanished without a trace on April 16. The last time he was seen was in the car park of a supermarket in Abidjan. Kieffer was an expert on cocoa, of which Ivory Coast is the largest producer in the world. Ramael has already travelled twice to Ivory Coast, in May and June, to probe the journalist's disappearance. Only one person has been arrested in connection with Kieffer's disappearance: Michel Legre, the brother-in-law of President Laurent Gbagbo's wife, Simone, with whom Kieffer was due to meet on the afternoon he vanished. In 10 hours of interrogation of Legre in May, Ramael extracted the names of some of the president's closest advisers in connection with the disappearance. They included Gbagbo's spiritual adviser, Pastor Moses Kore; former defense minister Bertin Kadet; Aubert Zohore, director of the office of Economy and Finance Minister Paul Antoine Bohoun Bouabre; and Victor Nembelissini, head of the national investment bank. All have denied involvement in the abduction of the 54-year-old father of three, with Kadet going so far as to file a libel suit against Legre. Legre was charged in May with being an accomplice to kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and murder, and is in detention. In August, French police, armed with a warrant issued by Ramael, searched the home near Paris of Leonard Guede-Pepe, also known as James Cenach, a close collaborator of the Ivorian finance minister.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[British drinks giant Diageo on Tuesday said it had raised 2.26 billion dollars (1.84 billion euros) from the sale of 49.9 million shares in US food company General Mills Inc. Diageo had announced Monday its intention to dispose of part of its 21-percent stake in General Mills. A total 16.5 million of the shares, each priced at 45.20 dollars, were repurchased by the US group, Diageo said in a statement. "Today's transaction represents one of the last steps on our strategic journey to build the world's leading premium drinks business," Diageo chief executive Paul Walsh said. Diageo said it would use the proceeds to reduce its debt pile, estimated at 4.5 billion pounds. The group was to retain 25 million General Mills shares.

		<c><![CDATA[Indonesia and Malaysia will begin a joint naval exercise on Wednesday as part of their efforts to prevent piracy and terrorism in the strategic Strait of Malacca, state media reported Tuesday. "This is a routine activity and indirectly it is a way of anticipating terrorist movements in this area," First Admiral Mukhlas Sidik said in Batam, the Indonesian island bordering Singapore, according to the state news agency Antara. He said the Strait of Malacca would "obtain a peaceful impact" from the biennial exercise involving four Malaysian warships and four from Indonesia. The narrow 960-kilometre (600 mile) Malacca Strait, which runs along the coasts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, carries about half the world's oil supplies and a third of global trade. Fears that terrorists could hijack a tanker and turn it into a floating weapon prompted the three countries to launch trilateral patrols in July, a move the Indonesian navy said had reduced piracy attacks in the area. Data from the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre in Kuala Lumpur showed that Indonesian waters remained the world's most pirate-infested in the first three months of this year, accounting for 21 of the 79 attacks worldwide. Smugglers also operate in the waters between the neighbouring countries. The exercise, including mine-clearing exercises, ends Friday.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[US withdrawal would help Iraqi democracy: Italian minister.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ROME, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The withdrawal of United States and other allied forces from Iraq would help the democratic process there, Italian Defence Minister Antonio Martino said in an interview published Tuesday. Asked about a statement by US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on withdrawal, Martino told the newspaper La Stampa Rumsfeld had "begun to anticipate what the Iraqi government had asked of the Americans" and their allies in the coalition, who include Italy. Rumsfeld suggested last month the US could begin to withdraw troops from Iraq before the country was at peace. "Both Prime Minister Iyad Allaoui and his Deputy Defence Minister Al Jabati, whom I recently met, have outlined to us how much the withdrawal of coalition forces would help Baghdad," Martino said in his interview: "It would strengthen the government and democratisation." The withdrawal would not affect humanitarian and military aid, or the training and equipping of the Iraqi police and army, he said. On Monday Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini suggested the possibility of the 3,000-strong Italian contingent being withdrawn from Iraq, without giving any deadline. Speaking on September 24 after meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, Rumsfeld said: "Any implication that that place has to be peaceful and perfect before we can reduce coalition and US forces would obviously be, I think, unwise because it has never been peaceful and perfect, and it isn't likely to be." His comments were in contrast to President George W. Bush's vow to "stay the course" in Iraq as well as the administration's broader effort to portray the situation in Iraq as one of steady progress despite an onslaught of insurgent violence. Frattini said on Monday that forces from Muslim countries should gradually take over from troops of the US-led coalition. "We should tell our Arab friends that. there is a process of political stabilisation guided by the UN and that we need a commitment on the ground from Muslim nations," Frattini said in an interview with the newspaper Corriere della Sera. "We have to seek a gradual transition from the present multinational force to majority Muslim multinational contingents," he said.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SYDNEY, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Reserve Bank of Australia board held its monthly monetary policy meeting Tuesday, with analysts writing off any chance of an interest rate rise just four days out from an October 9 general election. Economists said the central bank was almost certain to leave interest rates at 5.25 percent when it announces the results of its meeting Wednesday morning, although they said rates could rise before the end of the year. Interest rates have been a central issue in the election campaign as both sides appeal to swinging voters in the 'mortgage belts' of Australia's major cities. Any move to tighten monetary policy so close to an election would be seen as politically motivated. HSBC senior economist Anthony Thompson said the strength of the Australian economy meant rates were likely to go up, but not before December. "Our view is we have two more rate hikes," Thompson said. "At this stage there is one for December and then one for the first quarter of next year, but a lot can change between now and then." Westpac strategist Justin McCarthy said Australia's property market, which prompted rate rises in November and December last year, appeared to have cooled but now the stock market was racking up fresh record highs and may need to be slowed. "It looks like property might not be the place to be at the moment, but the sharemarket is," he said. "That is the risk you run if you are running policy too easy, the asset bubble just moves to another sector and that is exactly what happened in the US." The conservative Liberal-National coalition has claimed interest rates will rise if the opposition Labor Party wins office, but economists have warned big-spending election pledges from both parties are the more likely to over stimulate the economy and force up the cost of borrowing.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ALMATY, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Kazakhstan said Tuesday it was pushing ahead with efforts to buy a stake owned by gas group BG in the "super-giant" Kashagan offshore oil field even though several Western oil majors have interests in the reserves. This former Soviet republic announced earlier this year that it hoped to buy the 16.67-percent interest owned by BG (formerly British Gas) in the seven-member ENI-led consortium working at Kashagan. "There's understanding in relation to this question -- we've begun constructively looking at various compromise possibilities that should satisfy both sides, in particularly Kazakhstan," Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Vladimir Shkolnik was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying on Tuesday. Kashagan, in the Caspian Sea, is reportedly the world's fourth-largest oil field. It is estimated to contain 45 billion barrels (5.8 billion tonnes) of oil, of which between eight billion barrels and 13 billion barrels are currently considered recoverable. Ownership is currently divided between ENI, BG, TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil and Shell -- with 16.67 percent each -- as well as ConocoPhillips and Inpex with smaller stakes. The precise effect of Kazakhstan's ownership ambitions remains unclear. But relations between the Kazakh state and the consortium are known to have been rocky. People familiar with the matter have said that other consortium members had wanted to divide BG's stake among themselves in order to ease the currently cumbersome decision-making process. Earlier this year Kazakhstan said that the consortium had agreed to pay a 150-million-dollar (125-million-euro) fine for delaying the start of production at Kashagan from 2005 until 2007 or 2008. The consortium is set to invest about 20 billion dollars in Kashagan over its first 20 years.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korea's military authorities said Tuesday they expected that China would inevitably be drawn into any war on the Korean peninsula because of a mutual assistance treaty with North Korea. "China is expected to provide limited military support (to North Korea) according to a provision of the mutual assistance treaty stipulating automatic engagement," Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Kim Jong-Hwan told a parliamentary hearing. China would deploy some 400,000 troops in support of North Korea in case of war with South Korea, backed by its ally the United States, according to Joint Chiefs of Staff data provided to the hearing. China's support would include 800 aircraft and 150 navy vessels, according to the JCS data. The South Korea-US combined troops number 720,000 while North Korea's regular military total 1.17 million on top of 6.34 million reserve forces, according to the data. North Korean troops backed by Chinese forces fought against South Korean and US-led UN forces during the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in stalemate following Pyongyang's suprise invasion of the south. The JCS chief told the parliamentary hearing that this time round a surprise North Korean invasion of the south would not work. He said the South Korea-US combined forces had a defensive plan that would allow them to "quickly repel and destroy North Korean attacks on South Korea". South Korea has also devised detailed plans concerning another possible scenario -- the collapse of North Korea, according to a media report. Under the secret plans, Seoul would speedily move to take control of North Korea and be able to accommodate at least 200,000 refugees flooding out of the Stalinist state. The JoongAng Ilbo, a major Seoul daily, said that under the plans disclosed at a parliamentary audit on Monday Seoul's unification minister would take over as ruler of post-collapse North Korea. South Korea has also designated public facilities such as schools and stadiums nationwide to house more than 200,000 North Koreans exp were discussed in the parliamentary hearing at the request of an opposition Grand National Party lawmaker, the newspaper said. Under one plan, code-named "Chungmu 9000," South Korea would establish an emergency administrative headquarters in North Korea following the collapse of the communist regime. South Korea's unification minister would head the agency and would dispose of powers greater than a governor, according to the newspaper. Under a separate "Chungmu 3300" plan, South Korea would prepare for a massive influx of refugees and would also evacuate any South Koreans from the North.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Inflation spike raises fears of monetary tightening in the Philippines (ADDS officials' comments).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MANILA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Philippines inflation jumped to 7.2 percent in September, sparking concerns the authorities may have to raise interest rates just when the government needs all the help it can get to keep the economy growing, official figures showed Tuesday. Core inflation, which excludes short-term variations, rose 6.6 percent. "This shows that inflationary pressures are becoming more permanent than transitory," said Economic Planning Secretary Romulo Neri, who predicted the September level was likely to be maintained for the rest of the year due to rising oil prices. As a result, Neri said the government now expects 2004 inflation to come in at 5.4 percent, well above its target of 4.0-5.0 percent. The September figures, 0.4 percentage points above August, pushed the annualised figure to 5.2 percent using 2000 as the base reference point. "The central bank may look at that option (of raising interest rates) after the November (2) US presidential election," said Jonathan Ravelas, analyst of Banco De Oro. Using prices with 1994 as a base, inflation rose 6.9 percent year-on-year in September, its fastest rate in five years as the country, already facing what President Gloria Arroyo has recognised as a fiscal crisis, paid the penalty on high oil prices. Philippine shares were weaker Tuesday, a day after market hit a 55-month high, as the inflation figures raised concerns over higher interest rates. The composite index closed down 11.06 points or 0.60 percent at 1,840.54. "If inflation breaches the 7.0 percent level (using the 1994 base year), that could trigger the central bank to finally increase rates," said Jose Vistan of AB Capital Securities. At its last meeting on September 23, the central bank's monetary board kept key interest rates unchanged at their lowest levels in 12 years despite a quarter percentage point increase in the US federal funds rate. Overnight rates have been kept steady for over a year now at 6.75 percent for borrowing and 9.00 percent for lending. The central bank already expects inflation to exceed the government's targets for this year and 2005 due to supply-side pressures while recognising the risk that raising interest rates will only harm the economy. The central bank stuck to this theme on Tuesday. "The (higher inflation) was expected. It is supply-driven with the pressure coming from oil, power and food," said assistant central bank governor Diwa Guinigundo. He said the monetary board is looking at demand-side pressures, capital flows and exchange rates before considering any shift in policy. The International Monetary Fund said in a recent report that "there was a case for monetary tightening given that world interest rates (are) rising." It said that new tax measures and higher electricity rates proposed by President Arroyo to trim the budget deficit "would exert further upward pressure on inflation." There was better news elsewhere Tuesday as the government reported 13.7 percent export growth to 3.415 billion dollars, bringing the year so far increase to 8.5 percent at 25.25 billion dollars. Exports of electronics products, which accounted for 65.9 percent of all September shipments, rose 15.7 percent to 2.25 billion dollars. Within this category, semiconductors were up 14.8 percent to 1.59 billion dollars. "For this year, we expect our export growth to be 10-11 percent," Trade Secretary Cesar Purisima said in a statement. The figures defied earlier forecasts of a continuing sluggish export performance amid an expected slowdown in global demand for electronics. o publish its latest annual reports on EU candidate states on Wednesday, will say that Romania now has a market economy able to withstand the competitive pressures inside the bloc, according to the diplomatic source. Bulgaria has already been deemed to have a functioning market economy.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[FRANKFURT, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The head of Volkswagen, Bernd Pischetsrieder, again threatened Tuesady to move jobs abroad as management sat down with unions to discuss wage talks at a time when Europe's biggest car maker is seeking to impose steep cost cuts on its workforce. "It's not about merely boxing things through. What we want is to secure jobs in Germany," VW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder told the regional daily Berliner Zeitung in an interview. "That is vital if the relocation of labour abroad is not to increase," Pischetsrieder added. VW management had previously issued a veiled threat to relocate jobs abroad or increase production outside of Germany if it failed to push through substantial cost-cutting plans aimed at reducing production costs by 30 percent by 2011. The same tactic had been used by German-US rival DaimlerChrysler recently to persuade its workforce to agree to tough belt-tightening measures. At VW, management and unions were set to return to the negotiating table on Tuesday in on-going wage talks following a two-week break. With both sides taking an increasingly confrontational stance, the powerful IG Metall labour union did not rule out calling for work stoppages or even an all-out strike. Pischetsrieder, however, appeared conciliatory. "Neither side is interested in a strike. Both sides will do everything they can to reach a peaceful agreememt," he told the newspaper. Faced with falling sales, VW is wanting to freeze the wages of its 103,000 production employees in Germany and make working hours more flexible. IG Metall for its part is demanding a four-percent pay increase and job guarantees for 10 years.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Indian state keen for US bomb experts to tackle insurgency in northeast.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[GUWAHATI, India, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The chief minister of the troubled northeastern Indian state of Assam said Tuesday his government was keen to enlist US help, especially from bomb disposal experts, to tackle growing militancy. Tarun Gogoi said he favoured US inputs after violence exploded at the weekend leaving 69 people dead in a string of bomb blasts and gunfire in Assam and neighbouring Nagaland. Gogoi has blamed the outlawed National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) for the attacks in Assam. "We would be seeking the permission of India's foreign ministry to bring in experts from the United States to help our security agencies in battling a rise in terrorist strikes in the region," Gogoi told reporters. David C. Mulford, the US ambassador to India, had earlier written to the chief minister offering the expertise of American bomb squads. "The United States has considerable expertise in investigative techniques in areas such as forensic analysis of explosive residues," said Mulford in his letter. "Should you find it helpful, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would be pleased to provide technical support for your investigation," the letter added. Gogoi said he was optimistic New Delhi would clear the proposal. "We definitely need help to battle insurgency and I am hopeful New Delhi will give us the nod for enlisting the help of the US experts," Gogoi said. "We would see to it that national security is not compromised in our efforts to rope in foreign experts in countering militancy." In March and April this year, Indian and US troops held low-intensity combat games in the jungles of India's northeastern state of Mizoram. Nearly 100 US infantry soldiers were trained in unconventional battle tactics during the exercises organised by the Mizoram-based Counter Insurgency Jungle Warfare School at Vairengte. More than 50,000 people have been killed in the insurgency in the northeastern region since India's independence in 1947. Assam, meanwhile, has seen more than 10,000 people killed since the early 1980s in a series of uprisings against the Indian authorities.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Chirac flies to Asia with eyes on China's booming economy by Marc Burleigh (ADDS details).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President Jacques Chirac was to embark on an eight-day Asian tour Tuesday aimed at winning France a bigger slice of China's super-hot economic pie by playing on political and cultural relations that have grown noticeably closer. Chirac and 50 corporate chiefs were to fly out of Paris for a first, brief stop in Singapore, where they were to be greeted by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Writing in the Straits Times, the city-state's major English language daily, Chirac said he wanted to emphasise to Lee France's commitment to maintaining more than 30 years of warm bilateral ties. "It is only natural for me to come and meet him in order to show France's determination in continuing our relations with Singapore, which are based on friendship, trust and partnership," Chirac wrote. The French delegation will then move on to Vietnam where Chirac will make a two-day state visit before attending an Asia-EU summit in Hanoi on Friday. On Saturday, Chirac begins the main reason for the trip: a four-day state visit to China during which he and the delegation will try to convince officials that France can be "the partner of reference" in many areas -- but particularly business-wise. At stake is a piece of China's 1.4-trillion-dollar economy, which is continuing to expand at around nine percent this year. France currently ranks as China's fourth-biggest trading partner in the European Union and it wants to climb up the scale. Bilateral exchanges stand at 13.4 billion dollars yet French companies hold only 1.2 percent of the Asian giant's vast emerging market. French investment last year totalled 7.4 billion dollars compared to 10 billion dollars from Germany. By chasing deals in sectors such as nuclear energy, transport and aviation, Chirac -- a noted Sinophile with a passion for Chinese art -- hopes to see France gain privileged status. In that, he is helped by the shared vision of the two permanent UN Security Council members of a multi-polar world skipping out of the shadow of the dominant United States, and of a mutual appreciation of each other's culture, which is the subject of a two-year programme of exchanges started in 2003. Chirac's courtship could be seen in January this year, when Chinese President Hu Jintao visited France and the Eiffel Tower was lit red in his honour. Last week, a Chinese foreign ministry official, Shen Guofang, highlighted agreement "on many points to do with international and regional issues." He added: "During the presidential visit, we are going to study all means of cooperating more effectively, notably at the level of companies and their chiefs." The touchy subject of China's human rights record has been overshadowed by France's mercantile strategy, but Chirac's aides said the president would raise the subject "as he always does. politely and discreetly."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Poland will soon fix the date for withdrawal of its 2,500 troops from Iraq, Defence Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski said Tuesday, a day after announcing that the force should be pulled out by the end of 2005. "There is an ongoing debate within the government. Some preliminary conclusions will be presented by the prime minister to the parliament on October 15, when there is a vote on a no-confidence motion in the government," he told the private radio Zet. "We would like shortly afterwards to adopt a clear position and fix the withdrawal date," the minister added. Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said Monday after talks in Paris that no firm date to complete the withdrawal had been decided yet, but that Poland hoped "to finish our mission at the end of 2005." Poland is the fourth largest troop contributor to the US-led coalition in Iraq and one of Washington's staunchest allies there, but there is strong popular opposition at home to the deployment. Kwasniewski's remarks after talks with French President Jacques Chirac followed confusion in Warsaw, where the defence minister announced the troop withdrawal, only to be contradicted by other top government figures.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ALMATY, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Kazakhstan said Tuesday it was pushing ahead with efforts to buy a stake owned by gas group BG in the "super-giant" Kashagan offshore oil field even though several Western oil majors have interests in the reserves. This former Soviet republic announced earlier this year that it hoped to buy the 16.67-percent interest owned by BG (formerly British Gas) in the seven-member ENI-led consortium working at Kashagan. "There's understanding in relation to this question -- we've begun constructively looking at various compromise possibilities that should satisfy both sides, in particularly Kazakhstan," Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Vladimir Shkolnik was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying on Tuesday. Kashagan, in the Caspian Sea, is reportedly the world's fourth-largest oil field. It is estimated to contain 45 billion barrels (5.8 billion tonnes) of oil, of which between eight billion barrels and 13 billion barrels are currently considered recoverable. Ownership is currently divided between ENI, BG, TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil and Shell -- with 16.67 percent each -- as well as ConocoPhillips and Inpex with smaller stakes. The precise effect of Kazakhstan's ownership ambitions remains unclear. But relations between the Kazakh state and the consortium are known to have been rocky. "We have to be sure and they have to be confident that they can support the project as an investment partner," Shell's Managing Director Malcom Brinded recently told Western reporters. People familiar with the matter have said that other consortium members had wanted to divide BG's stake among themselves in order to ease the currently cumbersome decision-making process. Earlier this year Kazakhstan said that the consortium had agreed to pay a 150-million-dollar (125-million-euro) fine for delaying the start of production at Kashagan from 2005 until 2007 or 2008. The consortium is set to invest about 20 billion dollars in Kashagan over its first 20 years.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Romania and Bulgaria will be ready to join the EU on schedule in 2007, according to a European Commission report on their progress cited Tuesday by a diplomatic source here. They "will be able to fulfill all the criteria" for joining the union on January 1, 2007 and the accession treaty is likely to be signed early in 2005, the source said. Romania and its Balkan neighbour Bulgaria, which dragged their feet in implementing reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989, were left out of the wave of EU enlargement which brought 10 countries into the EU on May 1. The Commission, due to publish its latest annual reports on EU candidate states on Wednesday, will say that Romania now has a market economy able to withstand the competitive pressures inside the bloc, according to the diplomatic source. Bulgaria was last year deemed to have a functioning market economy, a requirement for joining the EU. Bulgaria closed its EU accession negotiations in June, but Romania has still to complete some areas of its entry dossier, notably in environmental, competition and legal fields. It is aiming to close the chapters by the end of this year.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Finnish labour market reform vital to pay for ageing population - OECD.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[HELSINKI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) called on Finland in a report on Tuesday to reform its labor market to boost employment, necessary to cope with an ageing population. Unemployment in Finland, particularly among the young and low-skilled, has since a recession in the mid-1990s been stubbornly high and at nine percent currently nearly twice as much as in the neighboring Scandinavian countries. When the government took office last year, it promised to cut unemployment in half and create 100,000 new jobs by the end of its term in 2007. Even government ministers now acknowledge that this was over-optimistic. "Wide-ranging and deep reforms are needed to cope with the implications of ageing, while preserving the basic principles of the welfare state," the OECD pointed out. "Reaching the government's medium-term employment rate target, for instance, would offset up to four-fifths of the future impact of ageing on living standards," the Paris-based body noted in a country report on Finland. Finland's goal of reaching a 75-percent employment rate, from below 68 percent currently, can be realized only through a more comprehensive package of labour market reforms, it added. The government should make Finns start to work longer by curtailing early retirement schemes, slash benefits for the long-term unemployed and cut taxes on labour and salaries, especially for high-income earners. It should also make them start working earlier through lowering the average age of enrolment and completion of university studies, as well trim the length of the basic higher education degree from five to three years, OECD said. Tuition fees and loans should also replace the free university and state support for students in order to cut back on the time spent completing degrees. Economic growth needs to be spurred through increased competition and labour market flexibility, with priority on reducing state ownership, support for agriculture and reforming the utilities, transport and retail sectors, it said. While telling the Nordic country to reform, the OECD also praised its ability to generate economic growth. "Finland has recovered more quickly from the global downturn than most euro area countries, and higher growth is likely to persist through 2005," it noted. The expansion in the Nordic country's gross domestic product averaged two percent in 2002 and 2003, and is expected to increase to 2.5 percent this year and four percent in 2005, OECD concluded.]]></c>

Net profit jumped 53.9 percent to 28.35 billion yen (260 million dollars) from a year earlier, when the company posted a then record 18.42 billion yen for the six months period. "We have achieved all-time highs in all profit lines and revenue, led by the brisk performance of our shopping mall unit, as well as the US and Asian units," Aeon president Motoya Okada told reporters. Aeon posted recurring profit of 69.18 billion yen, up 34.5 percent on revenue of 2.06 trillion yen, up 29 percent. Okada pointed to a strong profit contribution from Mycal Group, which Aeon acquired last year, and from MaxValue Tokai, which was previously known as Yaohan International, which it consolidated in the year to February. For the full year to February 2005, Aeon has left its forecasts unchanged, projecting net profit of 66 billion yen and recurring profit of 160 billion yen on revenue of 4.10 trillion yen.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GHAZNI, Afghanistan, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Interim President Hamid Karzai risked a rare trip outside Kabul Tuesday as he and his main rival stepped up their campaigns just days ahead of Afghanistan's violence-plagued elections. Karzai, whose first attempt to campaign beyond the capital was aborted after a rocket attack on his helicopter last month, flew in a fleet of choppers escorted by fighter jets to Ghazni, about 100 kilometres (63 miles) south of the capital. A crowd of around 10,000 people roared a welcome as he arrived at a public park amid tight security, with American bodyguards beefed up by truckloads of soldiers on the streets, roads blocked and heavy searches of everyone entering the gardens. The crowd, carrying posters with Karzai's picture and banners reading "Karzai is the symbol of unity", chanted Allahu Akbar (God is great) and "Long live Karzai", against a background of traditional drumming. At one stage Karzai stepped down from the podium to shake hands with the crowd, which included hundreds of women, but was swiftly urged back by his bodyguards. He told the audience, which local officials said numbered 50,000: "When I see this number of people, in their thousands, I'm delighted and I'm sure that I will win." Karzai said he was happy to see pictures of other candidates as well his own while on the way to the meeting, adding: "I urge you, whoever among the candidates gets elected you should support him. "I want your free votes. If someone comes with money or if a government official puts pressure on you to vote for me you should remember that this is going to be a free and secret ballot. You should not vote under pressure. "Your vote does not only elect your president but it lays the foundation of a peaceful, stable, prosperous Afghanistan." Karzai outlined his vision of a new Afghanistan, saying change had already begun. "Today's Afghanistan is not yesterday's Afghanistan. Today the rule of the gun has been limited and people can elect their president by their own will." He said he hoped a future Afghanistan would stand on its own feet, run on its own money, train its own army and police, build its own roads and have a good health service with water and electricity for all. "The income per capita in Afghanistan today is around 200 dollars and I hope that by the end of five years it will go up to 500," he said. Afghanistan should become a country "in which every man and woman shall take decisions about the future." In Kabul, the man considered to be Karzai's only serious challenger, former education minister Yunus Qanooni addressed a rally at a football stadium -- used as an execution ground by the former hardline Islamic Taliban regime. Some 2,000 supporters carried posters with Qanooni's picture and banners reading "Vote for Qanooni and establish peace". Qanoo and a French-speaking poet.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WELLINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[New Zealand's government ordered schools on Tuesday to ensure children take extra physical education in a bid to fight growing obesity. Education Minister Trevor Mallard announced that the nation's children would have to undertake one extra hour of physical activity every week on top of what they already do as part of their school's curriculum. Mallard said he had been concerned to see physical activity among young New Zealand children falling and obesity on the rise. He was proposing a change in education regulations so that schools treated physical activity as a priority. As a result of the changes he said each child would take part in "at least one hour of meaningful and high quality physical activity a week". Both state and private schools have physical education on their curriculum, although it ranges from very little activity in some schools to intensive programmes in others. The move was prompted by research showing 31 percent of New Zealand children are either overweight or obese and that more and more are leading sedentary lives -- 13 percent of five-to 17-year-olds in 2001 compared with eight percent in 1997.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Singapore Airlines (SIA) said Tuesday it will sell its 6.3 percent stake in Air New Zealand, officially ending a costly, failed foray into the Australasian market. SIA said it would place its 37,833,309 ordinary shares in Air New Zealand with investors to raise about 70 million New Zealand dollars (46.6 million US). "The decision by SIA to sell its Air NZ shares is consistent with its strategy to monetize non-core holdings," SIA said in a statement. "(The sale) will not impact on various areas of co-operation between the two airlines which will continue into the future." Air New Zealand, which last traded at 1.68 New Zealand dollars on Monday, was suspended on the New Zealand and Australian stock exhanges until Wednesday morning to faciliate the tender. SIA initially took a 25 percent stake in Air New Zealand four years ago but lost hundreds of millions of dollars after the New Zealand government was forced to bail out the troubled carrier and take majority ownership in 2001. SIA's stake was diluted to 6.3 percent in the recapitalisation exercise, leaving its ambitions to break into the Australian and New Zealand markets in tatters. SIA's initial interest was sparked by Air New Zealand's stake in Australia's second major carrier, Ansett Airlines, which has since gional rival. "The angle that somehow SIA is going to tie up with Qantas is highly speculative. I know that rumour has been out in the market but I'm not of that view. It's the proverbial 'sleeping with the enemy'," he said. Sanda pointed out that SIA and Qantas were in rival airline partnership groups, with the Singaporean carrier in Star Alliance and the Australian airline with One World. Ballantyne agreed it was unlikely the two carriers would agree to a formal partnership, with SIA currently more focused on China and India. SIA shares were unchanged at 11.00 Singapore dollars (6.50 US) in late afternoon trading on Tuesday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KABUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Afghan security forces killed seven suspected Taliban militants during a two-hour gunbattle in the southeast in the latest violence ahead of landmark polls, an official said Tuesday. The suspected Taliban fighters were killed Monday after ambushing a battalion of government troops some 40 kilometers (24 miles) east of Tirin Kot, the capital of troubled Uruzgan province. "Seven Taliban were killed during the fighting which lasted for two hours," provincial administrative chief Fazil Rabi told AFP by phone. The fighting erupted after more than 100 Taliban rebels attacked troops with small arms and machine guns in Khas Uruzgan, an insurgency-hit district in the east of the province. "More than 100 Taliban attacked our troops. We killed seven of them," Rabi said. The troops pursued the rebels in the mountains throughout the night. "Our troops are still there and we hope to kill or capture more Taliban that we believe are hiding in the mountains." Uruzgan, some 360 kilometers (223 miles) southwest of Kabul, is a hotbed of insurgency by loyalists of the Taliban regime which was ousted by a US-led military campaign in 2001. US forces did not take part in the battles, however several US military helicopters followed overhead to support Afghan soldiers on the ground, Rabi said. In a separate battle Sunday US-led soldiers captured 16 insurgents after a day-long firefight near the southeast border town Spin Boldak. Six of the insurgents were injured in the fighting, but the US-led coalition said in a statement there were no injuries among its forces. More than 18,000 US-led troops are in Afghanistan, hunting down Taliban militants and their Al-Qaeda allies across southern and eastern provinces. The Taliban, who have vowed repeatedly to disrupt October 9 presidential elections, have been attacking troops, electoral workers and officials. Twelve electoral workers are among hundreds of people killed in Taliban-related attacks this year.]]></c>

Simpson, 35, was among 38 skydivers from 16 countries taking part in an exhibition of base jumping to celebrate China's week-long National Day holiday. He was hurt early this morning in a practice jump before the afternoon event, which proceeded without incident. No further details were available. Base jumping, or parachuting from buildings, bridges and cliffs, is considered more dangerous than conventional skydiving and is banned in most countries. At least 81 people have died since 1981, according to an unofficial fatality list. Base is an acronym for building, antenna, span and earth. Jumping from the Jin Mao, divers had a scant eight seconds of free fall time before having to deploy their parachutes, with most touching ground a mere 30 seconds later. This was the second year the event was held in Shanghai.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGALORE, India, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[India and Australia go into Wednesday's first Test here without their first-choice teams amid growing concern about both the inclement weather and how the wicket will play. The Indians confirmed on Tuesday that star batsman Sachin Tendulkar will miss the match but indicated he was likely to be fit for the second Test starting in Madras on October 14. Australia, seeking to win their first series on Indian soil in 35 years, are not only without injured captain Ricky Ponting but also bereft of a second spinner to support Shane Warne after ignoring Stuart MacGill for the tour. Seasonal rain over the last week and a forecast of more showers for the next few days has only added to the uncertainty in both camps at the start of the highly-anticipated series. "Its terribly disappointing that Sachin won't be around," said Indian captain Sourav Ganguly. "The good news, though, is that he will fire in Madras. Thats the best one can look forward to." Ganguly hoped the four-match series will not be as close the previous one between the two teams on Indian soil in 2001 when the hosts won 2-1 in the last session of the third and final Test in Madras. "That one went down to the wire, I hope this one does not," he said. "A close contest takes a lot out of both teams." Both India and Australia will name their playing elevens on Wednesday morning, but Ganguly did not rule out including a third spinner in Murali Kartik to complement Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. "I have never seen such a dry wicket in Bangalore," said Ganguly. "It is bound to turn but a lot will depend on how the weather behaves." Australia, whose coach John Buchanan described the wicket as "terrible" on Monday, will lean heavily on Warne to deliver and the champion leg-spinner was ready for the task. "I don't feel as if I have something to prove," said Warne. "I have been inconsistent here, I've had some absolute shockers, but it doesn't mean I can't bowl. "The conditions here are so hot that sometimes you can't execute what you want, but this is the first time I have come to this country fit and raring to go." Warne, who needs six wickets to overhaul Muttiah Muralitharan's world record of 532, will be supported by a three-pronged pace attack of Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz. Left-hander Simon Katich will be pushed up the order to take Ponting's pivotal number three position, while Michael Clarke makes his Test debut to strengthen the middle order. Australia, who have not won a series in India since 1969, have lost five of their last seven Tests here. India have been beaten just once in their last 21 home series, by Hansie Cronje's South Africa in 2000. Likely teams: Australia: Adam Gilchrist (capt), Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Simon Katich, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Clarke, Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath. India: Sourav Ganguly (capt), Akash Chopra, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Venkatsai Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Parthiv Patel, Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Britain's Howard seeks to give flagging Conservatives a boost by Andrew Gully.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BOURNEMOUTH, England, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Britain's Conservative opposition leader Michael Howard was set Tuesday to give a vital conference speech in a bid to boost his party's election credentials after a battering in opinion polls. With a general election expected as early as May, Howard knows he has little time to turn around the flagging fortunes of a party which last week came an embarrassing fourth in a by-election won by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour party. According to excerpts of his speech released in advance, Howard will pledge in the English resort of Bournemouth that if elected, his party will provide tough governance and "only promise what we can deliver". Despite Blair having endured a difficult conference of his own party last week, dominated by differences over Iraq, recent polls have been grim reading for Howard and the Conservatives. An overwhelming 78 percent of respondants to a BBC poll Monday believe Howard will never become prime minister, while only 12 percent said he would be elected prime minister in the upcoming election. Moreover, in a sign of the challenge to the former flagship right-wing party, only 22 percent of those polled believe the Conservatives are the most effective opposition force to Labour, compared to 42 percent for the Liberal Democrats. If these trends turn into votes in May, it could deliver a stunning humiliation to the venerable party of former prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, which governed for 18 continuous years from 1979 until Blair took power in 1997. The poll was published just five days after the Conservatives came fourth in a by-election won by Labour in the northeastern English city of Hartlepool, slipping behind not only the Liberal Democrats, but also the United Kingdom Independence Party. UKIP, a relatively new force in British politics focussed on pulling Britain out of the European Union, is thought to be taking sapping eurosceptic support from the Conservative party. Howard's speech Tuesday will however be boosted by the news that one of UKIP's main financial backers, businessman Paul Sykes, appears to have changed back his allegiance to the Conservatives. "Better policies seem to be coming out of the Conservative Party than I have heard in many, many years," Sykes told BBC radio ahead of Howard's speech. "It looks like they're waking up to the fact that it is not a bad idea to make our own laws in our own parliament by our own people, rather than importing them from unelected Brussels," he said. Conservative party co-chairman Lord Saatchi was upbeat about his party's hopes despite recent polls, saying that Labour did not stand a chance with Blair at the helm. "If Tony Blair is still the prime minister, I can't see any way in which Labour can win the general election," he told the BBC radio. There was hope, too, amongst those awaiting the conference speech in Bournemouth. "In 1992, we expected to lose, and we won. In 1997, we thought it would be tight and we have lost hands down," delegate Queenie Comfort told AFP.]]></c>

The plant could be built in countries where labour costs were relatively low, such as Brazil, Australia or Russia. A final decision would be made during the next few months, said the head of the steel division of German heavy industry giant ThyssenKrupp, Ulrich Middelmann. Seperately, Middelmann said that ThyssenKrupp Stahl expected to double its pre-tax profits for the business year just ended.

		<c><![CDATA[The former US governor of Iraq has admitted the United States "never" had enough ground troops in Iraq to establish firm control of the country, directly contradicting assertions by President George W. Bush and top Pentagon officials that the US military had what it needed to win the war. The admission, made in a speech Monday, was certain to add fuel to already heated exchanges between President George W. Bush and his Democratic rival, John Kerry, who has repeatedly accused th president of failing to adequately plan for post-war Iraq. "We never had enough troops on the ground," Ambassador Paul Bremer told a conference of insurance professionals in White Sulphur Springs, Wesnistration officials, who have insisted the United States had enough forces in Iraq. About 133,000 US troops are currently deployed in Iraq, forming the bulk of an international coalition that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein, according to top defense officials. Other coalition forces have a total of 23,500 soldiers in the country. The US failure to find alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction notwithstanding, Bremer said he agreed with Bush's decision to use force in Iraq because there was a "real possibility" Saddam Hussein might have provided these weapons to terrorist groups that had vowed to kill Americans. "The status quo was simply untenable," he insisted. "I am more than ever convinced that regime change was the right thing to do." He dismissed charges that the administration had no plans for post-war Iraq, but acknowledged that many of these plans were inadequate. "There was planning, but planning for a situation that didnt arise," he said, m were "some things that worked very well and some things that don't work quite so well" in Iraq.]]></c>

The accords -- an extradition treaty and another on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters -- were signed by Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh and his south Korean counterpart Ban Ki-Moon. The extradition pact "would work as a deterrent for criminals and help reduce criminal activities with international ramifications", an Indian government statement said. Roh, on a three-day visit to India, and premier Singh had earlier met for private talks before being joined by their delegations. Roh, who arrived in New Delhi on Monday, began his engagements with a ceremonial welcome Tuesday at the presidential palace attended by President Abdul Kalam, premier Singh and his cabinet colleagues. Speaking to reporters after the welcome ceremony, Roh said he was "deeply impressed with (India's) deep blue skies" and the "beautiful scenery filled with green". The large number of Koreans in India were "full of hope and expectations about (India's economic) future," he said. South Korea is the fifth biggest investor in India after the United States, Mauritius, Britain and Japan, according to official da It was, Roh said, "necessary to positively weigh the benefits of a Korean-Indian Free Trade Area (FTA) in order to provide institutional back-up for bilateral economic exchanges."

		<d><![CDATA[JAKARTA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An emotional Megawati Sukarnoputri on Tuesday urged Indonesia to accept the results of landmark polls which delivered a landslide victory to her former security minister, clearing his path to the presidency. In a speech to mark Indonesia's armed forces day she came the closest yet to conceding defeat since official results released Monday declared Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono the landslide victor of the September 20 elections. "All sides should be able to accept (this) well, uphold the values of democracy and mutually respect each other," Megawati said. "We have to be able to show the world that our nation is a big nation and one of noble ethics," she said, visibly choking back tears. Yudhoyono, who will be sworn in as Indonesia's first democratically elected president on October 20, has struggle to push through new legislation in a parliament where his political party is in minority. On Monday Yudhoyono sketched his blueprint for a new cabinet, promising it would be dominated by professionals who he would personally scrutinise for "capacity, integrity and dedication". Jakarta's markets reached new highs on Monday amid speculation of better economic times ahead, although gains were curbed on Tuesday amid profit taking. Financial monitors Fitch Ratings agency said it had raised the outlook on Indonesia's sovereign ratings to "positive" from "stable" to reflect diminished uncertainty following the election result and an improved outlook for reforms. Monday's official result drew a line under a marathon election year for Indonesia, with two rounds of presidential voting and legislative polls in April, which Megawati hailed as a "major achievement for our nation". Indonesia's emergence as the world's third largest democracy comes just six years after former president Suharto was forced to stand down, ending three decades of authoritarian rule. Congratulations, led by US President George W. Bush, have already arrived for Yudhoyono, the preferred candidate among the international community which sees him as tough on Indonesia's growing problem of militant violence. Indonesia has suffered three major terrorist strikes in two years under Megawati. Those attacks and others have been blamed on the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah regional terror group. Some 202 people died in the October 2002 Bali bombings, a car bomb strike on Jakarta's Marriott hotel in August 2003 left 12 dead, and nine were killed last month in an attack on Australia's Jakarta embassy.]]></c>

With Australia's Iraq deployment a contentious issue in the October 9 election, opposition defence spokesman Kim Beazley said his Labor Party would not extend its Christmas deadline even if asked by the Iraqi government.

His comments came after Foreign Minister Alexander Downer released a letter from Iraqi deputy prime minister Barham Salih thanking Australia for its part in the US-led campaign and asking for an ongoing commitment.

		<c><![CDATA[The winner of the 2004 Nobel Literature Prize will be announced on Thursday at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT), the Swedish Academy announced on Tuesday. Among the usual suspects whose names have surfaced year after year are US novelist Philip Roth, Albania's Ismael Kadare, Czech author Milan Kundera, Syrian-Lebanese poet Adonis and Swedish poet Tomas Transtroemer. But speculation has been rife in Stockholm this year that women writers, long overlooked by the Swedish Academy which each year awards the Nobel Literature Prize, could be well-placed to take home the honours this time. Only nine women have won the prize since it was first handed out in 1901. Most recently, it went to Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska in 1996. Observers have thus cited Algeria's Assia Djebar, Joyce Carol Oates of the United States and Dane, Inger Christensen as potential winners. Last year, it went to J.M. Coetzee of South Africa. The Nobel Literature Prize is the only Nobel Prize whose announcement date is revealed only two days in advance, and the prizewinner's name is traditionally made public on a Thursday. The Literature Prize will be the fourth of the 2004 Nobel Prizes to be awarded, following those for Medicine, Physics and Chemistry. It will be followed by the Peace Prize on Friday, and the Economics Prize next Monday, October 11. Each Nobel Prize this year will carry a prize sum of 10 million Swedish kronor (1.3 million dollars, 1.1 million euros), to be shared if the prize is awarded to more than one laureate.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Pakistani security forces have agreed to a 10-day ceasefire with Al-Qaeda-linked fighters to allow their tribal allies to try to negotiate a peaceful solution, a local administrator said Tuesday. "The request for a ceasefire by the Mahsud tribe in South Waziristan area has been accepted to give the political process a chance," local administration chief Ismatullah Gandapur told AFP. "The security forces will retaliate only if they are attacked." The Mahsud tribe of ethnic Pashtuns dominates South Waziristan's troubled towns of Kanigarram, Sarvakai, Makin and Laddah, where skirmishes have erupted daily following bloody clashes between troops and militants in recent months. The ceasefire, which came into effect late Monday, was negotiated by a 19-member mediating team of tribal elders and religious scholars from the deeply conservative region, Gandapur said. Mediators will urge tribesmen to hand over or expel foreign Al-Qaeda militants hiding in their area or compel them to register with the local authorities with a firm pledge to lay down their weapons, the official said. Hundreds of Al-Qaeda and Taliban fugitives poured into the region from Afghanistan in late 2001 when a US-led military offensive toppled the Taliban regime, which had sheltered Osama bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda fighters. Officials suspect some 600 to 700 mainly Uzbek and Chechen fighters are hiding in the tribal belt along the Afghan border. Gandapur said an estimated 150 to 200 of them were believed hiding in the Mahsud tribe's region, surrounded by thick forests and high mountains. Pakistani forces have conducted a series of military operations in the tribal region to plug cross-border attacks by Taliban insurgents who have vowed to disrupt October 9 polls in Afghanistan. The military says it has killed around 150 foreign militants in the region over the past 12 months and destroyed several Al-Qaeda hideouts and training camps.]]></c>

Sri Lanka bundled Pakistan out for a meager 122 and scored a seven-wicket victory in a group match which paved their way to win the Asia Cup back on home soil in July. The Sri Lankans also won the Asian Test title in 2002. "Asia Cup is finished and this is a new tournament at a new venue but it was nice to win a major event like the Asia Cup," Atapattu told reporters Tuesday. "We need to build on that win by achieving good results here." The tri-series event also involves a new look Zimbabwe side who have lost both their matches against Pakistan. "There are two major sides in this tri-series and we need to beat them to qualify for the final and that's what our aim is," said Atapattu, whose side will miss the guile of wily off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. "Of course, we miss Muralitharan but in the last few months we have shown good all round performances from the available players." Muralitharan, who holds the world record of most Test wickets with 532 besides 366 one-day wickets in 237 matches, is recuperating after a shoulder injury and is not on this tour. Atapattu said his four-pronged pace attack gives his side some edge. "We have four pacers with the return of Dilhara Fernando so that gives us more options and we are right up there to expose any weakness Pakistan has," he said.

		<d><![CDATA[WARSAW, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Poland will soon set a date for the withdrawal of its 2,500 troops from Iraq, Defence Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski said Tuesday ahead of tense talks with US Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. Szmajdzinski, who announced the day before that the Polish contingent should be pulled out by the end of 2005, said that a final timetable would be decided soon after a vote of no confidence in the government on October 15. "There is an ongoing debate within the government. Some preliminary conclusions will be presented by the prime minister to the parliament on October 15, when there is a vote on a no-confidence motion in the government," he told the private radio Zet. "We would like shortly afterwards to adopt a clear position and fix the withdrawal date," the minister added. Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said Monday after talks in Paris that no firm date to complete the withdrawal had been decided yet, but confirmed that Poland hoped "to finish our mission at the end of 2005." Poland is the four last year in the wake of the US-led invasion and heads up a multinational division of 6,000 soldiers in south-central Iraq. But the intervention has proven costly. Seventeen Polish nationals have died in Iraq -- 13 soldiers and four civilians -- including three soldiers killed in an attack last month near the central Iraqi city of Hilla. According to the latest poll, more than 70 percent of Poles are opposed to the presence of their country's troops in Iraq.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[ANKARA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Turkey is on the verge of clearing a major hurdle on the way to the European Union, but a largely favorable EU Commission report due out Wednesday is neither the last, nor the hardest obstacle Ankara will face before achieving full membership, Turkish newspapers agreed Tuesday. "Turkey gets its ticket for Europe, but strict controls at the frontier," headlined the popular daily Aksam, referring to the conditions attached to the green light the report is expected to give on Wednesday. "Thank God, there are no more obstacles to starting the (membership) talks," wrote a columnist in another popular newspaper, Sabah. "The negotiations can last 10, 15 years -- who cares. Turkey will at last be a member of the European family." The much-awaited report is widely expected to recommend that EU leaders give Turkey a date to start accession talks with Turkey when they meet at a summit on December 17 -- a milestone in this country's four decade long wait to join the European club. "It will not be an easy process," warned a columnist in the liberal daily Milliyet. "Turkey will need strong political will and major preparations" to go through the long and difficult negotiating process. The main recommendation of the report, according to leaked documents, says: "Turkey sufficiently fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria to begin membership negotiations." But this comes with a caveat that the process could be suspended "if the Commission believes that the conduct of reforms in Turkey is compromised." The editorialist for the mass circulation Hurriyet wrote that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan should be congratulated for having brought Turkey this far on the road to the EU, particularly because "the religious tenets that form his personality and the reforms he has achieved are totally contradictory." The moderate leftist Radikal headlined, "Turkey on Europe's agenda", and one of its columnists wrote: "Turkey's road to Europe is now open. And, as always, the result will depend on how well we perform." Tongue in cheek, a columnist for the popular Posta wrote: "Once our toilet training is done. we will be perfect Europeans." Explaining that Turkey would have to change from hole-in-the ground toilets to western-style sit-down jobs, he said: "Keep your eye on changes in our toilet culture -- it is the most important indicator. Things will happen faster than we think."]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices rallied back above 50 dollars a barrel on Tuesday, closing in on record high points on technical factors and persistent worries about tight global supplies, traders said. The price of light sweet crude for November delivery climbed 35 cents to 50.26 dollars a barrel in pre-opening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil prices hit all-time peaks of 50.47 dollars in New York a week ago. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November rose 51 cents to 46.70 dollars in early deals. "It is all technical-led at the moment," GNI-Man Financial trader Kevin Blemkin said. "There was some technical buying in London, which pushed the market higher," added Investec Securities analyst Bruce Evers. "Prices broke through technical levels, triggering more buying." The oil price in New York had slipped below 50 dollars a barrel Monday as rival gangs in the oil-rich Niger Delta signed a ceasefire. Two rebel groups fighting for control of oil resources in the Niger Delta region signed a government-brokered ceasefire and disarmament agreement late on Friday after months of violence. Despite the easing of tensions in Nigeria, markets remained concerned about tight supplies ahead of winter in the northern hemisphere.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[SKorea demands end to controversy over its nuclear tests (UPDATES with North Korea's accusation).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[South Korea on Tuesday called for an early end to controversy over its secret nuclear experiments, saying it was hindering efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons drive. Unification Minister Chung Dong-Young expressed the wish in a meeting with Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Chung's office said. ElBaradei is in Seoul to attend an anti-nuclear weapons forum while his inspectors are investigating Seoul's unauthorized experiments to produce plutonium and enriched uranium -- essential ingredients for atomic bombs. South Korea insists the lab experiments were purely for scientific purposes, not linked to nuclear weapons programs, but IAEA inspectors last month visited the country twice and are expected to visit again soon. ElBaradei has expressed "serious concern" about South Korea's nuclear activities. The Vienna-based UN watchdog will hold a meeting of its board of directors in November to determine whether the matter ought to be referred to the UN Security Council. "We hope the case will be closed at the IAEA meeting of directors in November and will not be referred to the UN Security Council," Chung told the IAEA chief, his office said. Chung warned that a further delay in resolving the case would affect talks to end the two-year impasse over North Korea's nuclear ambitions. "It's up to the meeting but we will do our utmost to avoid (having the case being referred to the UN)," ElBaradei was quoted as saying. The UN watchdog wants South Korea to come clean about its past unauthorized nuclear experiments and not to repeat its mistake. The case has embarrassed the United States and South Korea when they are trying, through six-party talks, to pressure Stalinist North Korea to end its nuclear weapons drive. North Korea refused to take part in a fourth round of the multilateral talks, scheduled for last month, blaming what it called hostile US policy and the secret nuclear experiments. "The nuclear activities of South Korea have reached such a level where it can possess elements necessary for waging a nuclear war such as extraction of nuclear substances, manufacture of nuclear bombs and production of means for nuclear delivery," Minju Joson, the North's government newspaper, said in a commentary Tuesday. The newspaper accused South Korea of trying to develop nuclear weapons, pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula "to an extreme phase" and adversely affecting relations. "If it goes nuclear, Koreans will suffer a horrible nuclear calamity and the whole land of Korea will be reduced to ashes," the paper said. South Korea said its scientists produced 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of uranium metal in 1982 in undeclared activities and a small amount of that was used in 2000 to produce a microscopic amount of enriched uranium. The scientists also admitted to having extracted a miniscule amount of plutonium from 2.5 kilograms of fuel rods in secret research in 1982. South Korea has the world's sixth-largest civilian nuclear industry, operating 19 power plants that produce 40 percent of the country's energy needs.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[An Australian skydiver was seriously injured Tuesday when he "base jumped" off China's tallest building in a practice run before a government sponsored exhibition of the stunt. Roland Simpson jumped from the 420.5-metre (1,387-foot) Jin Mao Tower and was "seriously" injured when he failed to "land properly", the official Xinhua news agency reported. Staff at the nearby Dongfang Hospital said an exhibition participant had been injured but refused to give more details. Simpson, 35, was among 38 skydivers from 16 countries taking part in an exhibition of base jumping to celebrate China's week-long National Day holiday. He was hurt this morning in a practice jump before the afternoon event, which proceeded without incident. A website, www.basejump.org, said that Simpson, also known as Slim, had encountered line twists in his chute, landing on a roof adjacent to the marked landing area and was unconscious. According to the site, Simpson, who had been wearing a "wing suit" to give him more maneuverability in the air, was a highly experienced jumper, having logged more than 1200 jumps. No further details were available. Base jumping, or parachuting from buildings, bridges and cliffs, is considered more dangerous than conventional skydiving and is banned in most countries. At least 81 people have died since 1981, according to an unofficial fatality list. Base is an acronym for building, antenna, span and earth. Jumping from the Jin Mao, divers had a scant eight seconds of free fall time before having to deploy their parachutes, with most touching ground a mere 30 seconds later. This was the second year the event was held in Shanghai.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Singapore's former prime minister Goh Chok Tong will head his government's efforts to resolve disputes with neighbouring Malaysia, the two governments announced Tuesday in a further sign of rapidly improving relations after decades of bickering. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, visiting Malaysia as part of a swing through Southeast Asian neighbours after taking over in August, and his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi agreed on the new role for Goh, who is known for a genial, consensus-driven style. Lee and Abdullah made the announcement after meeting in Malaysia's administrative centre Putrajaya. They agreed to take further steps to promote cooperation, including joint business activities in emerging markets like China, Indonesia, India and Bangladesh. The two leaders also witnessed the signing of a new agreement on the avoidance of double taxation to promote trade, investment, financial activities and the movement of technical experts across their borders. They are both among each other's top trade and investment partners. Bilateral trade in 2003 totalled 46 billion US dollars, according to Singapore figures. "We regard this as an important event in our bilateral relations," Abdullah, 64, told journalists in a joint appearance with Lee after their meeting. "We must continue to seek new areas of cooperation and this would be in the interest of Malaysia and Singapore. We can have joint ventures in third countries or undertake projects together," Abdullah said. Lee, 52, said "the tone of relations has improved in the last 12-18 months," adding that "we need to build on this and develop more momentum of cooperation between our two countries." "We can cooperate in tourism. Our private sector can work together. We can cooperate in security matters, anti-terrorism and security in the Malacca Strait," he said. Lee also cited joint efforts to combat the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic last year and the current bird flu problem in Southeast Asia. Goh, 63, stepped down as prime minister in August after 14 years in power in favour of his deputy Lee, son of Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, 81. The elder Lee led the city-state out of the Malaysian federation in 1965 amid a dispute over racial policies. Ties have often been stormy since the separation but improved quickly after Abdullah took over from Malaysia's feisty veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad, 78, in October last year. Aides told AFP that Goh and Abdullah have warm personal relations. Goh took the title Senior Minister -- number two in Singapore's political hierarchy -- after stepping down and is also chairman of the central bank. "We have already invited Senior Minister Goh to visit Malaysia. I believe he will be able to make at least one visit by end of the year," Abdullah told journalists. Lee said he told Abdullah that "although I have taken over as prime minister, I have asked Mr. Goh Chok Tong to look after the bilateral issues because he is familiar with them," adding that the issues were 'complex" with "many ins and outs." Disputes persist over the price of long-term water supplies to Singapore, Singapore's military access to Malaysian airspace, the future of Malaysian-owned railway land inside Singapore, and a proposed new bridge linking the two nations.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Philippine and Australian defense officials opened a two-day meeting here Tuesday on defense cooperation covering such issues as counterterrorism and maritime security. The first meeting of the Philippine-Australia Defense Cooperation Working Group comes despite Australia's bitter criticism of the Philippines' pullout of its troops from Iraq in July, in compliance with the demands of Iraqi militants holding a Filipino truck driver hostage. The meeting at the military headquarters in a Manila suburb, will take up the strategic dialogue between the two countries, efforts to reform the poorly-equipped Philippine military and cooperation on maritime security and counter-terrorism, a statement from Manila said. The Philippine side is represented by assistant secretaries of the two countries' defense departments, Alejandro Melchor of the Philippines and Ben Coleman of Australia. Australia has been a close defense ally of the Philippines and has been highly concerned about the presence of members of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) terror network in the southern Philippines. Security officials say JI members are being sheltered in the south by local Muslim separatist guerrillas who are negotiating peace with the government. However President Gloria Arroyo has said the local rebels have cut their ties to the JI as part of the peace process with Manila. The JI, considered the Southeast Asian chapter of the Al-Qaeda terror network, has been blamed for the 2002 Bali bombings and the bombing of Australia's Jakarta embassy last month.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Spain's government is to set next February 20 as the date for a popular referendum on a European Union constitution, the foreign ministry announced Tuesday. The date is in line with plans by Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to make Spain the first of the 25 member-states to adopt the constitution. A broad consensus had been achieved on the date during a Monday meeting between Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos and members of the Spanish upper and lower houses of parliament, a foreign ministry statement said. Consensus was also achieved on the question to be put to the public, which would be: "Do you approve the draft treaty establishing a constitution for Europe." The foreign ministry statement confirmed a report appearing in the newspaper El Pais. The government will set forth its position formally on October 18 before a mixed commission on Europe comprising members of the congress and senate, the statement said. The next step will be for cabinet to adopt plans to give notice of the referendum. Under Spanish law notice must be given between 30 and 120 days before the actual vote, diplomatic sources said. The referendum will be only consultative, they said. A new constitution would have to be ratified by parliament. Parliamentary approval appears assured since the major parties all favour the new constitution. Zapatero recently expressed the hope that a massive yes-vote would show his country was in the front rank of building Europe, and had "returned to the heart of Europe."]]></c>

The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index fell 3.51 points at 861.56. Volume was 441 million shares worth 949 million ringgit (250 million dollars). Losers led gainers 369 to 335, with 296 stocks unchanged and 321 untraded. Dealers said that even though Malaysia is an oil exporting country, oil prices will likely to have a negative impact on domestic consumer confidence. "Oil prices will affect consumer confidence in the coming months. The key sectors to be affected are semiconductors, primarily because of a slowdown in external demand, and transport with higher costs of fuel," an analyst with a regional brokerage said. Among blue chips, Tenaga Nasional was down 0.10 at 11.20 ringgit, while Telekom Malaysia was up 0.10 at 11.60 and Maybank fell 0.10 to 11. Malaysia International Shipping Corp was up 0.10 ringgit at 13.0 following a report that the shipping company has received bids from international ship owners for its fleet of 30 bulk carriers estimated at between 2.85 billion ringgit and 3.42 billion ringgit.]]></c>

Lee said he told Abdullah that "although I have taken over as prime minister, I have asked Mr. Goh Chok Tong to look after the bilateral issues because he is familiar with them," adding that the issues were 'complex" with "many ins and outs." Disputes persist over the price of long-term water supplies to Singapore, Singapore's military access to Malaysian airspace, the future of Malaysian-owned railway land inside Singapore, and a proposed new bridge linking the two nations.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Singapore Airlines (SIA) sold its 6.3 percent stake in Air New Zealand for 61.7 million New Zealand dollars (41.1 million US) on Tuesday, officially ending a costly, failed foray into the Australasian market. SIA sold its 37,833,309 ordinary shares in Air New Zealand for 1.63 New Zealand dollars each, three percent cheaper than Monday's closing price on the New Zealand stock exchange of 1.68 dollars, the carrier said in a statement. "The decision by SIA to sell its Air NZ shares is consistent with its strategy to monetize non-core holdings," SIA said in a separate statement released earlier Tuesday to announce its intention to divest. "(The sale) will not impact on various areas of co-operation between the two airlines which will continue into the future." SIA initially took a 25 percent stake in Air New Zealand four years ago but lost hundreds of millions of dollars after the New Zealand government was forced to bail out the troubled carrier and take majority ownership in 2001. SIA's stake was diluted to 6.3 percent in the recapitalisation exercise, leaving its ambitions to break into the Australian and New Zealand markets in tatters. SIA's initial interest was sparked by Air New Zealand's stake in Australia's second major carrier, Ansett Airlines, which has since folded. The Australian-based chief correspondent of regional trade magazine Orient Aviation, Tom Ballantyne, described SIA's investment in Air New Zealand as a "disaster" and said the Singapore carrier had long given up on getting a substantial return. Qantas were in rival airline partnership groups, with the Singaporean carrier in Star Alliance and the Australian airline with One World. Ballantyne agreed it was unlikely the two carriers would agree to a formal partnership, with SIA currently more focused on China and India. An SIA spokesman would not comment on the airline's future plans, saying the only details to be given out on Tuesday were in the statements. SIA shares closed 10 Singapore cents (5.9 US cents) lower at 10.90 Singapore dollars on the Singapore stock exchange on Tuesday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAYONNE, France, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two ground-to-air missiles used in shoulder launchers have been found in arms caches in southwest France uncovered in weekend raids against suspected members of Spain's armed Basque separatist group ETA, French officials said Tuesday. One missile was discovered along with a large amount of explosive material in a house under construction in the town of Urrugne, near the Spanish border, the official said on condition of anonymity. A police source said the other was discovered hidden in the village of Briscous, 30 kilometres (20 miles) away. Seventeen people, including Mikel "Antza" Albizu Iriarte, ETA's political leader and chief theoretician, and his girlfriend, Soledad "Anboto" Iparragirre Genetxea, a suspected former military chief of the group, were arrested in the region Sunday in swoops by French anti-terrorist officers. Spanish officials said they arrested another four suspects on their side of the border the same day. Three of the suspects arrested in France were released Monday and the 14 others remain in custody, the French official said, adding that searches of the arms caches were continuing and would "take several days". The officials said experts were examining the missiles to determine where they were made and how they might have been acquired by ETA. According to the Spanish Basque-region newspaper El Diario Vasco, quoting documents found in previous raids, the separatist group is believed to have several SAM-7 missiles able to blast low-flying aircraft out of the sky. ETA has been waging a bloody campaign for an independent homeland in parts of northern Spain and southwestern France since 1959. It has been blamed for the deaths of 817 people in that time, according to a toll published Monday by Spain's El Pais daily. Both Spain and France hailed Sunday's raids against the group as a "historic" victory.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Concerned by a loss of momentum after his debate with John Kerry, US President George W. Bush has abruptly scheduled a major speech for Wednesday in hopes of halting the erosion of his lead in the polls, The Washington Times reported Tuesday. In a rare, last-minute change in the presidential schedule, Bush has scrapped a planned talk on medical liability and instead will give what the White House called a "significant speech" about the two central issues of the campaign -- the war on terrorism and the economy, the newspaper said. The president is said to be eager to rebut Kerry's attacks on such issues, especially those that came during last Thursday's presidential debate, according to The Times. "There has been an attempt by the president's opponent to launch false attacks and mislead the American people on these big priorities," the paper quotes White House press secretary Scott McClellan as saying. "There are some big differences facing the American people, and the president wants to highlight those differences."]]></c>

They said investors are now waiting to see the new cabinet to be announced by President-elect Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who has promised that he will have more professionals than political party representatives in his government. He is due to take office on October 20. The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index closed up 4.869 points at 861.318 on volume of 3.03 billion shares worth 1.9 trillion rupiah (207 million dollars). Declines led advances 63 to 60, with 96 stocks unchanged. The rupiah was at 9,085-9,095 to the dollar compared to Monday's level of 9,097-9,107. Dicky Wirawan, head of research of PT Dongsuh Kolibindo, said he sees further upside in the coming sessions. "Bargain-hunting will continue while investors wait for the new cabinet," he said, adding that despite the recent strong run the market still looks as though further gains are possible. State telecom firm Telkom gained 50 rupiah at 4,400 while long distance operator Indosat dropped 25 at 4,425. Carmaker Astra International gained 200 rupiah at 7,650.

		<d><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US scientists David J Gross, H David Politzer and Frank Wilczek on Tuesday won the 2004 Nobel Physics Prize for pioneering work in explaining quarks, nature's tiniest building blocks, the Nobel jury said. "The discovery which is awarded this year's Nobel Prize is of decisive importance for our understanding of how the theory of one of nature's fundamental forces works, the force that ties together the smallest pieces of matter -- the quarks," the jury said. By an elegant mathematical formula, the laureates have enabled science to finally dream about finding explanations for some of nature's greatest enigmas in cosmos, such as the dark matter that seems to dominate space. "The laureates have made it possible to complete the Standard Model of Particle Physics, the model that describes the smallest objects in nature and how they interact," the jury added. Their work is an important step in scientists' attempts to provide a unified description of all forces of nature -- "a theory for everything". Their major discovery concerns the so-called strong force, or "colour force", which is dominant in the atomic nucleus. The laureates will receive a gold medal and share a cheque for 10 million Swedish kronor (1.1 million euros, 1.3 million dollars) at the formal prize ceremony held, as tradition dictates, on December 10, the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize's creator Alfred Nobel. On Monday, the Nobel Medicine Prize went to US research duo Richard Axel and Linda Buck for their pioneering work on mammals' sense of smell. The Chemistry Prize will be announced on Wednesday, the Literature Prize on Thursday and the Peace Prize on Friday. This year's edition of the coveted prizes rounds off with the announcement of the Economics Prize on October 11.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Eastman Kodak, the US film technology firm, said Tuesday it would axe 870 job cuts across Britain and France as part of a global cull blamed on the increasing popularity of digital photography. A facility in Harrow, west London, that sensitizes photographic film for the graphics industry will close by the end of March 2005, affecting about 250 employees, the group said in a statement. Another plant in Annesley, central England, producing consumer photographic film will be shut by September 2005, with the loss of about 350 jobs. A further 270 positions will be shed at a site in Chalon, eastern France. The cuts are part of a three-year programme announced by Kodak in January to reduce its global workforce by up to 15,000. "Such actions are essential for Kodak to reinforce its leading position in digital imaging products and services, while sustaining and extending its worldwide leadership in traditional photographic products," said Etienne Bourgeois, regional operations manager for Europe, Africa and the Middle East.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Indonesian police said Tuesday a senior officer has been removed as head of a police anti-terror task force after he took a convicted Bali bomber on an outing to Starbucks. Brigadier General Gorries Mere, the head of a police anti-terror task force that played a major role in bringing Bali bombers to justice, was "reassigned" and replaced by his deputy, national detective Suyitno Landung said. But Mere, who also heads a national anti-narcotics unit, would be kept as a "consultant" to the task force. "I don't see anything unusual with this reassignment. This is a routine internal decision," Landung told AFP. Journalists in September spotted Bali bomber Ali Imron, who is serving a life sentence, enjoying coffee with Mere at a Jakarta Starbucks outlet. Imron, who admits involvement in the October 2002 attacks that killed 202 people, was transferred to Jakarta in May to help efforts to catch two fugitive Malaysian bomb experts involved in the Bali blast and other recent explosions. Among the few who expressed remorse for the bombing, he has cooperated extensively with police, providing details of the entire pre-attack operation mounted by the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[When John Kerry wound up his closing statement in last week's presidential debate he intoned "God Bless America." George W. Bush signed off with, "May God continue to bless our great land. For trivia buffs, it was the first time in the 44-year history of such debates that both candidates went out invoking the deity. But for political analysts it was emblematic of something far more consequential. Indeed, rarely has a White House election been imbued with such religious fervor as this year, with a quietly surging evangelical Christian movement and a born-again president pressing a modern revival. "We are seeing this year a rather extraordinary emphasis on church-based politicking from both parties," said Robert Boston, assistant communications director for Americans United for Separation of Church and State. To those who see the United States as the land of Hollywood glitz and the Big Mac, it may come as a revelation the country ranks among the most pious nations on the planet. More than 60 percent of Americans say religion is very important to their lives and a third attend services at least once a week. Seven in 10 feel it is important for their president to have strong religious beliefs. More pertinently for the November 2 showdown between the Republican Bush and his Democratic challenger Kerry, the degree of fervor appearss religious polarization, with his unabashed references to divine inspiration and black-and-white view of the world. He has taken strong moral positions on issues such as abortion and proposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages. Bush created a special White House office to help promote funding for faith-based social services. Critics argue he has gone beyond his agenda of "compassionate conservatism" and blurred the United States' tradtional separation of church and state. They also say Bush's religious zeal is mixed with political calculation. For the Christian right represents about 50 million to 60 million voters, half or more of the 105 million Americans who cast ballots in 2000. If the movement has kept a low profile organizationally, 70 percent still back the president. "It is no exaggeration at all to say that Bush can win only with the votes of evangelical Christians," said Peter Singer, a Princeton University professor attached to its Center foentrated in key swing states such as Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsyvlania.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Big-thinking US churchs wield mounting power by Catherine Hours.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LINDENWOLD, New Jersey, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Bethany Baptist Church thinks so big that when Sunday service is held there are traffic jams on nearly every road leading to it. Bishop David Evans, does not have to worry about feeding the 5,000. He has a congregation of 20,000 faithful at his church. The church, in the New Jersey town of Lindenwold, is a larger than life building in smalltown America. The huge white windowless structure is one of more than 850 mega-churchs whose numbers have tripled across the United States over the past decade. The biggest is at Lakewood in Houston, Texas -- the home state of President George W. Bush, -- with 25,000 members. And the growing religious fervour in the United States has not been lost on Bush, a born-again Methodist, or his Democratic rival John Kerry as they step up the battle for the November 2 election. Bush in particular sees fertile ground among American evangelists and baptists. Mega-churchs now play pivotal roles in local communities. Their success is a testament to a sign of religion's strength and some slick marketing. John Vaughan, a specialist on religion, told how the leaders of 30 different denominations held a special meeting in Chicago in 1990 to find ways to revive their institutions, "to reach and aggressively go to the unchurch people." He said: "Big churches have a mission. They are able to reach different kinds of people and communities: the poor, the rich, African Americans, Asians, Whites. "They have more space, they have a multiple staff of 100 to 200 people. A big church can saturate a whole city. In Jackson, Florida, they trained people to go to every home. "They can send out tens of thousands of volunteers every year, all over the world, who are willing to give their own money," according to Vaughan. Bethany calls itself "the church that never sleeps". People can come to pray anytime of any day. "People are coming back to God," said Evans, a 52-year-old former banker, who started preaching to a handful of followers in 1990 and now runs a 13 million dollar site which was finished in 2000. There are 70 staff and hundreds of volunteers helping Evans, the main pastor and teacher as well as Prelate of the Abundant Harvest Fellowship of Churches, which says it has churchs in Africa and India. At Bethany, and other mega-churchs, the recipe is basically the same: a charismatic preacher who mixes evangelical fervour with religious spectacle. The outside cultural and social activities make the congregation ever closer. At Bethany, there are services, but also dance and theatre courses, "Makeover Day" with stylists, barbecue days, support for th the ecstatic congregation. "I was very broken in my life when I came. The service is very healing," said Pamela Drayton, a prison visitor. "It's not the old traditional church, it's fun, there is always stuff going on, the songs are upbeat." The church is almost full but the pastor has discovered other ways to spread the word. He appears on radio and brings out DVDs. Evans is interested in politics. He says is conservative about gay marriages and abortion and sometimes liberal about women's rights, including women priests. But he insists "this is not a social activism church. Evangelism is the core of what we do." "We are fishers of men, we bring people to a knowledge of Jesus Christ." The church's work targets all areas of the population. Last Saturday, the church showed "Bibleman" a masked hero for children who combats evil by reading the texts against a background of flashing lights and rock music. At the end, Bibleman called on the children to repeat:l shift in voter trend can translate into a substantial number of ballots, which could be crucial in battleground states like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which have large concentrations of Jewish residents. And the battle for those ballots is well and truly on. "The torrent of daily mail targetting Jewish voters from both Republican and Democratic party activists is astonishing," said David Harris, executive director of the non-partisan and non-denominational American Jewish Committee. "It's fast, it's furious and it's unrelenting," Harris said. President George W. Bush is hoping that his steadfast backing for Israel will help win over swing Jewish voters. But Harris said he would have his work cut out to improve on the 20 percent support he won in the 2000 election. While the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a priority, American Jews are quintessential multi-issue voters, who tend to lean leftwards on social topics like abortion, gay rights and the environment. Once it has been established that neither presidential candidate is likely to water down the US-Israel relationship, those other socio-economic issues enter the equation and tilt it towards Democrat challenger John Kerry. The Kerry camp has been careful to learn the lesson handed down in 1980 to Democrat Jimmy Carter, whose perceived shift in favour of the Palestinians resulted in an unprecedented 40 percent of the Jewish vote going to Republican Ronald Reagan. Kerry has been careful not to be outflanked on the Israel issue, telling the Anti-Defamation League that he would never force Israel to make concessions that compromise its security. "The security of Israel is paramount," Kerry said. Nevertheless, Republicans believe Bush's record on Israel, as well as his leadership in the war on terror could win over enough voters to make a difference. "The fact that Jews turn out rain or shine and are concentrated in states with many electoral votes, magnifies the ael and more small 'c' conservative in terms of domestic issues." In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Diament believes the US Jewish community became firm supporters of the war on terror, especially those with family links in Israel. "That feeling would have worked in Bush's favour, but the waters were muddied by the war in Iraq, with a lot of Jews, along with a lot of other Americans, questioning whether the invasion was really necessary," he said. The ACJ survey found that 66 percent of American Jews disapprove of Bush's handling of the war with Iraq, while 52 percent disapprove of the government's handling of the overall war on terror.]]></c>

"This illegal trade is the greatest threat to endangered species next to the loss of their habitat," said John Sellar, the senior enforcement officer for CITES. "Organized crime is undoubtedly involved in wildlife crime," he said, noting that established trafficking routes were used to take wildlife from Asia to one of the world's largest markets, Europe. He said the Russian mafia was responsible for smuggling caviar worth tens of millions of dollars in recent years. Other experts said organised crime gangs may be responsible for much of the trade in and out of Hong Kong and China. However, the complicity of civil servants, including forest guards, customs officials and high-level politicians was also contributing to the crisis.

The Straits Times Index closed down 2.15 points at 2,011.74, while the broader All Singapore Equities index dipped 1.18 points to 523.82. Volume was 649 million shares worth 597 million Singapore dollars (355 million US), down from 757 million shares worth 830 million dollars on Monday. Losers led gainers 170 to 150, while 460 stocks were unchanged. "Profit taking after yesterday's rally was to expected. At current levels, investors will probably take every opportunity to book gains," said a dealer at a local brokerage. Dealers said sentiment also took a hit from persistently high crude oil prices, with the New York futures contract for November delivery remaining above 50 US dollars a barrel on Monday. Among blue chips, Singapore Airlines closed down 10 cents at 10.90 Singapore dollars after selling its 6.3 percent stake in Air New Zealand although analysts said the divestment was the right move. "Overall, we view this development as positive as it frees up cash for the company," Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. research analyst Rohan Suppiah said. Other blue chips closed mostly lower, with Singapore Telecommunications down two cents at 2.39, Singapore Press Holdings down four cents at 4.74 and ST Engineering unchanged at 2.13.

		<d><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The US Senate has signaled its determination to make public the nation's intelligence budget, breaking with the past practice of keeping billions of dollars of government spending under wraps. By a vote of 55-37, senators Monday shot down an amendment by Republican Ted Stevens of Alaska that would have required the government to continue keeping secret how much is spent on intelligence gathering. A provision calling the publication of such information is contained in a sweeping intelligence reorganization bill sponsored by Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Joseph Lieberman which calls for the creation of a powerful intelligence czar who would have control over all 15 US intelligence agencies. The bill, inspired by the commission that probed the September 11 attacks, also calls for a better exchange of information between the agencies and the creation of a national counterterrorism center. Estimates of the US intelligence budget have often circulated in the media but have never been officially confirmed by government officials. This year's intelligence budget is believed to have reached a record 40 billion dollars. The disclosure provision calls for making public only the overall size of the intelligence budget, without itemizing it. Stevens expressed concern that disclosure could facilitate leaks of sensitive information and hinder US spy operations around the world. "If we are not careful, we'll destroy the intelligence system we are trying to reorganize," he said. This kind of transparency, Stevens continued, could result in the United States having even fewer intelligence sources overseas than it has now. But Lieberman countered by saying the intelligence community was spending public money and needed to account for it. "The bill under debate in the Senate gives me great hope that we are on a path to get this right," said the Connecticut Democrat.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[The eurozone economy is likely to maintain its first half growth pace in the second half of the year, but the economic recovery remains timid, the European Commission said Tuesday. Euro zone GDP grew by 0.5 percent in the second quarter and 0.6 percent in the first quarter, said the EU executive's quarterly report on the 12-nation group which shares Europe's single currency. "The economy has actually expanded slightly faster than expected during the first half of the year, with growth accelerating towards potential, and should continue to expand at a similar pace throughout the rest of the year," it said. But EU monetary affairs commissioner Joaquin Almunia said there were no grounds for complacency. "The recovery still looks relatively timid," he said in the introduction to the report. Almunia said the contribution to euro zone growth from exports will gradually diminish, so an acceleration in growth will depend on an upturn in domestic demand, which remains elusive. "Some positive signs not withstanding, domestic demand has, so far, failed to gather sustained momentum because of weaknesses in household consumption and continued sluggishness in investment," the Commission said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Zambia, 40 years on, debates a first home-grown constitution by Dickson Jere.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LUSAKA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Forty years after winning independence from British rule, Zambia is still struggling to shed its colonial legacy with a new constitution decided by its people. Zambians are getting ready to celebrate four decades of freedom from colonial rule on October 24 but the failure to craft a fundamental charter to replace the British-imposed constitution is putting a damper over the festive mood. "We need a Zambian-grown constitution without any foreign ingredients," says opposition leader Dean Mung'omba of the Zambia Alliance for Progress (ZAP). "This would be the best way of celebrating our 40th independence anniversary," he said. Zambia at independence inherited a constitution from its colonial rulers that set up a unitary state, outlawed local customary law in favor of British common law and made English the official language. The constitution has been amended three times but these changes were done to suit the president in office, fuelling political instability in the poor southern African country. "Four constitutions for Zambia in a period of 40 years is undoubtedly too many," said John Mwanakatwe, a freedom fighter and one of the country's pioneer lawyers. "Let us hope that the next constitution will be more durable than previous constitutions," Mwanakatwe said. The fourth version, which is being written by a Constitutional Review Commission, is expected to be ready by the end of 2004, but President Levy Mwanawasa said it would not be enacted until after the 2006 general elections. Mwanawasa said last month that holding a referendum on the constitution and general elections within a period of two years will be too costly for Zambia, which recently put off local elections due to lack of funds. But Zambians from a cross-section of society have been demanding that the new constitution should be passed this year or early next year to underpin 40 years of independence. "Life begins at 40. This is why we feel this constitution should come into effect immediately and deal with the new phenomenon of neo-colonialism," said Humphrey Mwewa of the Civil Society for Poverty Reduction. The majority of Zambia's 10 million people live below the poverty line and a new fundamental charter is seen as key to lifting Zambians out of hardship. At issue in the current debate is the powers of the presidency, the independence of the judiciary and whether Zambia should adopt a federal system comprised of nine states. There are also calls for proclaiming at least one or even all of the seven main languages as official languages in Zambia. Founding president Kenneth Kaunda changed the constitution twice, first in 1972 to introduce a one-party system of government and again in 1991 to undo his first amendment and bring back multi-party rule. Kaunda argued that one-party rule would help spur development but he came up against massive public pressure and was ultimately forced to abandon the move. His successor Frederick Chiluba changed the constitution in 1996 by introducing a clause that barred Zambians with foreign parentage from standing for the presidency. This change was seen as aimed at Kaunda, whose parents came from Malawi, and wanted to challenge Chiluba in the 1996 polls.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US scientists David J. Gross, H. David Politzer and Frank Wilczek on Tuesday won the 2004 Nobel Physics Prize for pioneering work in explaining quarks, nature's tiniest building blocks, the Nobel jury said. "The discovery which is awarded this year's Nobel Prize is of decisive importance for our understanding of how the theory of one of nature's fundamental forces works, the force that ties together the smallest pieces of matter -- the quarks," the jury said. By an elegant mathematical formula, the laureates have enabled science to finally dream about finding explanations for some of nature's greatest enigmas in cosmos, such as the dark matter that seems to dominate space. Their work is an important step in scientists' attempts to provide a unified description of all forces of nature -- "a theory for everything". Science's current best shot at such a theory is the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which describes the smallest objects in nature and how they interact. Quarks build the protons and neutrons of the atomic nucleus, atoms join up to form molecules, the molecules build up structures, "and in this way the whole universe can finally be described." The trio's specific discovery, made three decades ago, concerns the so-called strong force, or "colour force", which is dominant in the atomic nucleus. The Nobel jury acknowledged that the relevance of their discovery for daily life can appear hard to grasp. But using the example of a coin spinning on a table, it said that 80 percent of the coin's weight is due to the interaction between quarks. "This year's Nobel Prize is about this interaction," it said. The laureates will receive a gold medal and share a cheque for 10 million Swedish kronor (1.1 million euros, 1.3 million dollars) at the formal prize ceremony held, as tradition dictates, on December 10, the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize's creator Alfred Nobel. On Monday, the Nobel Medicine Prize went to US research duo Richard Axel and Linda Buck for their pioneering work on mammals' sense of smell. The Chemistry Prize will be announced on Wednesday, the Literature Prize on Thursday and the Peace Prize on Friday. This year's edition of the coveted prizes rounds off with the announcement of the Economics Prize on October 11.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Arsenal's new 60,000-seater ground at Ashburton Grove which is scheduled to open for the 2006-07 season will be known as the Emirates Stadium for the next 15 years after they agreed a 100 million pound deal with Emirates Airlines. The company will also be the Gunners' shirt sponsor for eight years starting in the 2006-07 Premiership season when the English champions start life at their new 400 million pound ground. The Gunners have been at their Highbury ground, which now has a capacity of only 38,500, since 1913. The agreement was signed Tuesday at Highbury by Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood and Maurice Flanagan, Emirates vice-chairman and group president. Keith Edelman, managing director of Arsenal, said: "The sheer size and scale of this deal is an amazing opportunity for Arsenal. We are delighted to have Emirates as our partner and sponsor." Emirates are currently shirt sponsors of Arsenal's London rivals Chelsea, but that deal expires at the end of the current season. Emirates Airlines chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum hopes the tie-up will boost the popularity of the sport in the United Arab Emirates still further. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sponsor such a major new stadium and club, and represents a win-win partnership for both Emirates and Arsenal," Sheikh Ahmed said. Emirates also sponsor match referees at Premiership and Football League level through an agreement with the Professional Game Match Official Limited (PGMOL) which runs until 2007.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGALORE, India, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Star batsman Sachin Tendulkar said Tuesday he will be fit to play for India in the second Test against Australia in Madras from October 14. The 31-year-old was ruled out of Wednesday's first Test here because of the tennis elbow injury that has kept him out of the game for seven weeks. Tendulkar missed three one-day tournaments in August and September, but was included in the 15-man India squad for the first Test to enable him to seek treatment from team physiotherapist Andrew Leipus. "I have been doing some strengthening exercises for my left arm," Tendulkar said. "Ive been asked not to rush and do things gradually. I will resume nets once I get the all-clear from Leipus. "I am of course much better and should be fit for the second Test." Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said the star batsman would be missed at Bangalore for both his batting and leg-spin bowling. "Its terribly disappointing that Sachin won't be around," said Ganguly. "We will definitely miss him. He's a great player and contributes not just with the bat but also with his bowling. "The good news, though, is that he will fire in Madras. That's the best one can look forward to." Tendulkar, who underwent intensive treatment both in England and India to be fit in time for the highly-anticipated series, said last week he was unable to pick up a bat due to the pain. He has scored 9,470 runs in 114 Tests at an average of 57.39 and is just one behind Sunil Gavaskar's world record of 34 centuries. Australia, aiming to win their first series on Indian soil since 1969, will play the third Test in Nagpur (October 26-31) and fourth in Bombay (November 3-7).]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Thai ace Tamarine Tanasugarn took another step towards working her way back into the top 20 by eliminating third seed Shinobu Asagoe in the women's first round at the Japan Open tennis tournament on Tuesday. Unseeded Tamarine, who has plunged down the rankings to 85th in the world after being 19th two years ago, looked strong in a 6-0, 6-4 win over the Japanese home favourite. Tamarine blamed her slide down the rankings this year on poor performances in major tournaments, particularly the US Open. "Probably after the US Open it affected me a lot," Tamarine said. "Last year I got into fourth round and this year I lost too early, so it dropped a bit. "I don't really do very good performance this year, except Wimbledon. This is going to be my second last tournament this year, so I'm just gonna try to be back in top 50 again and prepare for next season." Tamarine played almost immaculately in the first set using accurate and angled strokes to outfox Asagoe, a US Open quarter-finalist. Asagoe, the world number 42, charged to the net and broke in the second for 2-0 and in the sixth for 3-3 in the second set, but that was the limit of her challenge as she became the highest seed to fall. "She (Asagoe) did so well in the US Open and I feel like it's so hard for her to play at home, because there are so much expectations," said Tamarine, who has never lost a singlbledon champion Maria Sharapova of Russia and France's Tatiana Golovin, as well as the men's 16 seeded players led by Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, received first-round byes.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[WHO urges speedier vaccine development to fight bird flu.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[GENEVA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The World Health Organisation (WHO) Tuesday called for work on developing a vaccine against bird flu to be speeded up after Thailand confirmed that a young girl was the country's 11th victim of the virus this year. "A vaccine could reduce the high morbidity and mortality normally associated with influenza pandemics, if available sufficiently early," said a statement from WHO hgeadquarters in Geneva: "Significant efforts are needed to expedite vaccine development and thus take advantage of this preventive option." Public health agencies "need to engage in discussions with pharmaceutical companies to explore areas of common interest in vaccine development and identify areas where support is needed," it urged. It was reported in Bangkok Monday that an eight-year-old girl had died of bird flu in northern Thailand, the country's 11th confirmed victim of the virus this year. She was confirmed as having the lethal H5N1 form of the virus. At least 19 people have died of bird flu in Vietnam since December and millions of birds have died or been culled across Asia. The WHO stressed the importance of educating populations in affected countries, "especially those living in remote rural areas, about the danger of contact with diseased birds." It called on countries affected to provide samples to WHO-linked laboratories for tests. The WHO also complained that for economic reasons only two of 12 leading pharmaceutical companies producing anti-flu vaccines -- Aventis Pasteur and Chiron -- had undertaken research into a vaccine against bird flu. It urged that companies should produce small quantities of vaccines for the purpose of clinical tests. The WHO statement noted that tests were continuing on a previous case in Thailand announced last week which had caused fears of a mutation of the virus making it possible for it to be transmitted from human being to human being. It said heightened surveillance "has provided no evidence that efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission is presently occurring in Thailand." Thai officials last week confirmed the country's first probable case of human-to-human infection of bird flu following the deaths of a mother and daughter. The latest Thai victim had lived in a poorly ventilated one-storey house and helped pluck chickens after her grandmother and mother slaughtered the remaining birds for cooking, according to a Thai health ministry statement. Last month Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra criticised the health and agriculture ministries for not doing enough to stem the outbreaks, and said local authorities should have announced suspicious poultry deaths more quickly. Thailand last Friday launched a "war on bird flu" with more than 900,000 volunteers carrying out house-to-house checks for signs of the disease. Bird flu outbreaks have affected 35 of Thailand's 76 provinces from July to October 1.]]></c>

Dozens of small savers and shareholders of the more than 100,000 affected by the collapse attended the hearing in Milan, but the main accused, Calisto Tanzi, the 65-year-old former chairman and founder of Parmalat, was absent.

		<c><![CDATA[Three Taiwanese men have been arrested for alleged drug-trafficking in Thailand after being found with 20 kilogrammes of heroin, police said Tuesday. Kao Chih-ping, 35, Chiang Ching-huang, 47, and Chen Chien-hung, 42, said they had been hired to take the drugs to Taiwan where they had a street value of more than one million dollars, according to police. Police said they found a quarter of the haul Tuesday in the luggage of one of the men as he was checking in at Bangkok's international airport to fly back to Taiwan. The other two were arrested during a raid at their flat in Bangkok where the rest of the drugs were found. The arrests came just a few days into a new round of the "war on drugs" launched by Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin has promised "brutal" new measures against dealers to follow on from a 2003 crackdown which left more than 2,000 people dead. Thailand was criticised by governments, the UN and rights groups over the harsh tactics that peaked in early 2003, with claims of extrajudicial killings and arbitrary arrests, but the campaign had the overwhelming support of a public concerned over an epidemic of youth drug addiction.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BANGKOK, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Thai premier Thaksin Shinawatra will meet with his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi next week for talks aimed at solving violence in the kingdom's south, officials said Tuesday. The two leaders would meet on the Thai resort island of Phuket on October 14 where Thaksin would present the Malaysian prime minister with new information on attacks that have killed more than 315 people this year, said Thai government spokesman Jakrapob Penkair. "Talks will concentrate on solving problems in southern Thailand as prime minister Thaksin now has more details about trouble-makers and measures to quell the unrest," said Jakrapob. Thailand and Malaysia agreed to create a "smart card" in August in a joint effort to better monitor people holding dual nationality, which Thailand alleges allows Muslim militants to come and go as they please. Jakrapob said the Thai premier had also announced a shake-up of security forces in the country's trouble-hit south after Thailand's respected queen complained about a continuing separatist campaign. Thaksin appointed the deputy supreme commander of Thai forces to head a new security command structure reporting directly to him on the violence. Other bodies coordinating security work in the region have been abolished, said Jakrapob. Queen Sirikit, who last week completed a month-long tour of the south, met Thaksin last week where she expressed concerns about continuing unrest and called for government officials to work together. Thailand's deputy prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said Thaksin was also expected to re-shuffle his cabinet Wednesday, but did not indicate whether this would include changes affecting the south. The latest violence was sparked in January when an attack on an army base left four soldiers dead and hundreds of weapons looted. Attacks have continued on an almost daily basis, mainly targeting officials and security forces, in what Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said amounted to the biggest crisis of his premiership.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[British Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon Tuesday torched 21 tonnes of heroin, hashish, and opium at a ceremony in Islamabad as he praised Pakistan's efforts to tackle drugs. "This drug burning ceremony is an example in practice of the kind of cooperation we see over a number of years, so we are delighted with the efforts Pakistan is making," Hoon said on the first day of his two-day visit here. Pakistan, neighbouring the world's biggest opium and heroin producer Afghanistan, is a major transit point for narcotics smuggled out of the war-torn country to the streets of Europe and other overseas destinations. Hoon said Britain was the "lead nation" in anti-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan. "We work closely with our partners, particularly Pakistan along the border, but with also other partners inside Afghanistan to tackle this problem," he said. The head of Pakistan's Anti-Narcotics Force Major General Nadeem Ahmed said that for every 360 tonnes of heroin produced in Afghanistan, 260 tonnes reaches Europe and the United States. On average authorities in Pakistan seize 60 tonnes while some 40 tonnes is used domestically by drug addicts in Afghanistan. "We have a 2,500 kilometre (1,500 mile) long and porous border to guard with an inadequate strength of 1,500. extremely limited intelligence gathering capacity and a limited aerial mobility," Ahmed said. He said "the silver lining in this bleak scenario" was the international community's revival of the anti-narcotics fight as a priority which "somehow had got relegated in our war against terrorism." Ahmed said opium poppy farming had resumed in Pakistan, but anti-drug forces had slashed the Pakistani poppy growth rate by 18 percent between last year and this. Pakistan has between 3.5 million and four million drug addicts, Ahmed said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Voting operation "limited" for Iran's Afghan refugees (ADDS background).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[TEHRAN, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Organisers of voting in Afghanistan's landmark presidential elections by Afghan refugees living in Iran announced Tuesday they had completed their preparations, but acknowledged the scope of the operation would be limited. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM), charged with providing access to the ballot for Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, revealed it had only been working in Iran for just over two months -- far short of what experts say is the bare minimum time required. "I can say with confidence that we are ready for this historical event on Saturday," said Peter Erban, director of the IOM's out-of-country voting operation. "It is correct that the 78 days we had available is not sufficient to reach the kind of coverage we would like," Erban said, adding that the multi-million-dollar operation would be "limited" but "better than no vote at all". IOM did not elaborate on why it had been given such a short amount of time to prepare for the Afghan vote in Iran. Experts generally consider six months is needed for such operations. It also acknowledged that it would not provide voting facilities for the southeastern Iranian border region of Zabol in Sistan-Baluchestan province, which is home to most of the ethnic Pashtun Afghan refugees in Iran. Furthermore, access to ballot boxes in several refugee camps will not be provided. For voting operations in Pakistan and Iran, IOM has a budget of 21 million dollars. And while IOM declared it would be providing facilities to some 84 percent of Afghan refugees in Iran who could vote, the organisation also acknowledged that "we don't actually know the number of eligible voters". Estimates of the number of eligible Afghan voters in Iran range between 600,000 and 700,000. Voter registration has not taken place, with Afghan refugees being called upon to turn up to polling stations with their identity documents. Around one million accredited Afghan refugees are still living in the Islamic republic, according to the latest figures from the UN's refugee agency. For the vote count, ballot boxes from Iran will be flown to Kabul. IOM also declined to comment on reported fears among Afghan refugees -- mainly in Sistan-Baluchestan province -- that turning up to vote could expose them to detention and forced expulsion. Repatriations of Afghan refugees from Iran are supposed to be voluntary, but there have been reports of accredited refugees being deported along with illegal migrants. Interim President Hamid Karzai, who was elected by a council of tribal leaders in June 2002 after the Taliban regime was ousted in a 2001 US-led invasion and has American backing, is widely tipped to win the elections. Seventeen other candidates are standing for election, with former education minister Yunus Qanooni, a prominent anti-Taliban political figure, seen as Karzai's main competition. Among the other candidates are two former communists from the days of Soviet control in the 1980s, a couple of warlords, five with links to anti-Soviet Islamic fighters, one woman, and a French-speaking poet.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Poland to set date for withdrawal from Iraq soon: minister by Henry Meyer (RECASTS, ADDS PM quotes, comment).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[WARSAW, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Poland, one of the main pillars of the US-led coalition in Iraq, will soon fix a date for the withdrawal of its 2,500 troops, its defence minister said Tuesday, the day after he surprised Washington by promising a pullout by the end of 2005. Defence Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski, speaking before tense talks with visiting US Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, said that a final timetable for the withdrawal would be decided soon after October 15. "There is an ongoing dedivisions within the Polish government, with Prime Minister Marek Belka complaining that he had not been consulted over the defence minister's announcement Monday of a pullout by the end of 2005. In an interview with the daily Rzeczpospolita published on Tuesday, Belka insisted that Szmajdzinski's comments "do not reflect the position of the government." He is "very optimistic if he thinks that the situation in Iraq will stabilise sufficiently by the end of 2005 to enable us to withdraw our contingent," said Belka, who was the top economic official in the former US-led administration of Iraq. However, the two men met Tuesday and Szmajdzinski stressed that he had agreed his latest announcement with Belka. "The prime minister has authorised me to inform public opinion of this," he said. Analysts in Warsaw said that the ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) party was trying to salvage its popularity ahead of elections next year, with opinion polls currently crediting it with only seven percent support. "In the background there is the very weak position of the ruling party in Poland," Mateusz Falkowski of the Institute of Public Affairs think-tank told AFP. Another factor was the US election, in which Kerry now seems to have a fighting chance of success. "The Polish government is trying to moderate its position (over Iraq) among other reasons because there is a possibility that Kerry will become president of the United States," he said.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Chirac flies to Asia with eyes on China's booming economy.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[President Jacques Chirac embarked on an eight-day Asian tour Tuesday aimed at winning France a bigger slice of China's economic pie by playing on political and cultural relations that have grown noticeably closer. Chirac and 50 corporate chiefs flew out of Paris on a presidential jet for a first, brief stop in Singapore, where they were to be greeted by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong after arriving early Wednesday. In a letter to the Straits Times, the city-state's major English language daily, Chirac said he wanted to emphasise to Lee France's commitment to maintaining more than 30 years of warm bilateral ties. "It is only natural for me to come and meet him in order to show France's determination in continuing our relations with Singapore, which are based on friendship, trust and partnership," Chirac wrote. The French delegation will then move on to Vietnam where Chirac will make a two-day state visit before attending an Asia-EU summit in Hanoi on Friday. On Saturday, Chirac begins the main reason for the trip: a four-day state visit to China during which he and the delegation will try to convince officials that France can be "the partner of reference" in many areas -- but particularly business-wise. The visit will take in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Chengdu. It is Chirac's third trip to China since 1995. At stake is a piece of China's 1.4-trillion-dollar economy, which is continuing to expand at around nine percent this year. France currently ranks as China's fourth-biggest trading partner in the European Union and it wants to climb up the scale. Bilateral exchanges stand at 13.4 billion dollars yet French companies hold only 1.2 percent of the Asian giant's vast emerging market, and the trade deficit with China currently stands at around six billion dollars. French investment last year totalled 7.4 billion dollars compared to 10 billion dollars from Germany. By chasing deals in sectors such as nuclear energy, transport and aviation, Chirac -- a noted Sinophile with a passion for Chinese art -- hopes to see France gain privileged status. In that, he is helped by the shared vision of the two permanent UN Security Council members of a multi-polar world skipping out of the shadow of the dominant United States, and of a mutual appreciation of each other's culture, which is the subject of a two-year programme of exchanges started in 2003. Chirac's courtship could be seen in January this year, when Chinese President Hu Jintao visited France and the Eiffel Tower was lit red in his honour. Last week, a Chinese foreign ministry official, Shen Guofang, highlighted agreement "on many points to do with international and regional issues." He added: "During the presidential visit, we are going to study all means of cooperating more effectively, notably at the level of companies and their chiefs." The touchy subject of China's human rights record has been overshadowed by France's mercantile strategy, but Chirac's aides said the president would raise the subject "as he always does. politely and discreetly." Deals in the offing include a possible two-billion-euro (2.4-billion-dollar) purchase of Airbus aircraft by China Southern and Air China, and, longer-term, a sounding out of interest for 10 of Airbus's future 555-seat A380 superjumbos ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Eurocopter, a sister company of Airbus in the European Aeronautic Defence and Space (EADS) group, is looking to sign an agreement to jointly build six-tonne helicopters that would entail a 600-million-euro investment. EADS shares rose sharply Monday, by nearly five percent, on the expectations. French engineering group Alstom is also in the running for a 12-billion-euro project to provide high-speed trains between Beijing and Shanghai, while nuclear energy group Areva is looking ahead to tenders of three new nuclear power stations. French cereal farmers, meanwhile, are pushing Chirac's delegation to win export orders to China, after a 10-year absence from that market. Chirac is due back in Paris on October 13.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Oil prices rebound above 50 dollars, close in on record highs.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Oil prices rallied back above 50 dollars a barrel on Tuesday, closing in on record high points on technical factors and persistent worries about tight global supplies, traders said. The price of light sweet crude for November delivery climbed 43 cents to 50.34 dollars a barrel in pre-opening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices at one stage hit 50.40 dollars, nearing the all-time peak of 50.47 dollars reached in New York a week earlier. In London the price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in November rose 55 cents to 46.74 dollars in early deals, just short of the record summit of 46.80 dollars seen last week. "There was some technical buying in London, which pushed the market higher," Investec Securities analyst Bruce Evers said. The oil price in New York had slipped below 50 dollars a barrel Monday as rival gangs in the oil-rich Niger Delta signed a ceasefire. Two rebel groups fighting for control of oil resources in the Niger Delta region signed a government-brokered ceasefire and disarmament agreement late on Friday after months of violence. Despite the easing of tensions in Nigeria, markets remained concerned about tight supplies ahead of winter in the northern hemisphere. Traders were also nervous about ongoing disruption to oil supplies in the Gulf of Mexico. "There is still a lot of the Gulf of Mexico production out of action since the hurricane (Ivan)," Evers said. Almost 30 percent of the 1.7 million barrels of daily of production in the Gulf of Mexico remains disrupted by recent hurricanes, according to the US Minerals Management Service, a government agency. Close to 15 million barrels of output has so far been affected, equal to 2.45 percent of the Gulf of Mexico's annual oil production. Wednesday meanwhile sees the release of the latest weekly US crude inventory figures. "Prices are higher on concerns that tomorrow's US inventories stock data will come in lower," Prudential Bache broker Christopher Bellew said. US crude commercial inventories showed a surprise increase last week after tumbling to their lowest levels since February a fortnight ago. The Department of Energy said crude oil reserves rose 3.4 million barrels in the week to September 24 to 272.9 million barrels, a week after a spectacular drop of 9.1 million barrels due to Hurricane Ivan. But distillates -- mostly diesel and heating oil -- fell 1.3 million barrels to 125.5 million barrels. "The market is starting to focus on the inventory data, which is probably going to show a decline in heating oil and distillate stocks and only a very small increase in crude stocks," Evers said. "There is a risk that the data will show a tightening market."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Dollar marks time ahead of services data.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The dollar took a breather Tuesday ahead of a survey of activity in the US services sector, holding on to steep gains seen in the wake of the G7 weekend meeting. The single European currency stood at 1.2282 dollars in early European trading against 1.2283 late on Monday in New York. The dollar traded at 110.93 yen compared with 110.96 on Monday. The US currency steadied after rallying on Monday, notably against the euro, following a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven industrial powers in Washington which produced no surprises. Dealers were sitting tight awaiting fresh leads from a survey of activity in the US service sector from the Institute for Supply Management. US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was also due to address the American Bankers Association later Tuesday. "The dollar's recovery to mid-range is squeezing shorts (sold positions) and opens the way for further short-term gains should the employment component of today's ISM non-manufacturing index repeat the rises in the less significant manufacturing and Chicago purchasing managers' indices, raising the possibility of an above-forecast payroll number Friday," Commerzbank economists wrote in a note to clients. "While we continue to believe the unchanged G7 line on forex leaves the way open for a lower dollar over time, there is a reluctance to push the dollar outside current ranges while China retains its current peg," they added. There was little market reaction to eurozone data showing a drop in the purchasing managers' index for services to 53.3 points in September from 54.5 in August, and below forecasts for a reading of around 54.5. "Overall, a soft survey: weaker than expected growth environment and more subdued inflation picture," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, economist at CIBC World Markets. In Germany unemployment, adjusted for seasonal factors, rose by 27,000 to 4.445 million in September from August, Bundesbank figures showed. It was the ninth month in a row that the seasonally adjusted jobless total has risen. The euro was changing hands at 1.2282 dollars against 1.2283 late on Monday in New York, 136.25 yen (136.29), 0.6888 pounds (0.6889) and 1.5535 Swiss francs (1.5532). The dollar stood at 110.93 yen (110.96) and 1.2645 Swiss francs (1.2645). The pound was at 1.7833 dollars (1.7839), 197.80 yen (197.91) and 2.2552 Swiss francs (2.2550). On the London Bullion Market, the price of an ounce of gold stood at 414.25 dollars against 412.55 late on Monday.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[LYON, France, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[French authorities arrested an Algerian cleric for deportation Tuesday after a court ruled he can be thrown out of the country for publicly defending wife-beating. Police arrested Abdelkader Bouziane at his home in the eastern city of Lyon and took him to a special airport detention centre pending his deportation to Algeria, officials said. Bouziane's lawyer, Mahmoud Hebia, confirmed the arrest and said his client may be flown out of France within hours, on board a scheduled flight from Lyon to Algiers. The cleric's detention came the day after France's top administrative court overturned a previous ruling suspending an expulsion order against Bouziane that had been issued by the interior ministry. The action against Bouziane, 53, was prompted by an interview he gave the April issue of a local Lyon magazine in which hef. In June he was put under judicial investigation, one step short of formal charges, for "justification of a crime and direct provocation" as the interior ministry appealed the decision to France's top administrative court, the State Council. "The State Council has clearly stated the law. The ministry's order has had its legal validity restored. The imam (cleric) will thus be taken out of the country under deportation procedures," regional authorities in Lyon said in a statement. Hebia said his client had offered no opposition to police and that he had had time to pack his personal effects. He added that he would see the cleric later in the day, and reiterated that Bouziane denied the accusations that he links to terrorists.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Europe and Russia are increasingly coming to share the United States' skepticism about Iran, a US official said Tuesday, insisting that pressure must be maintained on the conservative Tehran regime. The official also lamented negative Iranian interference in Iraq, and reiterated Washington's belief that a number of Al-Qaeda leaders are in Iran, although Tehran's relationship with them is unclear. The US administration, which has cut ties with Iran and labels it part of a so-called "axis of evil", is pushing its global partners including the European Union to back its hardline stance, in particular over Tehran's alleged nuclear plans. In contrast the EU has long maintained a "carrot and stick" policy of active engagement with Iran, holding out the prize of trade concessions in return for progress on democratic and other reforms. But these have been called into question since February elections brought hardliners to power in Tehran. "My impression is that the Europeans and Russia have come to share many but not all of our doubts about where Iran is going," said the official, as a US delegation held talks on Iran with EU and Canadian officials in Brussels. The official, requesting anonymity, said Iranian assistance has been reaching certain elements in neighbouring Iraq, including notably firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr, since the end of last year's war. "They are doing a certain amount of harm in Iraq," he said, while conceding that it remains unclear whether the Tehran regime itself is behind the assistance. On Al-Qaeda, the official said Washington "is not linking Iran to Al-Qaeda," but underlined: "We know that certain elements of the Al-Qaeda leadership are in Iran." It is unclear whether they were being given shelter or were under house arrest, he said, although one possibility was that Iran thought that it could insulate itself from terrorism by offering hospitality to Al-Qaeda. Overall he maintained that the international community should not give in to Iranian attempts to secure advantage by making promises. "What we have seen is Iranian efforts to extract as many carrots as possible and to put off any action," he said.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[German jobless face long hard winter as unemployment continues to rise by Sim population. The increase was much sharper than analysts had been expecting and was in fact the steepest rise since March. Unemployment in Germany has been increasing steadily since the beginning of the year, with a total 148,000 more people on the dole in September than in January. The Bundesbank data are seasonally adjusted. A nominal decline in the raw or unadjusted numbers published separately the Federal Labour Agency in Nuremberg was solely attributable to the fact that unemployment usually decreases at this time of year at the start of the school term and as factories re-open after the summer holidays. The labour office calculated that the unadjusted jobless total fell by 90,000 to 4.257 million in September. But that decline did not herald any fundamental improvement in the labour markets, said labour agency president Frank Weise. "Economic developments in Germany remain positive. But there is no sign of an improvement yet on the labour market. The the beginning of the year now stands at 88,000. But that was more a result of the fact that people were increasingly being employed in so-called mini-jobs (tax-exempted low-paid jobs), but could still continue to claim unemployment benefit, she suggested.]]></c>

His main rival for the presidency in Saturday's vote, Yunus Qanooni, meanwhile addressed more than 2,000 in a Kabul football stadium notorious as an execution ground under the former Islamic Taliban regime. Karzai, whose first attempt to campaign beyond the capital was aborted after a rocket attack on his helicopter last month, received an enthusiastic welcome from a crowd of about 10,000 people in Ghazni, about 100 kilometres (63 miles) south of the capital. Security was tight for the US-backed candidate, with American bodyguards beefed up by truckloads of soldiers on the streets, roads blocked and heavy searches of everyone entering the gardens. The crowd, carrying posters with Karzai's picture and banners reading "Karzai is the symbol of unity", chanted Allahu Akbar (God is great) and "Long live Karzai", against a background of traditional drumming. At one stage Karzai stepped down from the podium to shake hands with the audience, which included hundreds of women, but was swiftly urged back by his bodyguards. Supporters of the Taliban regime ousted by the US-led invasion in late 2001, who have been waging an insurgency in the south, have pledged to kill presidential candidates and disrupt the vote. Karzai told the crowd, which local officials said numbered 50,000: "When I see this number of people, in their thousands, I'm delighted and I'm sure that I will win." Karzai said he was happy to see pictures of other candidates as well his own while on the way to the meeting, adding: "I urge you, whoever among the candidates gets elected you should support him. "I want your free votes. If someone comes with money or if a government official puts pressure on you to vote for me you should remember that this is going to be a free and secret ballot. You should not vote under pressure. "Your vote does not only elect your president but it lays the foundation of a peaceful, stable, prosperous Afghanistan." Karzai outlined his vision of a new Afghanistan, saying change had already begun. "Today's Afghanistan is not yesterday's Afghanistan. Today the rule of the gun has been limi Karzai, who is widely tipped to win later returned safely to the capital, his spokesman said. He is due to address a rally at the same venue Wednesday, the final day of official campaigning ahead of the October 9 vote. Seventeen other candidates are standing for election, but Qanooni, 47, a former education minister, is seen as Karzai's main competition. With tension mounting ahead of the vote, nearly 60,000 Afghan police and soldiers backed by 27,000 international troops were moving into position at 5,000 polling stations in anticipation of attacks by insurgents.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PRAGUE, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The tiny Czech village of Horni Benesov has decided to award US Democrat presidential candidate John Kerry honorary citizenship as his ancestors hailed from the hamlet, its mayor Josef Klech said Tuesday. Kerry's Jewish great-grandparents Benedikt and Mathilda Kohn and grandfather Fritz Kohn came from the small mountain town of 2,300 inhabitants in the east of the Czech Republic. "We are proud to have such a connection with a US presidential candidate and want to show that the descendant of Jewish great grandparents from such a small place can go on to achieve great things," Klech told AFP. "That's why we've decided to award the village's first ever honorary citizenship to him," he added. Fritz Kohn changed his name to Friedrich Kerry in 1901, three years before emigrating to the United States with his wife Ida, Kerry's grandmother. He also changed his religion to Catholicism. Klech said the village had invited Kerry to travel to Horni Benesov to accept the honorary citizenship. "If he is elected president I can imagine he will be too busy to come so a delegation from the village will have to travel there. But if he is not elected then I am sure that as a senator he will come within six months," he said. A memorial park and plaque containing an image of the street where the family lived and the text of the American Constitution is also planned for a corner of the village square. "The memorial would be a tribute to democracy," Jiri Frkal, director of the project's organisers, public relations company Media Flow, told AFP. The project would cost between two and five million koruna (64,000 to 159,000 euros, 78,000 to 195,000 dollars). Private companies would be asked to meet the cost, he added.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[BAGHDAD, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw paid a surprise visit to Iraq on Tuesday amid new controversy over why the United States and Britain went to war against Saddam Hussein's regime. Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, back from a tour of Western countries, was to address the Iraqi parliament after the Pentagon warned of more operations to crush the insurgency. US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld meanwhile said he had seen no "strong, hard evidence" linking former Iraqi dictator Saddam with Al-Qaeda, backing away from a key justification for the US-led war on Iraq. Rumsfeld also warned that there needed to be more action against rebel towns in Iraq to pave the way for planned elections in January, after a massive weekend offensive on Samarra that the US military said killed scores of insurgents and led to the arrest of many more. Britain's Straw held talks with top British and Iraqi officials in the northern city of Kirkuk before travelling to Kurdistan, where he met Jalal Talabani, leader of thivilian toll was much higher. The military also said it arrested 126 insurgents since Friday, as troops continued to comb the city for wanted militants. "What has to be done in that country is what happened in Samarra over the last 48 hours," Rumsfeld said in Washington on Monday. Several Iraqi officials have hinted in recent days that the rebel cities of Fallujah and Ramadi may be next on the list. Fallujah has seen almost nightly raids by US warplanes on suspected hideouts of operatives of Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, the most wanted man in Iraq and alleged Al-Qaeda representative. His Tawhid wal Jihad (Unity and Holy War) group has been blamed for a slew of car bombings, kidnappings and beheadings of foreigners. Many analysts believe militant and Islamist foreign fighters began flocking to Iraq only after the US-led invasion in March 2003. Iraq's former administrator Paul Bremer said the United States never had enough troops to control the country and that this may have contributed to the current state of lawlessness. There are about 133,000 US troops deployed currently in Iraq in addition to 23,500 from other countries. Rumsfeld also said he knew of no concrete intelligence tying Saddam -- who was captured in December and now faces trial on charges of crimes against humanity -- to Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. "To my knowledge, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence that links the two," he said. On the ground, one US soldier was killed and two others injured when their convoy hit a roadside bomb near Baghdad overnight. Based on the latest Pentagon figures, the death brings to 1,056 the number of US troops killed in Iraq since the invasion. South of Baghdad, four Iraqis were killed Monday in a drive-by shooting in the area of Latifiyah, the site of almost daily attacks on US military convoys, Iraqi security forces, truckers suspected of transporting goods for US forces and foreigners traveling the main nief Mohammed Sameh al-Ajluni said his company was too small to pay the ransom but that it had already complied with the demands to end operations in Iraq. Another hostage ordeal ended positively Monday when two Indonesian women were set free at the United Arab Emirates embassy in Baghdad. They were kidnapped by the Islamic Army in Iraq four days ago along with their two Lebanese employers and six Iraqis who remain in captivity. But another kidnapping ended with a video showing the execution of two hostages including an Iraqi with Italian residency. On the political front, Poland's defence ministry said it would soon fix the date for the pullout of its 2,500 troops after President Aleksander Kwasniewski said it would take place by the end of 2005. Italy's Italian Defence Minister Antonio Martino also said the withdrawal of foreign troops could strengthen democracy. Both countries are two of Washington's staunchest allies in Iraq, but face strong domestic opposition for their role.]]></c>

Still, the United States needs Brazil's cooperation if there is ever to be a free-trade area of the Americas, with a deadline of January 1, 2005. The two countries came to loggerheads over a US decision to fingerprint travelers from various countries, including Brazil. Brazil, which bases its foreign policy on reciprocity, did the same for US citizens. Brazil is also leading an international stabilization force in Haiti in a bid to quell a political crisis there. On Monday, Powell also blamed supporters of ousted Haitian president Jean Bertrand Aristide for last week's unrest in the Caribbean nation, which is still reeling from deadly storms and floods that killed 1,550 people in September. "These are the old Aristide elements and some criminal elements who are trying to take advantage of the situation," Powell said. "I talked to (UN Secrazil, we'll be going to Grenada, and we'll be stopping at Grenada for a few hours," Powell told reporters shortly before arriving here on a two-day visit. "We can't stay too long because they are still struggling through the aftermath of a hurricane, and the facilities are rather austere, we didn't want to overload the circuits," he said. Some 90 percent of the island's buildings were damaged in the deadly hurricane, which swept across the Caribbean and the United States and killed at least 108 people in a 12-day rampage. Grenada was among the hardest-hit, suffering 37 deaths when Ivan pummelled it September 8.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[JOHANNESBURG, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Citing oil as a cause of instability in the Middle East and Iraq, South Africa's intelligence chief said his country must take steps to protect its sought-after platinum reserves "for the benefit of our people." "The struggle for limited resources such as oil has seen a century of instability in the Middle East and the cycle of intervention and resistance of which the present upheaval in Iraq is just another tragic chapter," Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils said in an address late Monday. The minister spoke of platinum as a key component to develop an alternative energy source, the hydrogen fuel cell. "Platinum is being advanced as a possible catalyst to convert hydrogen into this new form of energy. If successful, then we in platinum-rich South Africa, are sitting on 86 percent of the new energy source of the world," he said. "It is important that we take the necessary security steps to ensure stability and solidarity in our region and continent, and protect our resources for the benefit of our people," said Kasrils, who was addressing a national security conference. South Africa is the world's leading producer of platinum which its Reserve Bank said propelled economic growth in the first six months of 2004. Miners working for the two top groups, Impala Platinum and Anglo Platinum, launched a strike last week to demand better wages. In his address, the minister drew a parallel between countries that have energy resources and instability. Kasrils spoke of attempts to "destabilise West Africa" in the wake of newly discovered oil reserves, a veiled reference to Equatorial Guinea where dozens of mercenaries were arrested in Malabo and Harare on charges of plotting a coup there. Mark Thatcher, the son of the former British prime minister, was arrested in August and charged with helping to finance the alleged plot to topple veteran President Teodoro Obiang Nguema.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Red-faced bosses at a Hong Kong bank Tuesday admitted they had accidentally destroyed 83 safety deposit boxes and their valuable contents in a renovation bungle that could cost millions of dollars. The boxes -- which the bank said likely held cash, heirlooms and jewels -- were kept at a branch of DBS Bank in the southern Chinese territory and had been selected for scrapping by mistake, a spokeswoman said. By the time the error was discovered the boxes had already been crushed by compressors. "This was a case of human error," the spokeswoman told AFP. "We have a team of investigators down there now trying to recover what we can." She said the costly error happened Saturday as contractors renovating the bank in the urban Kowloon neighbourhood mixed up the shoe-carton sized boxes with about 900 empty, unused lockers earmarked for crushing. "When we discovered the error we spent all Sunday and Monday trying to contact the affected customers," she said. "They were understandably upset, angry and disappointed," she added. "Many people had items of emotional importance in there. "You can only guess what kinds of things were inside them." DBS has said it was unable yet to put a value on the lost items but pledged to honour its responsibilities to its customers. "We will see what comes up at the salvage before we begin the long process of establishing what went missing."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[HONG KONG, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Asian share markets closed little changed Tuesday. consolidating the very sharp gains made Monday as oil prices once again rose back through 50 dollars to temper investor enthusiasm, dealers said. By the same token, it was important that the markets digest the recent gains and the underlying positive tone remains in place to suggest further gains are possible, especially if foreign funds continue to come into the region. Dealers said they expect there to be little change ahead of a series of US data due out Friday, including the key September employment report, which will be looked at closely to see if the mid-year "soft patch" in the US economy is indeed over. TOKYO: Japanese share prices closed little changed but on a firmer tone as continued modest support offset profit-taking on Monday's sharp gains, dealers said. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index gained 2.20 points or 0.02 percent to 11,281.83, after rising 2.68 percent Monday, its second-largest gain of the year. The broader TOPIX index of all first section shares rose 0.67 points or 0.06 percent to 1,140.12. Gains led decliners 830 to 621, with 132 stocks unchanged, on heavy turnover of 1.79 billion shares, down slightly from 1.83 billion on Monday. Dealers said the market has now basically recovered from losses sustained on the series of weaker Japanese economic data which came to a halt Friday with a much better-than-expected Bank of Japan Tankan business sentiment survey. The Tankan put confidence amongst large manufacturers at a 13-year high and while pointing to a slowing in growth, the overall picture was positive and enough to spark Monday's sharp upturn. With that now accomplished, the market awaits its next lead. Japan's largest LCD panel maker, Sharp, declined 28 or 1.8 percent to 1,568. Game maker Nintendo was down 130 or 1.0 percent at 13,310, hit by profit-taking after its upgraded profit forecast failed to impress investors. SEOUL: South Korean share prices closed 0.45 percent higher, extending gains for a fifth straight session on continued foreign investor interest, dealers said. After choppy early trade following Monday's stellar gains of more than four percent, the market moved into positive territory by late afternoon and closed modestly higher with the help of foreign investor support. The KOSPI index closed up 4.00 points at 884.84. Volume was 363 million shares worth 2.3 trillion won (2.0 billion dollars). Gains led loser 363 to 347, with 92 stocks unchanged. Foreign investors were net buyers of stocks worth 165 billion won while retail investors were net sellers of shares worth 237 billion won. "The market was supposed to take a pause following yesterday's rally but it firmed up again as foreign investors kept buying stock," Seoul Securities strategist Park Moon-Seo said. "It shows that the market is quite strong. Chances are now high that the key index will breach the psychologically-important 900 points barrier pretty soon although it's uncertain which direction it will take from there," Park said. Samsung Electronics closed down 2,000 won at 488,000 on profit-taking after volatile trade. HONG KONG: Hong Kong share prices closed 0.21 percent lower as investors consolidated sharp gains Monday while sentiment turned cautious as oil prices climbed back past 50 US dollars a barrel, dealers said. The key Hang Seng Index closed down 28.15 points 13,331.10, off a low of 13,304.17 and high of 13,366.87 on turnover of 13.8 billion Hong Kong dollars (1.77 billion US dollars). The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 21.41 points to 4,756.01. "The market was hit by profit taking on yesterday's strong gains. Another factor was the price of crude oil," Rexcapital Asset Management director Alex Wong said. He said th01 and a high of 6,111.23, on turnover of 96.65 billion Taiwan dollars (2.85 billion US). Risers led decliners 380 to 249, with 183 stocks unchanged. "Investors found no reason -- not even the modest gains on Wall Street overnight -- to extend yesterday's rally," SinoPac Securities analyst Teng Ke-hsin said. "A pause is not that surprising after the market succeeded in recovering 6,000 points. The market has to see if that support level will hold." Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. closed down 0.20 Taiwan dollars at 45.30 and United Microelectronics Corp was flat at 21.40. SHANGHAI: Closed SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed up 0.11 percent at yet another record high as gains in the banking and resource sectors offset losses in market heavyweight News Corp., dealers said. They said the tone remains optimistic, with investors remaining confident despite the uncertainties thrown up by the approaching October 9 elections here and dollars. In resources, BHP Billiton was up nine cents at a record 14.84 dollars. SINGAPORE: Singapore shares prices closed 0.11 percent lower as investors consolidated positions in the blue chips after recent sharp gains, dealers said. The Straits Times Index closed down 2.15 points at 2,011.74, while the broader All Singapore Equities index dipped 1.18 points to 523.82. Volume was 649 million shares worth 597 million Singapore dollars (355 million US), down from 757 million shares worth 830 million dollars on Monday. Losers led gainers 170 to 150, while 460 stocks were unchanged. "Profit taking after yesterday's rally was to expected. At current levels, investors will probably take every opportunity to book gains," said a dealer at a local brokerage. Dealers said sentiment also took a hit from persistently high crude oil prices, with the New York futures contract for November delivery remaining above 50 US dollars a barrel on Monday. Ative impact on domestic consumer confidence. "Oil prices will affect consumer confidence in the coming months. The key sectors to be affected are semiconductors, primarily because of a slowdown in external demand, and transport with higher costs of fuel," an analyst with a regional brokerage said. Among blue chips, Tenaga Nasional was down 0.10 at 11.20 ringgit, while Telekom Malaysia was up 0.10 at 11.60 and Maybank fell 0.10 to 11. BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed 0.77 percent lower on late profit-taking after technical problems cut short the trading day, dealers said. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) composite index lost 5.25 points to close at 673.88 and the blue-chip SET 50 index was down 0.35 points at 47.15. Losers outnumbered gainers 222 to 83 with 69 stocks unchanged on trade of 1.8 billion shares worth 18.3 billion baht (439 million dollars). Ekpittaya Eamkongeak of Capital Nomura Securities said the market was active even though morning trade was lost after more than half of the brokers' computers failed. "After recent market gains investors devoted the afternoon session to profit taking," he said. Bangkok Bank closed 1.50 baht lower at 95.50 baht. Siam Cement lost 4.00 at 250.00. JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed 0.57 percent higher with late gains in Telkom and select blue chips offsetting broader market losses and lifting the index to another record finish, dealers said. They said investors are now waiting to see the new cabinet to be announced by President-elect Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who has promised that he will have more professionals than political party representatives in his government. He is due to take office on October 20. The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index closed up 4.869 points at 861.318 on volume of 3.03 billion shares worth 1.9 trillion rupiah (207 million dollars). Declines led advances 63 to 60, with 96 stocks unchanged. Dickygs Equities said. "There's no doubt about it; in general terms volumes are well and truly up for September and look to be for the start of this month as well. It still feels like we've got a reasonably buoyant environment for equities," Willis said. Market leader Telecom gained two cents to 6.01 dollars. BOMBAY: Indian share prices closed 0.13 percent lower as investors paused for breath after four days of sharp gains triggered by sustained fund flows on the back of strong economic growth figures, dealers said.

		<d><![CDATA[GROZNY, Russia, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Chechnya swore in its latest pro-Moscow president, Alu Alkhanov, on Tuesday, five years into the republic's latest separatist war, while tanks and nervous gun-toting soldiers secured the shelled-out capital. Alkhanov walked solemnly along a red carpet in a makeshift blue tent in Grozny, with hundreds of soldiers standing guard outside. Separatist rebels in the Caucasian republic have threated to assassinate the latest leader to be imposed on them by Russian President Vladimir Putin through an election they argue was staged. Alkhanov told the gathered dignitaries that Chechnya was turning "a new page in its history". "We can only conquer terrorism in our land by acting together," he said, in remarks broadcast on television. "I understand perfectly well that by coming to lead the Chechen republic, where we are fighting fanatics and international terrorists, I have turned into public enemy number one for a varied group of extremists," Alkhanov said earlier in an interview published in Russia's Trud daily Tuesday. "But this is not new to me. I have already survived four assassination attempts and was attacked nearly a dozen times," he said. "If my own life had been my prime concern, then I doubt I would have ever returned to this republic." Putin sent Alkhanov a brief message from Moscow saying he was "confident" he could heal a region bruised by a decade of poverty and war. A tall, mustachioed man of 47, Alkhanov served as Chechen interior minister. He gained broad respect in the republic for his ability to stay out of factional politics while trying to keep peace in one of the most restless spots on earth. But he was thrust onto Russia's political stage with the assassination on May 9 of the pro-Moscow Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov, a controversial but powerful former mufti whom Putin trusted to bring the republic back under Kremlin control. Kadyrov's death left a power vacuum in the Caucasian republic. One of the strongest forces remained in the hands of Kadyrov's burly son Ramzan, who runs Chechnya's feared security service. The service stands accused of abductions and other rights violations. But Ramzan, 28, was too young to stand in the Chechen presidential election on August 29 and Alkhanov emerged as the next logical choice. He easily won in the controversial vote, in which his main challenger was barred from competing. "I am a member of Akhmad Kadyrov's team," Alkhanov told Trud. "We clear understand who must do what to lift the republic out of these ruins." Some of his more recent comments have been interpreted as being more conciliatory toward the rebel resistance than the official Moscow stance. Alkhanov once said he was ready to stage talks with anyone as long as these led to peace -- seemingly breaking the Kremlin line that Moscow would never negotiate with "terrorists". Putin reaffirmed Moscow's stance Tuesday. "It is unacceptable to attempt to bargain with terrorists or to build any plans involving them, or behave in any such way. "It is important not only to neutralize the terrorists themselves, but also to isolate their political lobbies and their ideologues." Alkhanov qualified his own earlier comments in Tuesday's interview. "I did not say that I am ready to hold talks with (rebel leader) Aslan Maskhadov. I said that I am ready to speak to anyone if this dialogue will lead to peace and security in the Chechen republic. "I propose to people who really want peace in our republic to apologize for all the suffering they caused to our people. "The people are tired of war and want to live in peace. It is time for the bandits to understand this and leave the people alone."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[GAZA CITY, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Hamas has struggled to put on a united front on its rocket attacks against Israel since the army's massive offensive in Gaza, with the Palestinian group's political wing having to craft a more pragmatic line. If the rockets fell silent, the radical movement would be seen as having capitulated in the face of Israel's week-old "Days of Penitence" operation that has claimed close to 80 Palestinian lives. Publicly, Hamas has vowed to keep up the cross-border firings into southern Israel, while officials from the political wing have hinted at scenarios that that would allow the attacks to stop. "It is clear that both parties (political and military) support the firing" of the homemade Qassam rockets, named after the armed wing of Hamas, said analyst Ghazi Hamas, a figure close to the Islamic group. "There are no differences." But a senior political Hamas official, Ismail Haniyeh, said the rocket attacks could stop if Israel halted its "aggression". The Israeli army, meanwhile, has vowed to continue its offensive despite international criticism of the heavy death toll just as long as the Qassams keep flying. Haniyeh's comments came just shortly after the Qassam armed wing, in a rare press conference in the Jabaliya refugee camp targeted by the Israeli offensive, vowed to battle on. He has since expanded on his comments to explain that he was referring to all Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip and not just the offensive in the north of the territory. "What I said on Saturday was a repetition of the position we have always had. that the Qassam rockets aim to repel the occupier and protect the Palestinian people," Haniyeh told AFP. "If the Israeli aggression stops, not only in northern Gaza but the whole of the territories, and (Israel's) assassinations are halted, Hamas and the other groups will seriously look at a halt to attacks, including rockets," he said. Another analyst, Abdallah Hourani, said the two wings of Hamas saw the conflict in a different light. "The politicians see each issue from different angles while the military side only thinks of inflicting losses," he said. Hamas has come under political pressure due to the high cost in human lives, while Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qorei has said a halt to the rocket attacks would deny Israel any pretext for its offensive. The movement has its sights set on next year's planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. "One of the (Palestinian Authority) conditions for Hamas joining the political scene in the Gaza Strip is a halt to attacks on Israel from the territory," said Hourani. But the stakes are high for both Israel and Hamas, which since September 28 have been locked in a deadly tug-of-war over whether the army will be seen to have been forced out of Gaza under fire. Politically, the movement would have much to gain in the new Gaza.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[May the quarks be with you: Nobel Physics winners explain tiny matter.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[STOCKHOLM, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[US scientists David J Gross, H David Politzer and Frank Wilczek on Tuesday won the 2004 Nobel Physics Prize for developing a theory that explains quarks, nature's tiniest building blocks, the Nobel jury said. "The discovery which is awarded this year's Nobel Prize is of decisive importance for our understanding of how the theory of one of nature's fundamental forces works, the force that ties together the smallest pieces of matter - the quarks," the jury said. By an elegant mathematical formula, the laureates have enabled science to finally dream about finding explanations for some of nature's greatest enigmas of the cosmos, such as the dark matter that seems to dominate space. Their work is an important step in scientists' attempts to provide a unified description of all forces of nature -- "a theory for everything". Science's current best shot at such a theory is the Standard Model of Particle Physics, which describes the smallest objects in nature and how they interact. The model builds on Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the laureates are credited with having found the last remaining piece of the puzzle. Quarks build the protons and neutrons of the atomic nucleus, atoms join up to form molecules, the molecules build up structures, "and in this way the whole universe can finally be described." The trio's specific discovery, made three decades ago, concerns the so-called strong force, or "colour force", which is dominant in the atomic nucleus. This force grows stronger as quarks separate and weaken to almost zero as they get closer, a phenomenon that can be compared to a rubber band. The more the band is stretched the stronger the force. The Nobel jury acknowledged that the relevance of their discovery for daily life can appear hard to grasp. But using the example of a coin spinning on a table, it said that 80 percent of the coin's weight is due to the interaction between quarks. "This year's Nobel Prize is about this interaction," it said. Contacted by telephone, Gross told Swedish media that he was only somewhat surprised to find himself awarded a Nobel prize. "I am of course honoured," he said in quotes reported in Swedish, adding the award was "to some extent" expected. "Over the years as the experimental proof got better and better I knew that the theory was correct. It made sense that this theory should one day share the honours with the other discoveries on fundamental forces." Wilczek, who was once Gross' graduate student, told Swedish news agency TT he was having a hard time regaining his composure after the news, and said his parents' reaction was most "touching". "This means a lot to them. They grew up during the depression in difficult conditions so this has been a long journey for my family," he said. The laureates will receive a gold medal and share a cheque for 10 million Swedish kronor (1.1 million euros, 1.3 million dollars) at the formal prize ceremony held, as tradition dictates, on December 10, the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prize's creator Alfred Nobel. On Monday, the Nobel Medicine Prize went to US research duo Richard Axel and Linda Buck for their pioneering work on mammals' sense of smell. The Chemistry Prize will be announced on Wednesday, the Literature Prize on Thursday and the Peace Prize on Friday. This year's edition of the coveted prizes rounds off with the announcement of the Economics Prize on October 11.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Spanish PM will testify before March 11 attacks inquiry (ADDS quotes, detail).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[MADRID, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero will appear before a parliamentary commission probing the March 11 Madrid train bombings, but the date has yet to be set, chairman Paulino Rivero said Tuesday. Rivero said Socialist leader Zapatero, who had expressed his willingness to appear, would testify after October 21. Former conservative prime minister Jose Maria Aznar is also to appear, but the date has also yet to be confirmed. Rivero welcomed the moves to call both men to testify to the commission saying "this is an exceptional issue." Three weeks ago Aznar's Popular Party (PP), which lost a general election three days after the bombings in which 191 people died, lambasted the inquiry's decision to call Aznar as a witness. PP spokesman Eduardo Zaplana slammed the whole affair as "a pantomime" after his party called -- albeit at the last minute -- for Zapatero also to be called. That proposal was rejected but Zapatero himself promptly said he was willing to appear out of a sense of responsibility to the country. Mariano Rajoy, who led the Popular Party to defeat on March 14 having taken over the party leadership from Aznar last year, had accused Zapatero of "hiding himself away." Zapatero will be the penultimate person to testify before the commission with the spokeswoman of the victim's association, Clara Escribano, to appear last of all. The next appearances are scheduled for October 15. Rivero said last month that 13 other people would appear aside from Aznar, including experts in Islamic terrorism and senior police figures from the northern Asturias region, the origin of the explosives used in the blasts. Fringe parties canvassed the Socialists and the PP for Aznar to be questioned over what exactly happened in the days following the blasts. In the days following the bombings the PP and Aznar insisted Basque extremists were responsible, even as evidence emerged pointing the finger at Islamic extremists. Most of the suspects since detained in connection with the attacks are Moroccans. A link to Islamic extremism would have been dangerous for the PP as it would have suggested to Spanish voters that the bombings were in revenge for Aznar's strong support for US policy in Iraq. Before it emerged that either Aznar or Zapatero would appear a July opinion poll showed most Spaniards believed the investigation would find out "little" or "nothing" regarding March 11. Rivero said all testimony should be wrapped up by mid-November.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[South Korea says China would be drawn into war on peninsula by Jun Kwanwoo (RECASTS, INSERTS analysis).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[SEOUL, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[China is ready to deploy 400,000 troops in support of its ally North Korea if a second war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, according to a South Korean military report presented Tuesday. Chinese support would also include 800 aircraft and 150 navy vessels, according to the report presented by South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to parliament. JCS chairman Kim Jong-Hwan told a parliamentary hearing that China would be inevitably drawn into any war on the peninsula, as it was five decades ago, because of its mutual defense treaty with North Korea. "China is expected to provide limited military support according to a provision of the mutual assistance treaty stipulating automatic engagement," he said. North Korean troops backed by Chinese forces fought against South Korean and US-led UN forces during the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in stalemate. US troops have since been stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact. Kim expressed concern about North Korea's 1.17 million-strong armed forces on top of 6.34 million reserve forces, compared with US and South Korea troops numbering 720,000. But he said this time round a surprise North Korean invasion of the South would not work, referring to a defensive plan that would allow US and South Korean troops to "quickly repel and destroy" attacks. Experts say Beijing may handle its approach toward Pyongyang on a case-by-case basis, acting on national interests, although their military ties will stay intact. "It will cooperate with North Korea sometimes and be in tension at other times, presenting carrots and sticks simultaneously," Suh Jin-Young, a politics professor at Korea University in Seoul, told Yonhap news agency. He said China would put pressure on its neighbour North Korea when its national interests are threatened. At Tuesday's parliamentary hearing, opposition lawmakers called for strong ties with the United States, saying Seoul was vulnerable to North Korean artillery attacks. The opposition Grand National Party insists the capital could fall to North Korea within 15 days of an outbreak of an inter-Korean war if the United States pulls out troops from the peninsula. Meanwhile, the JoongAng Ilbo, a major Seoul daily, said South Korea had devised secret contingency plans in the event of North Korea collapsing. Under the plans, disclosed at a parliamentary audit Monday, Seoul would speedily move to take control of the North and be able to accommodate at least 200,000 refugees flooding out of the Stalinist state. The newspaper said South Korea's unification minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs would take over as ruler of post-collapse North Korea. South Korea has also designated public facilities such as schools and stadiums to house North Korean refugees if the communist regime lurched towards collapse, it said. South Korea's military has also set up 10 refugee camps to house North Korean defectors near the inter-Korean border, it said. The South Korean government said parliamentary discussions on the plans were confidential. But the daily said the plans were initially drawn up in 1994 when former North Korea president Kim Il-Sung died, and have been updated.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Top seeds Lazio of Italy drew last year's semi-finalists Villarreal, English Premiership side Middlesbrough and the experienced Partizan Belgrade in the UEFA Cup draw made here on Tuesday. Greek minnows Egaleo were the other team drawn in Group E but they were not expected to be in the running for the three qualifying slots into the last 32. It was new territory for Europe's second-tier club competition as for the first time they employed a group system instead of the straight home-and away knockout format. Eight groups of five were drawn with the sides playing four games each, two at home and two away based on a complex UEFA grading system. The top three teams from each group go through to join the eight teams placing third in the existing Champions League groups as the competition returns to direct knockout. Group A also looked like being a tough battle with Feyenooord of the Netherlands, Schalke 04 of Germany, FC Basel of Switzerland, Hearts of Scotland and Ferencvaros of Hungary being pooled together. Former winners Newcastle are in with Sporting Lisbon, French outfit Sochaux, Panionios of Greece and Dinamo Tblisi in Group D while Scottish giants Rangers, who needed a penalty-shoot out to defeat Maritimo in the last round go up against Auxerre of France, AK Graz of Austria, Amica Wronki of Poland and Alkmaar of the Netherlands in Group E. The other group top seeds were Parma of Italy, FC Bruges of Belgium, Stuttgart of Germany and AEK Athens of Greece.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Romania, Bulgaria on course for 2007 EU entry.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Romania and Bulgaria, left out of the wave of EU expansion which this year brought in 10 new countries, are now set to join the bloc on schedule in 2007, according to an EU report to be released Wednesday. They "will be able to fulfill all the criteria" for joining the union in January 2007 and the accession treaty is likely to be signed early next year, according to the document cited Tuesday by a diplomatic source here. But the European Commission report does not give a start date for accession talks for Croatia, which had wanted to join in 2007 along with Bulgaria and Romania, the source said. And it recommends that Croatia should be warned that its membership talks could be suspended if it does not improve its democratic and human rights standards. Croatia, which proclaimed independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 amid a four-year war, obtained official EU candidate status in June and hopes to start accession talks early next year. The commission report, the latest in the EU executive's annual declarations on candidate states, is due to be published Wednesday, when another commission document on Turkey is expected to say that Ankara is ready to begin talks on joining the European club. The report will say that Romania now has a "functioning market economy," able to withstand the competitive pressures inside the bloc, the diplomatic source said. Bulgaria was last year deemed to have a functioning market economy, a benchmark set by the EU for membership. Bulgaria closed its EU accession negotiations in June, but Romania has still to complete some areas of its entry dossier, notably in environmental, competition and legal fields. It is aiming to close the chapters by the end of this year. The two neighbouring countries dragged their feet in implementing reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989 and were excluded from the wave of mostly central and eastern European states that joined the EU in May, boosting its members to 25 countries. They were allowed begin accession talks four years ago. Aside from corruption and crime, energy has been a major issue in Bulgaria's accession talks. But Sofia has committed itself to shutting down by 2006 two nuclear reactors in Kozloduy in the north of the country, plants which provide nearly half of the country's electricity needs but which Brussels said are a safety hazard. Outgoing EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen has said the commission will keep a watchful eye on how Bulgaria carries out promised reforms, notably putting into practice a "monitoring system" to oversee its fight against corruption and organized crime. Romania's target of ending accession talks by December was called into question earlier this year by the European Parliament, which pressed Bucharest to do more to ensure its judges are independent and to protect children, as well as fighting corruption. Since then the Romanian parliament, accused of not doing enough to stop trafficking in children, has tightened adoption laws so that only grandparents can adopt a child abroad. A costly reform of the judicial system has also been approved.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Top Elf executives appeal in massive corruption trial by Cecile Baraille.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[PARIS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[One of France's biggest corruption cases ever is to be aired again Wednesday when two former executives of the Elf Aquitaine oil group appeal against convictions for embezzling hundreds of millions of euros. Alfred Sirven, 77, and Andre Tarallo, also 77, head a list of 15 people appealing November 2003 convictions on catch-all charges of "abuse of company assets" after an eight-year investigation of the formerly state-owned group. The charges arise from a massive slush fund involving about two billion French francs (305 million euros, 375 million dollars), said to be run by Elf as part of an elaborate system of government-sponsored influence-buying. Former Elf head Loik Le Floch-Prigent is notably absent from the new case, having decided not to appeal against a sentence of five years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros. Details of the case revealed a network of secret payments called the "hold up of the century" by Jean Veil, a lawyer for Elf which joined the case as a civil party considered to have suffered prejudice. Le Floch-Prigent acknowledged the massive sums involved had inebriated those involved, telling a court hearing: "It is an enormous company that erodes your sense of reality. Everything at Elf was taken to excess." Tarallo, the oil group's so-called "Mr. Africa", had built a sprawling villa estimated to be worth 23 million euros on the Mediterranean island of Corsica with stone from Venice and red granite from Brittany. According to Le Floch-Prigent, Sirven -- a top executive with wide ranging responsiblities -- paid 9.3 million dollars for a Paris town house to be used by the former Elf head, who also received five million euros to pay for his divorce. Sirven, arrested in the Philippines in 2001 after a four-year manhunt, is appealing against a five-year sentence and a fine of one million euros. Tarallo was sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of two million euros. Sirven has emerged as an enigmatic figure with a colourful -- and shady -- past: a French Resistance fighter who also saw combat in Korea in the 1950s and held up a bank in Japan before developing a brilliant talent for managing human resources. Elf, which has sometimes been described as the unofficial face of France in Africa, has been mentioned in connection with a number of financial controversies. Money from the company funded domestic presidential campaigns, Le Floch-Prigent revealed without naming names. Sirven said it was widely known that Elf funds had been channelled illegally into French political parties, telling the court: "It was a secret to no-one that Elf had been used for things like this since forever." Donations have been established to leaders of Angola, Cameroon, the Congo Republic, Gabon and Nigeria as well, but because such commissions were not deemed criminal at the time no-one from those countries has been charged. On November 12, 2003, the Paris court which handed down the first ruling said: "There is in this case, neither chance, nor coincidence: Everything was carefully planned, organised, and then executed." Elf, which was privatized in 1994, is now part of French giant Total -- formerly known as TotalFinaElf.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[CHERBOURG, France, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Greenpeace demonstrators chained themselves to a truck near a nuclear treatment facility in western France Tuesday in a bid to stop an imminent shipment of US military-grade plutonium ro had attached themselves under and inside the vehicle, which had the words "Stop Plutonium" written on its side next to a nuclear symbol. The truck itself was immobilised by a big metal slab, blocking the road leading to the Cogema nuclear recycling facility in La Hague, near the town of Cherbourg. Greenpeace members said all of those who took part in the protest were arrested. A spokeswoman for the state-owned plant, Laurence Pernod, criticised the action as "a media-seeking gesture designed to fool the public". She added: "We don't understand how a militant organisation that has always been against nuclear weapon proliferation could rise up against an operation meant to neutralise them." Two British-registered vessels carrying 140 kilograms (308 pounds) of plutonium from US weapons arsenals were expected to dock in Cherboug after a voyage from North Carolina. The plutonium is to be taken to the French nuclear reconditioning plant at La Hague, then sent to a facility in southern France to be recycled and eventually returned for civilian use in the United States. One Greenpeace militant at the protest, a German named Thomas Breuer, said the organisation wanted "to focus attention on this very dangerous and completely unneccesary transport." Greenpeace has said the long distances of road transport involved constituted "considerable" risk, not least because the cargo's cs not closed to traffic. The truck -- which had no escort -- had been carrying the uranium from Germany to a nuclear power plant in southern France where it was to serve as fuel. One official, Julien Charles, said the cargo would be transferred to another truck which would complete the journey, this time with an escort.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Fourty-three wine waiters from as many countries will take part in the 11th edition of the Worlds Best Sommelier Competition from Wednesday until October 12 in Greece. Organisers, the International Sommeliers Union (ASI) expects more than 500 experts from journalists to oenologists to attend the event which has taken place at irregular intervals since 1969. Candidates from as far afield as Iceland, Peru and Korea will first take a written test Friday on the wine-growing Greek island of Santorini, followed by a practical examination Sunday in Athens. Tested subjects vary from how wine grows to how it is stored, served, and accompanied by other drinks, cigars or chocolate. Four finalists will compete blind-folded in a wine-testing session before an international jury at Athens Concert Hall on October 12. In the last trials, finalists will be called on to correct an erroneous wine menu, compile a menu combining wine and dishes and conduct a decanting operation. Rivals include Britain's Gerard Basset, Herve Pennequin from the United States, and France's Franck Thomas, the 2000 European Sommelier champion. France's Olivier Poussier, winner of the last competition in Montreal four years ago, will not be present. The event was originally scheduled to take place in the United States last year but was moved to Athens instead. "The war in Iraq, security issues and international trade problems have led us to believe that the venue of the competition should be moved to an area where there would be fewer causes for concern and conflict for all those involved," ASI President Giuseppe Vaccarini said in a message. "We hope that our American members and the US sponsors will excuse us," he added.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[EU to give Turkey green light but long road ahead by Michael Thurston.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The European Commission remained tightlipped Tuesday about a crunch report on Turkey's EU hopes, but it is widely expected to say Ankara is ready to begin entry talks while warning there is a long road ahead. The EU executive's report, to be released Wednesday, is also tipped to warn notably that the European Union could suspend or even break off negotiations at any point if it is unhappy with Turkey's progress. EU leaders are set to use the commission's recommendations as a basis for a decision at a mid-December summit on whether to finally start membership talks with Turkey, four decades after Ankara first sought to join the European club. Brussels spokesmen rebuffed all questions about what is in the report, but almost all its findings have already been leaked, including the key one that "Turkey sufficiently fulfils the (EU's) political criteria to begin" talks. Although the core message is good news in Ankara, the array of caveats are causing some alarm, particularly the warning that the talks could be called off if the EU is unsatisfied with Turkey's reforms. The report will also say that Turkey is unlikely to actually join the EU until "well into the next decade," while stressing the need for the EU to constantly monitor not only reforms pledged but their implementation on the ground too. Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul on Monday rejected any suggestion of "special conditions" for Turkey. "That is out of the question," he said in Ankara. Gul has expressed confidence that the Brussels report will pave the way for a positive decision at the EU summit on December 17. In theory, if that summit gives Turkey the thumbs up, negotiations should start "without delay," although diplomats say there are question marks about this, with some suggesting they could pledge to launch the talks in 2006. Turkey has been waiting to join the European club since 1963 but its efforts have stumbled over its civil rights record. Opponents have long argued that Turkey is simply too big and too different to fit into the EU. Turkey now however appears to be set for good news. But it is under no illusions about how soon it can join, with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan saying Sunday that membership talks could last until 2019. The commission report will also say, according to leaked copies, that while there has been progress in stamping out torture in Turkey, boosting freedom of expression and of the press and in Ankara's treatment of its large Kurdish minority, there remains a lot of work to be done in these areas. The annual cost of Turkey's EU entry by 2025 would be between 16.5 and 27.5 billion euros or between 0.1 and 0.17 of the bloc's gross domestic product, according to a commission impact study leaked last week. One cloud hanging over the whole project is a pledge by French President Jacques Chirac to hold a referendum on Ankara's EU hopes. In theory such a vote could simply reject Turkish EU entry, whatever happens in the negotiations. The next head of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, said Monday he welcomed the idea of referenda in EU member countries. "It is a mistake to assume that a decision of this importance can be taken against the will of Europeans," said Barroso. The final version of the report is set to be approved by the 30-member commission in Brussels on Wednesday morning. EU enlargement chief Guenter Verheugen, who last month said there were "no more obstacles on the table" to Turkey's EU hopes, will then immediately present it to the European Parliament in Brussels, before presenting it to reporters.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[PERTH, Australia, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The Anglican church of Australia refused Tuesday to follow its counterparts in the United States, Canada and New Zealand in allowing women to become bishops. After lengthy and emotional debate, a meeting of the church's General Synod in the Western Australia capital of Perth agreed in principle that women could be ordained as bishops. But a vote to ratify the move by the church's bishops, clergy and lay members failed to reach the necessary two-thirds majority, the same outcome as the last time the issue was debated at the synod in 2001. Women have been allowed as deacons in the Australian Anglican church since 1985 and have been priests since 1992. But conservatives led by the Archbishop of Sydney Peter Jensen succeeded in ensuring the episcopate would remain all-male. After agreeing on the idea of women bishops in principle by a simple majority, the synod needed a two-thirds majority in each of its three houses -- bishops, clergy and laity -- to pass the protocols of the bill. In a secret ballot, 17 out of 23 bishops supported the move, but only 63 out of 106 clergy backed the measure -- eight votes short of the needed majority -- while 67 of 106 laity voted in favour, four votes short. Jensen said the vote ratified his reading of the Bible's scripture but admitted the Anglican Church as it existed may be being outpaced by society. "The constitution of the church prevailed, in that it protected the minority -- and a pretty substantive minority did not want this," Jensen said. Muriel Porter, a staunch advocate of female bishops, said she would keep struggling for the church to change. "I think the church has made a grave mistake. I won't give up, I will keep struggling for it, and praying for it," she said. The Anglican church has about a dozen women bishops in the United States, New Zealand and Canada.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KHARTOUM, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair is to pay a brief visit to Sudan Wednesday for talks with Sudanese leaders on several issues, including the Darfur crisis, officials here confirmed Tuesday. Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail, quoted by the official Al-Anbaa daily, said Blair would meet with President Omar al-Beshir and Vice President Ali Osman Taha, among others. Their talks will focus on bilateral issues as well as the peace process with southern rebels and the situation in the strife-torn western Darfur region, Ismail said. The two sides will also discuss how Britain can help in alleviating Sudan's foreign debt, the situation in the Horn of Africa, Iraq and the Palestinian territories, he added. Blair's visit, the first to Sudan by a British premier in many years, "comes in the framework of the continued consultation" between the two countries, according to Ismail. It coincides with a parallel visit to the country by Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, but it was not immediately clear if the two leaders would meet. Khatami met Beshir after his arrival on Monday and was scheduled to address the Sudanese National Assembly (parliament) and give a lecture Tuesday on dialogue between cultures. Ismail said Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi, who is accompanying the Iranian leader, would travel to Darfur Tuesday to see the situation there for himself. Sudan has been encouraging Islamic states to contribute towards humanitarian efforts in Darfur to counter Western aid agencies, which the government accuses of using relief assistance to spread Christianity in the region. The United Nations says the 20-month conflict in Darfur, which has left some 50,000 people dead and displaced an estimated 1.4 million from their homes, has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The UN Security Council passed a resolution in September that threatened sanctions on Sudan's vital oil industry over the government's failure to rein in pro-government Arab militias blamed for many of the atrocities in the region. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's special envoy to Sudan, Jan Pronk, was due to brief the Security Council later on Tuesday on Sudan's compliance with the resolution on the Darfur crisis. Ismail said he expected a positive report. "I expect the report will be comprehensive and will focus on the positive aspects and on what can be done in the coming period," he was quoted as saying.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[MANCHESTER, England, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Two cars owned by Manchester United director Maurice Watkins have been daubed with red paint in an attack police believe may have been the work of fans opposed to a takeover of the club. Paint the colour of United's shirts was sprayed on Watkins' cars in the driveway of his house near Manchester late on Monday, a spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said. The attack came hours after United confirmed they had received a a preliminary takeover approach which is understood to have come from US tycoon Malcolm Glazer, owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL franchise. Glazer, who currently holds a 19.2 percent stake in the world's richest club, was able to increase his holding earlier this year by snapping up around one million of his shares -- just under 0.4 percent of the company -- which Watkins had put up for sale. Watkins is the club's legal advisor and remains the largest individual shareholder on the United board with a stake equivalent to 1.9 percent. He would have had no control over the eventual ownership of the shares he sold. The 61-year-old solicitor is a well-known football figure. He helped draw up new international transfer regulations for UEFA and FIFA and is invariably at the side of United stars embroiled in disciplinary cases, most recently Rio Ferdinand when he was banned for eight months for missing a doping test. United supporters' groups have vowed to oppose any takeover by Glazer. Militant fans flexed their muscles earlier this year with a string of protests targeted at the club's biggest shareholders, Irish racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus. The Irish duo, who own 28.9 percent via their Cubic Expression company, had irked some of the United faithful by demanding greater transparency in the club's transfer dealings -- a move that was widely seen as being linked to a personal dispute between Magnier and club manager Sir Alex Ferguson. In 1999, United fans succeeded in seeing off a 623-million-pound takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch's satellite broadcaster BSkyB, which was eventually blocked on competition grounds.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[KHARTOUM, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Libya and the African Union Tuesday invited Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir to a mini-summit in Libya on the Darfur crisis, due to be attended by Sudan's neighbors Chad and Egypt. This came during a meeting between Beshir and Libyan leader Moamer Khadafi's special envoy, Said Arabi Hefiana, and Nigeria's junior foreign minister, Aboubakar Tanko, who is also assistant secretary general of the AU. Hefiana and Tanko delivered the invitation in letters from Khadafi and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, the current chairman of the AU, which is sponsoring peace talks between Khartoum and Darfur rebels. The official Al-Anbaa daily on Tuesday quoted Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail as saying the letters also dealt with the situation in Darfur and efforts by the AU to resolve the 20-month conflict there. Hefiana and Tanko flew to Khartoum from Egypt where they delivered a message to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, also inviting him to the summit. Following the meeting, Egyptian presidential spokesman Maged Abdel Fattah told reporters consultations were underway to determine the exact date of the summit, which was to take place "before October 21". The summit was part of ongoing AU efforts to "contain the situation in Darfur", where conflict has left some 50,000 people dead, displaced an estimated 1.4 million and forced nearly 200,000 to flee into neighboring Chad. It also aimed to "fend off the consequences of United Nations Security Council resolutions and consolidate the role of the AU in dealing with the conflict," Abdel Fattah said. The UN Security Council passed a resolution in September threatening sanctions against Sudan's vital oil industry for the government's failure to rein in pro-government Arab militias accused of atrocities in Darfur. The visits of the Libyan and AU envoys coincided with a meeting in Ndjamena, Chad, of the AU's ceasefire committee and representatives from the Sudanese government and the two main rebel groups in Darfur. Ismail told A-Anbaa participants would also discuss the situation in Darfur and ceasefire violations by Sudan and the Darfur rebels. He reiterated his government's acceptance of the Security Council resolution on Darfur calling for an increased number of AU troops in Darfur and broadening their mandate, saying this would help in the process of confidence-building, particularly between the police and displaced persons. Sudan recently agreed that the AU could deploy its troops in camps for displaced persons in Darfur to monitor the activities of the police. Ismail said the move would reassure the displaced, many of who accuse the police of complicity in attacks against them by Arab militias and encourage them to move freely in and out of the camps. The news comes as British Prime Minister Tony Blair prepared to pay a brief visit to Sudan Wednesday for talks with Sudanese leaders on several issues, including the Darfur crisis.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Runaway oil prices put ECB in dilemma on rates by Simon Morgan.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[FRANKFURT, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[With oil prices at record highs, the European Central Bank is likely to delay as long as possible any rise in eurozone interest rates for fear of putting the brakes on the stuttering economic recovery, analysts here said Tuesday. Runaway oil prices, which bounced back above 50 dollars a barrel in London on Tuesday, put the guardian of the euro in a difficult dilemma. On the one hand, they fuel headline inflation in the single currency area, which the ECB has vowed to keep below 2.0 percent. On the other, surging oil prices put the brakes on economic growth. And in the case of the lacklustre eurozone economy, that could choke off the modest recovery altogether. Thus, when the ECB's decision-making governing council meets for its regular monthly meeting -- this time in Brussels -- on Thursday, the bank is not likely to announce any changes in interest rates, analysts predicted. The bank's central 'refi' refinancing rate has been fixed at 2.0 percent since June 2003. And in a poll of 31 economists by AFP and its financial news subsidiary AFX, all said they were expecting no change in rates this week. Nevertheless, with borrowing costs already on the rise in other countries, notably the United States and Britain, the ECB may have to begin tightening monetary conditions in the 12-country eurozone soon. The majority of economists are pencilling in an upward move in the first or second quarter of next year. Already last month, the ECB appeared to begin preparing the ground for a rate rise, saying it would monitor inflationary risks with increased vigilance in face of oil price developments. Despite the ECB's more hawkish tone, however, "the risks to growth stemming from the global slowdown and persistently high oil prices will outweigh the risks to price stability," said Goldman Sachs economist David Walton. At the recent G7 meeting in Washington at the weekend, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet appeared to share that view, saying that if oil prices continued to climb it would pose "a serious problem" for the world economy. Another ECB governing council member, Luxemburg's central bank chief Yves Mersch hinted in Washington that the euro bank was unlikely to tighten monetary policy, even though eurozone inflation was currently higher than 2.0 percent. "So far, things aren't going too badly (on the inflation front), but we'll have to see how the situation devleopments in the coming months," Mersch said. In fact, area-wide inflation actually slowed somewhat to 2.2 percent on a 12-month basis in September from 2.3 percent in August, flash estimates published by Eurostat showed. That was likely to reassure the ECB and not push it into any hasty raro area. The region's PMI purchasing managers' index and the eurozone confidence index both fell in September. The International Monetary Fund recently urged the ECB to maintain an "accommodative" monetary policy so as not to choke off recovery altogether.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[NEW DELHI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[India's northeastern states, where violence exploded at the weekend leaving 69 people dead, has been a hotbed of discontent for decades with at least 30 rebel groups pursuing varying agendas. The states, dubbed the "Seven Sisters" and home to some 40 million people, are wedged between Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Tibet. More than 50,000 people have been killed in the northeast since India's independence in 1947 from Britain in fighting between security forces and rebels, who claim their cultures are under threat. The rebel outfits waging insurgencies have variously being seeking greater autonomy or independence in the states -- Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura. The states are connected to India by a narrow strip of land and even thinner cultural links, having enjoyed a long history of independence before British colonial rule. All seven states have at one time or another since 1947 faced ethnic strife or insurgency, with the various ethnic groups accusing New Delhi of exploiting the oil, timber and tea-rich region and ignoring its development. Nagaland has India's longest-running separatist insurgency, with the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland waging a bush war against the Indian army since 1947 in which more than 25,000 people have been killed. h New Delhi. In the state of Mizoram, a 20-year-old insurgency came to end in 1986 after a peace deal with New Delhi. Leaders from the Mizo National Front joined politics and the government is headed by Zoramthanga, who uses only one name. But the government has yet to end ethnic strife in Mizoram between the minority Bru tribals and Mizo people. Neighbouring Meghalaya is also wracked by ethnic strife between the Khasi and Garo tribes people. The Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council fighting for a separate tribal homeland for the Khasi people recently entered into a ceasefire with New Delhi.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[TAIPEI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Taiwan's threat last month that it could launch retaliatory missile strikes on mainland China if it is attacked by Beijing were a bluff, according to military analysts. Despite striking a deal with the United States to buy billions of dollars' worth of military hardware, without the nuclear warheads of its arch-rival Taiwan presents a minimal military threat, they say. Premier Yu Shi-kun's comments last month echoed the doctrine of "mutually assured destruction" that maintained peace between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War, but analysts say Taipei has no deterrent sufficient to reach such a balance with China. The comments from pro-independence Yu to Beijing stunned Taiwan. "You have the capability to destroy me and Taiwan should have the capability to counter. You strike me with 100 missiles and I should at least strike back with 50," Yu told a gathering of government officials. "You strike Taipei and Kaohsiung and I shall strike Shanghai. This way Taiwan will be safe," he added. Beijing said the remarks were a "belligerent provocation" while Washington called on the two sides to exercise restraint. Military analysts point out that Taiwan is dwarfed by China militarily, and that Taiwanese troops pose no real threat to the People's Liberation Army. "Unlike the Soviet Union, Taiwan does not possess nuclear arms," said Shuai Hua-ming, a retired army lieutenant general. Taiwan was forced by the United States in the 1980s to scrap its plans to develop nuclear warheads and surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 1,000 kilometers (600 miles). But it has never dropped its ambition to obtain a deterrent, like ballistic and cruise missiles. Taipei's Apple Daily reported at the weekend that the country planned to test fire before year-end a cruise missile that could hit the eastern Chinese city of Shanghai. But Shuai said that conventional missiles, whatever their range, would be no match to a Chinese attack. "Without carrying nuclear warheads, cruise missiles would cause no more damage than making holes in the ground," Shuai said. China's military spending, which rose at rates in the double figures over the past decade, is estimated at 24.5 billion dollars in 2004 -- around three times higher than Taiwan's spending -- according to Taiwan's defense ministry. Alarmed by China's arms build-up, Taiwan reached a deal to acquire more advanced US hardware. Washington is the leading arms supplier to Taiwan despite deciding in 1979 to recognize Beijing instead of Taipei. Taiwan's government is to seek parliament's approval for a controversial 18-billion-dollar special defense budget over a 15-year period from 2005. The package includes anti-missile systems, eight conventional submarines and a fle Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing in July asked the United States to halt military exchanges and arms sales to Taiwan given the "seriousness" of the cross-strait standoff.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Washington Tuesday warned there would be "repercussions" for the United States if Taiwan failed to approve a controversial 18-billion-dollar budget for advanced weaponry to defend itself, officials said. In an interview with Taiwan's TVBS cable network, Richard Lawless, a deputy undersecretary at the US Defense Department, voiced concern about the special budget waiting approval by Taiwan's parliament. "It will be regarded as a signal, if you will, as the attitude of the legislation towards the national defense of Taiwan," Lawless said in Arizona where a three-day defens P-3C aircraft, over a 15-year period from 2005. The budget, already approved by the cabinet, has met opposition in parliament. Some critics say Taiwan cannot afford the massive arms spending while others say the new weaponry will not be delivered in time to help the island fend off any attack from China in coming years. Others say it could fuel an arms race with Beijing, which regards the island as a renegade province and has vowed to retake it by force if Taipei declares formal independence. The government insists Taipei badly needs the weaponry in the face of a sustained arms buildup by Beijing, which has 600 ballistic missiles targeting the island.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[After Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia grapple with land reform by Stephane Barbier.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[JOHANNESBURG, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Four years after Zimbabwe's land reform campaign turned violent, South Africa and Namibia are facing the same conundrum, struggling to redress imbalances from British and German colonial rule. As in Zimbabwe, the vast majority of land in South Africa and Namibia is owned by white farmers, descendants of settlers who under colonial rule were given choice land. President Robert Mugabe seized on this historical injustice to justify the forced seizure of some 4,000 of Zimbabwe's 4,500 white-owned commercial farms that were redistributed to blacks, wreaking havoc in the agriculture sector in what was once southern Africa's breadbasket economy. Farmers in neighboring South Africa and Namibia watched events in Zimbabwe with trepidation, wondering whether the same fate would ultimately befall them despite assurances from the governments that they will uphold the rule of law. South Africa's first post-apartheid government in 1995 set up a two-pronged approach to land reform that provided for the return of property seized by the former regime and an overall redistribution of land. White farmers own 80 percent of arable land in South Africa ane. The Landless People's Movement meanwhile has put President Thabo Mbeki on notice to make good on his promises for land reform or else "the people's anger will break out." In Namibia, land reform is shaping up as a hot-button issue in the runup to the November 15 and 16 elections after the government told some 15 white farmers in May and June to set a price to sell their property to the state. It was the first time that the government in Namibia led by the South West People's Organisation (SWAPO) party has moved to expropriate some of the 3,000 white farmers under its land reform program, but no actual expropriations have happened yet. As in South Africa, impatience is growing and already a group of farm workers are threatening to seize a farm at Otjiwarango, some 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of Windhoek.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Ireland has put on hold a plan to exchange ambassadors with Myanmar as a result of lack of political progress in the southeast Asian country, according to Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern. Ireland established diplomatic relations with Myanmar's military junta in February and its ambassador to Malaysia, Daniel Mulhall, was to have been accredited there on a non-resident basis. At the time Ireland held the six-month revolving presidency of the European Union and then-foreign minister Brian Cowen argued that the appointment of an ambassador would increase Ireland's "influence and credibility" in pushing for human rights and democratic reform. Ahern, in an official comment published on the Internet at the weekend, said Ireland remained strongly critical of the continued house arrest of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the absence of political Myanmar's military junta has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1962 despite the landslide victory in 1990 elections of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[HANOI, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Asian and European leaders gather in Hanoi this week for a inter-regional summit at which terrorism, tension on the Korean peninsula and the political situation in Myanmar are likely to take centre stage. The continuing instability in Iraq just months before elections are due to take place and the threat of weapons of mass destruction are also expected to dominate the two-day Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), which formally opens Friday. "European and Asian leaders are confident this summit will identify ways to reinforce effective multilateralism in the face of current regional and global challenges," Markus Cornaro, head of the European Commission's delegation to Vietnam, told AFP. Bringing together heads of state and government from Europe and Asia, this fifth edition of the biennial summit welcomes for the first time the 10 new members of the European Union as well as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, French President Jacques Chirac, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun are among the world leaders jetting in for the meet, which stands to be an enormous test of Vietnam's organizational mettle. The communist nation hosted a summit of French speaking nations in 1997, and the following year staged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, but those will be dwarfed by the more than 1,000 delegates from 25 European and 13 Asian countries converging on Hanoi this week. joined ASEAN in 1997 and almost led to the EU boycotting this week's summit. The 10-member ASEAN bloc had wanted its newest members -- Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar -- to be included in the summit in return for the participation of 10 new EU members who joined in May. The EU objected to Myanmar's presence and only agreed to attend last month on condition that the regime send a lower-ranking delegation. But the EU also warned that it would tighten the tough sanctions already in place unless the junta bows to its human rights demands, which include the release of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest. "We don't want to make this a one-issue summit, but the Myanmar situation will definitely be raised by the European side," a Hanoi-based diplomat said. Friday's second session will centre around promoting a "sustainable Asia-Europe economic partnership" amid globalization, energy and environmental challenges. There will also be talks on establisage Hisham Talab al-Ezza, told AFP. He said the abductors want the ransom to be paid by the employer. Ezza's wife, Hikmat, said the demands must be met by the end of the day Tuesday. "They want want the ransom or Ajluni by the end of the day. Otherwise they said they will kill him," she said at her home in Amman. Ajluni, regional director of the Iraqi transport firm Starlite, told AFP he cannot afford the ransom but that he is willing to negotiate with the abductors. "I too am an employee of this company, just like the hostage. I have 51 employees. It is impossible to pay half a million dollars each time one of them gets into trouble," Ajluni told AFP by telephone Tuesday. "I stopped the firm's activity as they requested and destroyed my life. I am ready to negotiate on the amount (ransom) requested but I cannot do more than that," he said. In a videotape broadcast Saturday night by Al-Arabiya television, Ezza said he was being held by an Iraqi group demanding that Starlite stop its actitivies in Iraq, otherwise they would kill him within 72 hours. The identity of the group was not revealed. Immediately afterwards, Ajluni told AFP he halted the firm's company. Ajluni also insisted that the company is Iraqi owned and that he received a call Monday from the hostage and "told him to get in touch with the concerned parties in Iraq," such as the company's legal advisor, Qassem Ali Obeid. Obeid had gone on television Monday to plead for Ezza's release and tell the abductors that his firm was ready to negotiate. Hisham's family have pleaded for his release, saying he was a father of six who went to Iraq four months ago simply to earn a living. They insisted he had no connection with US forces in the embattled country.]]></c>

Germany's ambassador to Vietnam, Christian-Ludwig Weber-Lortsch, tacitly acknowledged last week that the rift remains unresolved. "There have been some problems between the EU and ASEAN over the Myanmar issue, but I believe they will not hijack or overshadow the global summit." The fifth edition of the biennial meet was almost scuppered as a result of the EU's boycott threat in protest at Myanmar's planned attendance. The 10-member ASEAN bloc had wanted its newest members -- Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar -- to be included in the summit in return for the participation of 10 new EU members who joined in May. The EU only agreed to attend on September 3 on the condition that Myanmar sends a lower-ranking delegation. But it also warned that it would tighten the tough sanctions already in place unless the military dictatorship bows to itty and allowing genuine political debate. Myanmar's junta, which has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1962 despite the NLD's landslide victory in 1990 elections, launched a national convention earlier this year which it billed as the first step in its "roadmap" to democracy. This process has been rejected as a sham by many Western governments. Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa lamented the fact that the controversy over Myanmar's participation's this week "has tended to deflect attention away from what the actual forum is all about". "So we, as far as Indonesia is concerned, would like to bring the ASEM process back on track," he told AFP.]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Three years on, Taliban little more than ragged bunch of extremists by Michaela Cancela-Kieffer KANDAHAR, Oct 5 (AFP) - In I think they don't support them," Khaksar said. "The Afghan nation is really tired of the war during the last 25 years." The Taliban who ruled most of Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, belonging to a fundamentalist movement whose aim was to revive the earliest forms of Islam, "are sitting in refugee camps in Pakistan and don't fight anymore," according to Pakistani journalist and writer Ahmed Rashid, a Taliban expert. "Today it is just an extremist movement." Khaksar agreed. "There are no Taliban today. A Talib is someone who has had religious studies and has fought for religion, but many now have not studied a word," he said. According to police in southern Afghanistan, those who now claim to be from the movement are recruited in Pakistan, in refugee camps and madrassas, or Koranic schools, and are essentially split in two branches. "One is the group of Mullah Omar and one group is the group of Syed Akbar Agha, the chief of Jaish-e-Muslamin," another Islamist group, Kandahar intelligence chief Abdullah Laghmanay told AFP. Mullah Omar loyalists attack in groups, he said, while Agha's men form small militant cells of two or three people. But most of the time, offensives are limited to quick hit and run attacks, proving "that they are only a small number," Khaksar said. Rashid, also pointing to their weakness, estimates that "they are divided into several groups." "Even the military fronts are not politically clearly united. They don't have a political strategy or ideology." Estimates of their strength in numbers vary. Some say there are 1,500 to 2,000 active fighters while others like Rashid put the figure higher at "3,000 to 4,000." "There is a lot of recruitment in camps and madrassas," he said. But their ability to operate inside Afghanistan "is limited because of US operations and the lack of logistics," Rashid said. Some members of the movement have not been hostile to calls from incumbent Presidery criss-crossed by bomb-shattered roads and mined fields, where some two million farmers make their money by growing opium poppies. Afghanistan is "locked in a vicious cycle in which a largely informal economy, the opium trade and violence reinforce each other," the World Bank said in a recent report. Untangling the legacy of 25 years of conflict and re-establishing the rule of law will be a painstaking process, but failure will leave the country locked in the dark ages and controlled by a narco-mafia. Afghanistan now is further behind economically than it was in the mid-1970s when it had a thriving tourist industry and an agricultural sector that exported internationally. Thirty-five percent of Afghanistan's gross domestic product comes from the poppy crop, compared with 29 percent from other agriculture and only nine percent from manufacturing, according to the World Bank report. With no modern agricultural equipment, fertilisers or pesticides Afghan farmen Unit. A five-year drought has added to the woes of a desperately poor population, whose average per capita income stands at little over 300 dollars, including money earned from growing opium. President Hamid Karzai, seen as the favourite to win October 9 polls, has offered little in the way of concrete economic policies, but a government report in April this year estimated that agriculture would need nine percent annual growth for opium eradication to be viable. International donors pledged in April to give the struggling state 8.2 billion dollars over the next three years, well short of Kabul's request for 28 billion dollars over seven years. The drugs trade has strengthened the grip of regional warlords, who use drug money to fund local militias and have no interest in seeing a strong government. "Opium production and trade has become Afghanistan's leading economic activity, supporting powerful warlords and a drug industry which has a strong interest in preventing the emergence of an effective, accountable state," said the World Bank. Without a robust central government, Afghanistan stands no chance of developing tools, such as a banking system and capital markets, which would bring the country into the 21st century and allow long-term investment to bolster job growth. "The drug problem reflects a much more important issue which is the absence of the rule of law and to rebuild a modern state you need a foundation based on the respect for the law or you are not going to get foreign investors coming in here," said Andrew Wilder, director of the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit.]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[THE HAGUE, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[The trial of Naser Oric, the former commander of the Muslim forces in the Srebrenica enclave, on war crimes charges for alleged atrocities against Bosnian Serbs during the first two years of the Bosnian war, will open at the UN court here Wednesday. Oric, 37, is the first Muslim to be charged with war crimes committed in the Srebrenica area but his alleged crimes are not related to the 1995 massacre of 7,000 Muslims by Bosnian Serb troops. The arrest and transfer of Oric in April last year sparked controversy among Bosnian Muslim survivors of the massacre. Some were outraged because they consider Oric a hero who fended of Serb troops, while others say he is a criminal and profiteer who made a fortune on the black market in Srebrenica. Oric, a former bodyguard of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, defended Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia during the war as the Bosnian Serb troops laid siege to the Muslim enclave. "I believe Naser is an honourable and honest man who was just trying to defend his people," Srebrenica survivor Munira Subasic told AFP. "Let them try and prove his guilt, I don't think they will succeed," she added. Oric left the town two months before before it fell to the Bosnian Serb forces who summarily executed over 7,000 Muslim men. Some clad War II, the killings will loom large in the background. "It will be essential for the judges hearing this case to have regard to the persecutory, indeed genocidal, campaign of the Bosnian Serbs against the Bosnian Muslims in eastern Bosnia," Oric lawyers said in a court document outlining the defence case. "It was in response to this brutal campaign of Serb 'ethnic cleansing' that mr Oric. organized the resistance against the Serbs." They argue that Oric had no knowledge of any crimes committed against detainees. According to the defence the attacks on Serb villages listed in the indictment were legitimate actions against military and strategic targets or operations to obtain food for the starving population of Srebrenica cut off from the outside world by the Serb siege. In Bosnia some Srebrenica survivors have lashed out at Oric's version of events. "I know how difficult it was, how we were hungry, exposed to torture and destruction on a daily basis. But if it was food we needed, there was no reason to burn (Serb) houses and destroy already deserted villages," Bosnian journalist Emir Suljagic, who lived through the siege of Srebrenica, said. "No community must place itself above the law. no circumstances justify that," he wrote in Dani magazine after Oric's plea of not guilty in April. The prosecution and the defence have been given four months each to present their case to the court.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Verdict due in Greek ELA group trial by Harry Papachristou.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ATHENS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Five suspected members of Greece's oldest radical group, the People's Revolutionary Struggle (ELA), will hear the verdict of an Athens special court Wednesday, after eight months of proceedings. The suspects, four men and one woman, are all over 50. Their trial is Greece's second major courtroom drama involving radical factions, following the 2003 conviction of members of the November 17 urban guerrilla group. The ELA process could mark the symbolic end of Greek authorities' efforts to crack down on homegrown radical groups. Greece's active radical scene formed during the country's US-backed 1967-1974 military junta and sustained action under different labels after the reestablishment of democracy. Marxist ELA, which was founded in 1975, has claimed responsibility for two assassinations and some 250 bomb attacks on police stations, US institutions, banks and public buildings. However, it officially suspended operations in 1995. The five suspects, including alleged ringleader Christos Tsigaridas, stand accused of having carried out more than 70 bomb attacks, including one on a police van in 1994 in which an officer was killed. They are also charged with having instigated the assassination of a public prosecutor in 1989. The suspects werermer head of a village council in the Aegean island of Kimolos, accused Kyriakidou of having plotted against him to take revenge for their divorce. In July, public prosecutor Eleftherios Patsis reduced the charges against four suspects to membership of ELA and possession of explosives as well as having some role in the two killings and the bomb attacks. "The accused here were simply accomplices to unknown perpetrators," Patsis said in his closing arguments. Patsis even dropped ELA membership charges against suspect Michalis Kassimis, brother of the group's founder Christos slained by police in 1977. But Kassimis could still face life in jail if the three-judge special court finds him guilty of "active participation" in the attempted murder of a trade union leader in 1987. If the judges stick to Patsis' curtailed charge-sheet, as widely expected, the suspects risk prison sentences of up to 25 years, compared with the multiple life terms they faced on the original, N, Oct 5 (AFP) - The main New York oil contract climbed to a new record high level of 50.49 dollars a barrel in electronic trading on Tuesday amid worries about production stoppages in the Gulf of Mexico. Almost 30 percent of the Gulf of Mexico's 1.7 million barrels of daily oil production remains disrupted because of the hurricane season, according to the US Minerals Management Service, a government agency.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Tough UEFA draw for top seeds Lazio (ADDS quotes, details).]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[GENEVA, Switzerland, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Top seeds Lazio of Italy drew last year's semi-finalists Villarreal, English Premiership side Middlesbrough and the experienced Partizan Belgrade in the UEFA Cup draw made here on Tuesday. Greek minnows Egaleo were the other team drawn in Group E but they were not expected to be in the running for the three qualifying ss of Scotland and Ferencvaros of Hungary being pooled together. Former winners Newcastle are in with Sporting Lisbon, French outfit Sochaux, Panionios of Greece and Dinamo Tblisi in Group D while Scottish giants Rangers, who needed a penalty-shoot out to defeat Maritimo in the last round, go up against Auxerre of France, AK Graz of Austria, Amica Wronki of Poland and Alkmaar of the Netherlands in Group E. Newcastle director Russel Cushing was confident of advancing. "We've won five and drawn one of the last six games in the Premier League and Europe, so we're on form at the moment," said Cushing. "It's a team that I personally don't know too much about," he said about Sochaux, "but they've played in European competition before, we never expect any easy games." Sochaux sporting director Bernard Genghini said they were relishing discovering English football. "They're (Newcastle) are obviously the group favourites, it can't be denied. It's going to be a new experience for our young team and a tough group. "We're going to discover English football in capacity-filled stadia. Newcastle is the club of Alan Shearer, and the French striker Laurent Robert. It's going to be a new atmosphere for us." Each club will play two matches at home and two away on October 21, November 4, November 25, December 1-2 and December 15-16. The winners, runners-up and third-placed clubs from each group will advance to the last 32 where they will then be joined by the eight third-placed clubs from the Champions League group stage. The competition will then revert to a two-leg knock-out format. The final will be played in Lisbon's Jose Alvalade Stadium on May 18, 2005.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Arguments for and against Turkey joining the EU.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[BRUSSELS, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[As the European Commission prepares to give its verdict on whether Turkey is ready to start talks about joining the EU, herewith key questions and answers in the debate about its membership. - Wouldn't Turkish membership cost European taxpayers a fortune. The annual cost by 2025 would be between 16.5 and 27.5 billion euros or between 0.1 and 0.17 of the bloc's gross domestic product, according to a Commission impact study leaked last week. EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler warned last month that Turkey's inclusion could cost 11.3 billion euros a year in agricultural subsidies. EU regional development aid could reach 10 billion euros a year, according tok tank in Brussels points out that "our union is so big that even the 'big' (countries) are no longer so big." - Would millions of Turks flood the EU labour market. Some 2.7 millions Turks could over the long term leave their country to go and live and work elsewhere in the EU if Turkey joins the club, according to a committee led by former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari. That figure is the equivalent of 0.5 percent of the union's total population. But many economists say such immigration would be beneficial because of the ageing European population. "Long transition periods and a safeguard clause could be considered to avoid serious disturbances in the EU labour market," says the draft impact report. "However, the population dynamics of Turkey could offset the ageing of EU societies." - How can such a vast mostly-Muslim country join the mainly Christian EU. "The successful inclusion of Turkey in the European integration process would give clear evidence to the Muslim world that their religious beliefs are compatible with EU's values," said the leaked Commission impact study. It added that Turkey could be an important model of "a Muslim majority country adhering to such fundamental principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedom and the rule of law." Supporters of Turkish membership point out that country has a secular government. Opponents reply that the European part of Turkey is prosperous and liberal, while the much larger Asian part is traditional and very conservative.]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Turkey's homosexuals come out for their rights by Sibel Utku Bila =.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[ANKARA, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Long oppressed in a largely conservative society, Turkey's homosexuals are timidly coming out for their own share of freedoms as the couside other civic groups to work in commissions on health care and AIDS prevention. In a milestone move earlier this year, gay and lesbian activists were for the first time received in the Turkish parliament to convey their appeals for legal protection. Their main demand -- to make discrimination "on the basis of sexual orientation" a jailable offense -- was first included in the draft of a major reform overhauling Turkey's penal code, which the EU was pressing for. The amendment would have marked the first political victory here for the movement and made Turkey the first Muslim nation to guarantee legal protection for gays and lesbians. But the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), a conservative grouping with Islamist roots, dropped the plan -- making homosexuals happy at a time when the government has yet to deliver on promises to its own religious electorate might have been a step too far. "To blame the AKP alone would be misleading," Erol said. "There the mainstream human rights movement. "The EU process is encouraging people to speak out and it is changing official attitudes," he said. "It is a pity, however, that so many things in Turkey change not because the people demand it, but because they are EU criteria."]]></c>

		<d><![CDATA[DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Long-forgotten, ignored and oppressed in their corner of southeast Anatolia, Turkey's 13 million plus Kurds impatiently await the country's entry into the European Union to lay to rest their turbulent and often tragic past. The situation today is a far cry from just 10 years ago when, in the heat of a separatist uprising by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Turkish officialdom still chose to largely ignore any Kurdish identity in this country. As part of its efforts to join the EU and live up to the bloc's standards on minority rights, Ankara over the past couple of years broke decades-old taboos with Kurdish-language broadcasts on state radio and television and the creation of private schools -- packed with students -- that teach Kurdish. "It's a pity all this didn't happen earlier. People have better feelings now, they are less negative," said Kurdish instructor Ibrahim Halil Tas, 35, in Diyarbakir, the main metropolis of Turkey's largely poor, Kurdish-majority southeast, where mere mention of the EU brings smiles to people's faces. "I dream of a Turkey that belongs to Europe -- we have no reason to envy the Europeans," said Mehmet Senocak, 19, a student who faces an uncertain future in this region where unemployment is way above the national average. Joining the EU may be "painful" at times, Senocak said, but will, in the long run, benefit his people after years of frustration. The Kurds fought alongside Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, during the country's war of Independence between 1919 and 1923. But their later rebellions against the central authority -- most notably in 1925 and 1937 -- always ended in blood and tears. Most Kurds are completely integrated in Turkish society and have rarely been victims of individual acts of racism and opression, but always sought to preserve their ethnic identity -- that was where the problems began. For decades, the authorities in Ankara refused to grant them any rights, going so far as to deny their very existence, saying in the nationalistic 1970s that "There are no Kurds -- only mountain Turks." This may have been one of the reasons why, in 1984, Kurdish nationalism erupted in the form of the PKK, a group considered to be terrorist by Turkey and many European countries and international organisations. Under its founder Abdullah Ocalan, the PKK waged a ruthless battle for an independent state in the sout's credit that we enjoy the rights we do today," said Cerkez Aktan, 39, who holds a stall in downtown Diyarbvakir, "and we hope things will be much better when we finally become fullmembers of the Union." "Ten years ago, we could not even have imagined what we have today," commented another tradesman, Seyhmus Aslan, 51. He praised the government's efforts on Kurdish rights and, standing in his small shop, gave fellow Kurds the same advice the European Union is giving Turkey. "Be patient," he said. "The road to Europe will be long and hard. Things don't happen overnight -- they take time."]]></c>

		<t><![CDATA[Owen vows to silence critics.]]></t>
		<d><![CDATA[LONDON, Oct 5 (AFP).]]></d>
		<c><![CDATA[Michael Owen has vowed to silence the critics calling for him to be axed by England after a troubled start to his career with Real Madrid. The 24-year-old's place in his national side is under seriocountry -- 27 goals in 63 games being combined with a tendency to strike when it matters most. "I have a record of scoring in big games and big tournaments. I am not a kid. I am an experienced international." The striker also dismissed suggestions that he owed his place in Eriksson's side to the fact that he, like David Beckham, is one of the coach's alleged favourites. "He selects me for what I can do for the team and not for any other reason," Owen insisted. "I have probably spoken to him three times outside of England camps. No cosy meals, no cosy nights out. "His loyalty to certain players is being portrayed as a weakness, but I think the country would be more worried if he started chopping and changing and looked indecisive." Owen was due to miss England's first training session for the Wales match on Tuesday but he said he was hopeful of being back in training by th end of the week. Provided he can prove his fitness, Eriksson is widely expected to keep faith with Owen and drop Defoe, who scored a superb goal in his full debut against Poland last month, back to the bench. Owen partnered Defoe in Poland but one of them has to make way following the return to action of Wayne Rooney, who is an automatic choice after his outstanding displays at Euro 2004. Eriksson will also be making changes at the back and in midfield. Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell are expected to resume their 2002 World Cup partnership in the centre of defence following Ferdinand's return from his eight-month suspension for missing a doping test and Campbell's recovery from an Achilles injury. In midfield, Eriksson has lost Steven Gerrard and Wayne Bridge to injury. David Beckham, Frank Lampard and Nicky Butt will occupy three of the midfield spots but the troublesome berth on the left looks up for grabs with Owen Hargreaves, Phil Neville and Joe Cole among the contendors.]]></c>

Liberation said the French embassy in Syria requested visas itself for Julia to enter the country, while Le Monde strongly hinted that the whole affair was an under-the-table ransom payment gone wrong. Responding, foreign ministry spokesman Herve Ladsous admitted the embassy in Damascus had acted on behalf of Julia and his team because "we did not want to frustrate their initiative, even though we had not been informed of what it consisted." Chesnot and Malbrunot's families issued a statement Monday asking "all of France's representative figures to not get into debates that could undermine the national consensus and, at the same time, have consequences on the liberation of Christian and Georges." Raffarin held crisis talks on the issue with ministers and party leaders Monday and Tuesday. Afterwards, the leaders of the Socialist and Communist opposition parties agreed to rally to the call for national unity, although Socialist party leader Francois Hollande insisted that government "clarification" on Operation Julia must still be forthcoming. Raffarin, for his part, stressed that Julia "carried out a personal initiative with no official mandate". The visa request notwithstanding, he said "the government did not approve it (the mission), does not approve it, and did not support it". Liberation, in an editorial, summed up what it and other media have labelled a "fiasco". Either the government was so completely lost in its efforts to free the reporters it clutched "at a straw knowing it to be rotten" or Chirac's office "used its right hand to ampute its left (Julia)". Julia was at fault, it said, "but in the end it's Jacques Chirac who is accountable for the fate of the hostages."]]></c>
