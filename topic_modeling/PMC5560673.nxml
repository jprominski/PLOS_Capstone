Biomaterials are the scaffolds that give three-dimensional support to the cells, and are vectors that deliver the cells to the injured tissue requiring repair. Features of biomaterials can influence the behaviour of the cells and consequently the efficacy of the tissue-engineered product. The adhesion, distribution and motility of the seeded cells onto the scaffold represent key aspects, and must be evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> during the product development, especially when the efficacy of a specific tissue-engineered product depends on viable and functional cell loading. In this work, we propose a non-invasive and non-destructive imaging analysis for investigating motility, viability and distribution of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) on silk fibroin-based alginate microcarriers, to test the adhesion capacity of the fibroin coating onto alginate which is known to be unsuitable for cell adhesion. However, in depth characterization of the biomaterial is beyond the scope of this paper. Scaffold-loaded MSCs were stained with Calcein-AM and Ethidium homodimer-1 to detect live and dead cells, respectively, and counterstained with Hoechst to label cell nuclei. Time-lapse Light Sheet Fluorescent Microscopy (LSFM) was then used to produce three-dimensional images of the entire cells-loaded fibroin/alginate microcarriers. In order to quantitatively track the cell motility over time, we also developed an open source user friendly software tool called <italic>Fluorescent Cell Tracker in Three-Dimensions</italic> (<italic>F-Tracker3D</italic>). Combining LSFM with <italic>F-Tracker3D</italic> we were able for the first time to assess the distribution and motility of stem cells in a non-invasive, non-destructive, quantitative, and three-dimensional analysis of the entire surface of the cell-loaded scaffold. We therefore propose this imaging technique as an innovative holistic tool for monitoring cell-biomaterial interactions, and as a tool for the design, fabrication and functionalization of a scaffold as a medical device.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Conto Capitale 2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9856-7053</contrib-id><name><surname>Santi</surname><given-names>Spartaco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO ASTF 233-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piccinini</surname><given-names>Filippo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro-AIRC</institution></funding-source><award-id>MFAG-16491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duchi</surname><given-names>Serena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Dr. Spartaco Santi was supported by grants from the Ministero della Salute: "Conto Capitale 2013" Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute; Dr. Filippo Piccinini was supported by a European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO, Heidelberg, Germany) short term fellowship (EMBO ASTF 233-2015).

Biomaterials serve as scaffolds to deliver cells and provide both biological signals and physical support for the cells [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The synergism that exists between stem cell biology and biomaterials aims to generate a profound improvement to stem cell-based clinical applications used in tissue engineering. However, the number of stem cell biomaterial-based clinical trials are still limited and the outcomes are not optimized [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are distinct challenges in all facets of this research, given the unique environment resulting from the presence of biomaterials and cells, such as the methods of monitoring and assessing the produced engineered constructs.</p><p>Sophisticated chemistries are used to synthesize materials that mimic and modulate native tissue microenvironments, and at the same time are able to structurally support the cells&#x02019; adhesion and distribution on the biomaterial [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Ideally, a uniform distribution of the cells on the surface or within the scaffold would enable the cells to reach the maximal load on the construct and also to obtain an efficient delivery of cells to the injured site.</p><p>An example of a biomaterial that requires complex chemistries to improve cell adhesion capacity is alginate. Alginate microcarriers are noteworthy targets for applications in tissue regenerative medicine due to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the recent years, alginate microcarriers have also been used as an injectable biomaterial to directly deliver a variety of <italic>in vivo</italic> cells (keratinocytes, fibroblast, and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells), as a resorbable vehicle for biomolecules and drugs for therapeutics and tissues repair [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>However, the surface of alginate is unsuitable for cell adhesion due to the presence of negative charges and the deficiency of integrin domains [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], thus preventing the ability of cells to proliferate and acquire their proper morphology. This therefore leads to dysfunctional behavior and function. These findings suggest that the addition of bioactive molecules to alginate will improve their ability to act as cell carriers [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this regard, silk-fibroin, a fibrous polymer derived from different silkworm species, has been widely used as suitable matrix/substrate due to its high biocompatibility, excellent mechanical properties and abundance of cell binding motifs (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid, RGD) in its structure, which enhance cell attachment and proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, only a few papers demonstrated the improved adhesion of the cells onto silk-fibroin coated alginate microcarriers.</p><p>Currently, the methods used to characterize the surface of the scaffold are invasive, cause destruction of the sample and don&#x02019;t allow for an accurate assessment of the entire surface of the construct. At present, the morphology of the adherent cells on the surfaces of tissue engineered constructs can be typically observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and confocal fluorescent microscopy after cell labelling [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to observe detailed cellular&#x02014;scaffold information [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, it would be difficult to translate such high-resolution images into consistent cell-distribution results. Considering the light reflection, opacity, dimensions, sample preparation, microscopic visualization of viable and dead cells, and distribution of cells without disruption of the scaffold, the current methods of visualization of the entire structure of the sample are limited to a portion of the scaffold or to the three-dimensional reconstruction from single images. In addition, the visual depth of the confocal laser-scanning microscope is often limited to less than 500 &#x003bc;m depending on the material. Alternative approaches to quantify cell distribution in tissue engineered scaffolds include micro-computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. However, they require the use of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles entrapped in seeded cells [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, imaging techniques for three-dimensional (3D) analyses have been identified as a strategic priority in tissue engineering scaffolds, in order to enable non-destructive, quantitative, and 3D observations [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) has been proposed as an alternative approach to the traditional techniques since it displays the above mentioned features for imaging analyses [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. LSFM is a fluorescence microscopy technique in which the illumination laser beam is shaped into a thin plane of light (usually a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers), and the illumination of the sample takes place perpendicularly to the detection objective. Compared to confocal microscopy, this method minimizes the photodamage and stress induced on a living sample, reduces the background signal and thus creates images with higher contrast. In addition, with LSFM it is possible to obtain multiple views along different angles that can be combined together so that hidden parts of the sample become visible. A detailed 3D volume reconstruction of the sample is thus achievable, even though this feature is not typically offered in conventional multidimensional microscopy imaging systems.</p><p>LSFM is also well suited for imaging large live specimens over long periods of time and is currently established as the leading tool for the study of the development of organisms <italic>in toto</italic>: zebrafish, fly and mouse embryo [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] at subcellular resolution. However in larger animals, tissues or organs [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], 3D cell cultures and spheroids [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] transparency and laser light scatter/absorption becomes a major obstacle in achieving refractive uniformity throughout the specimen. Therefore fixation and chemical clearing are required to allow greater depth of imaging. However, LSFM imaging used to verify the distribution of stem cells seeded onto scaffold biomaterials is still an unexplored field of application. Accordingly, given that LSFM imaging strategies offer high speeds, large and deep fields of view and long-term imaging capacity, we decided to characterize Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells (MSCs) behaviour onto fibroin-coated alginate microcarriers to evaluate the hypothesised adhesion capacity of silk-fibroin to allow MSCs loading onto alginate scaffolds surface. Through LIVE/DEAD<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> labelling onto the whole scaffold and LSFM image acquisition, we evaluated cell adhesion, distribution and motility during time in culture.</p><p>A 3D tracking system was needed to monitor the cell motility on the MSCs-loaded microcarriers. Today, few systems are available for tracking cells/particles in 3D starting from a time-lapse dataset of <italic>z</italic>-stacks of images [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The <italic>ImarisTrack</italic> module (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/imaristrack">http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/imaristrack</ext-link>) of <italic>IMARIS</italic> (Bitplabe, Zurich, Switzerland) is the most complete solution in the field and is used for a wide range of applications, ranging from bacterial to cancer cell analysis [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This software suite provides the user with several low-level routines, permitting the development of individualised custom, high-level, procedures. However, besides being commercially available, it requires good image processing skills to understand how the single routines have to be connected so as to achieve the expected behaviour. On the other hand, <italic>ImageJ</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Welcome">https://imagej.net/Welcome</ext-link>) is a freely available image processing tool, with several plugins for processing <italic>z</italic>-stack of images and tracking cells/particles in 3D. Again, it does not include a ready-to-use procedure and basic programming skills are required to concatenate more plugins suitably and process the input dataset. In order to equip biologists with an off-the-shelf and user-friendly tool to effectively monitor the cell motility on the MSCs-loaded microcarriers, we developed <italic>Fluorescent Cell Tracker in Three-Dimensions</italic> (<italic>F-Tracker3D</italic>).

The capillary was continuously rotated manually for 5 min in order to guarantee the centrality of the specimen during the jellification phase. The glass capillary was mounted in the chamber, which was filled with complete medium without phenol red (DMEM + D-Glucose1g/L + pyruvate w/o L-Glutamine w/o phenol red, # 11880&#x02013;028 Gibco).

In our study, we propose LSFM technique as an innovative tool to overcome the limitations of the current imaging techniques. As far as we know, we are the first to use LSFM to characterize MSCs adhesion, distribution and motility on a microcarrier and to combine LSFM and a 3D tracking system in order to investigate the behavior of MSCs once seeded onto those scaffolds.</p><p>The proof of principle was performed onto silk-fibroin based alginate microcarriers, to verify the acquisition of cells adhesion capacity of alginate after a protein based surface modification is made with fibroin.</p><p>Our LSFM set up allowed us to track the same cells over the spheres for a long period of time, maintaining cell viability without photo-damage or photo-bleaching from the fluorophores derived from the Calcein-AM, Ethiudim homodimer-1 and Hoechst staining. In addition, the ability to simultaneously visualize different markers using multicolour staining approaches is essential when characterizing different statuses of cells in culture. The acquired 3D images clearly identify the whole microcarrier structure, enabling one to determine the cell distribution on the entire microscaffold. In addition, we could observe the motility of single cells and perform computational measurements and produce 3D movies.</p><p>Only a few tools are currently available for tracking cells in 3D using <italic>z</italic>-stack of fluorescent images [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The most noteworthy solution is the <italic>ImarisTrack</italic> module of <italic>IMARIS</italic>. <italic>ImarisTrack</italic> offers a wide choice of multiple automatic tracking algorithms and provides researchers with a set of tools to support their analyses. Cells/particles are tracked in two steps: first, the objects of interest are detected using one or more of the available wizard-driven segmentation tools, then, objects at consecutive time points are related and integrated into a single moving object. Aside from the manual tracking option, three different algorithms have been implemented for this purpose. Although <italic>ImarisTrack</italic> represents the most complete suite currently available, advanced image processing knowledge is needed to correctly execute the single stages and appropriately combine them for an effective analysis of the input datasets. Furthermore, <italic>IMARIS</italic> is a commercial software that is not available to all researchers. The most common public solution for tracking cells/particles is <italic>ImageJ</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In <italic>ImageJ</italic>, a few plug-ins are available for this purpose. Among them, <italic>MTrackJ</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software">www.imagescience.org/meijering/software</ext-link>), <italic>ParticleTracker</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and <italic>TrackMate</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] are noteworthy. <italic>MTrackJ</italic> is designed for manual cell tracking. The user must define the (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) positions for each <italic>t</italic>, resulting in an extremely time consuming procedure. On the other hand, <italic>ParticleTracker</italic> also provides some automatic methods for tracking brightness particles. A recent comparative study has evaluated <italic>ParticleTracker</italic> as one of the best particle tracking options [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, it was designed to track pre-segmented particles, and its usage with cells in 3D applications, such as cells moving on a 3D scaffold, yields particularly complex results. <italic>TrackMate</italic> is the freely available solution that better resembles the segmentation and tracking wizard of <italic>IMARIS</italic>. It is designed to track spots and roughly spherical objects following a two-step scheme where the segmentation and particle-linkage steps are separated. Each step is managed in the user interface by a specific panel, and basic programming skills are required for usage. However, <italic>TrackMate</italic> does not provide any solution for aligning different <italic>z</italic>-stacks of images, therefore requiring other plug-ins or external programs.</p><p>In order to provide biologists with a turnkey solution to monitor cell motility on MSCs-loaded microcarriers, we designed <italic>F-Tracker3D</italic>, an open-source user-friendly software tool for automatically tracking individual fluorescent tagged proteins, cellular structures, organelles and cells in 3D without requiring the user to perform any segmentation stage. Accordingly, no image processing skills or knowledge of the sample is needed. The program simply requires as the input a set of <italic>z</italic>-stacks of fluorescence images acquired in time-lapse, by confocal microscopy or LSFM. For each tracked cell it automatically provides (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) for each time point <italic>t</italic>, and several measurements computed according to the spatial cell displacement.</p><p>By combining LSFM and <italic>F-Tracker3D</italic>, we were able to demonstrate that the motility of MSCs one day after the seeding onto fibroin-coated alginate scaffolds is different compared to 3 days post seeding. One day after seeding on fibroin coated alginate beads, the morphology of the cells are round, typically of cells not yet fully adherent to the surface material. After 3 days, cells start to produce ECM proteins that allows full attachment to the fibroin coating and also provides the adhesive strength that determines the polarized orientation for motility along the surface of the microcarriers [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>][<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>This data could be helpful and suggest that the analyses on cell-biomaterial interactions should be performed several days after cells seeding to allow perfect cell adhesion and elongation along the surface of the desired biomaterial. There may be limitations if cells are seeded on a different type of scaffold. In particular, one of the major limits of LSFM is the light penetration into thick and scattering samples. If parts of the samples have a significantly higher refractive index (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. lipid vesicles, membranes, organelles), they can also lead to a focusing effect resulting in degradation of image quality. To overcome this problem, the light sheet can use dual side illumination and the pivot scan that reduces the presence of shadows behind the scattering structures, or can be combined with two-photon excitation, which improves the accessible imaging depth to hundreds of micrometers and reduces sample-induced aberrations [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. An alternative approach is the optical clearing, a procedure that renders the tissue transparent to light by removing the main scattering source. Although these methods guarantee high transparency, their applicability is limited by protein fluorescence quenching, tissue shrinkage, and incompatibility with live imaging [<xref rid="pone.0183336.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we present microcarriers with a high degree of transparency that minimize the refractive index mismatch between medium and cellular organelles and uniformly maintain the intensity distribution along the light sheet excited signal without chemical clearing methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The method we propose is holistic, non-invasive, non-destructive, and quantitative. It enables a 3D analysis of the entire cell-loaded scaffold. With the combination of LSFM and <italic>F-Tracker3D</italic>, we were able to detect the adhesion capacity of a modified alginate-based scaffold material and the differences in cell motility along the microcarrier surfaces. Moreover, we were also able to produce a holistic view of the cell distribution during time. We therefore propose this imaging technique as a tool for the design of tissue engineering products, as well as for quality control during production process validation, from the fabrication to the functionalization of a scaffold to be used as a medical device.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183336.s001"><label>S1 Video</label><caption><title>F-Tracker3D video tutorial.</title><p>A video tutorial showing how to use <italic>F-Tracker3D</italic> to easily track cells moving into a 3D spherical object.
