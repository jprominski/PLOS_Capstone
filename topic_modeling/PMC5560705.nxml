With the advancements in prosthetic mesh and improvements in tension free repair, the recurrence rate following hernia repair has been reduced dramatically, and hernia outcomes research should focus on post-operative quality of life and potential complications such as chronic non-disabling pain [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Quality of life research in hernia patients usually utilizes generic instruments, which reduces the measurement sensitivity and limits the clinical applications. Indeed, Jensen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have noted the need for standardization in the measurement of quality of life after hernia repair, and an internet-based registry for post-surgery outcomes research for various hernia types has been advocated [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Some hernia-specific outcomes research instruments have been published. The Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) was developed for patients undergoing mesh repairs and was validated in abdominal wall/groin hernias with both laparoscopic and open repairs [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and a preference for the CCS rather than the generic SF-36 was reported. Site-specific instrument such as the COMI-hernia (Core Outcome Measures Index adapted for hernia), which was a groin hernia-specific measuring tool, has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An effective and validated hernia-specific assessment instrument for outcomes research has thus become an urgent need in surgical communities.</p><p>The aim of the study was to provide a validated quality of life assessment tool, HERQL, to facilitate hernia outcomes research. In Taiwan, the National Health Insurance (NHI), which is the only health care system, enrolls 97% of all of the country&#x02019;s medical providers and about 99% of the population [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All inguinal hernia repair surgeries are compensated according to the Tw-DRGs (Taiwan Diagnosis Related Groups) while most mesh devices, especially those commercialized recently, have to be paid at private expense due to the limited NHI budget. Therefore, there are gaps in the coverage and applicability of existing hernia quality of life instruments developed in Western countries. Initially, the HERQL was designed to deal with both inguinal and abdominal wall hernia while in current study only inguinal hernia was addressed. The usability, validity and reliability of the HERQL as well as the application for Taiwanese inguinal hernia patients were performed and reported in current study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institute Review Board of Cathay General Hospital under the access number CGH-P102069. The purpose and procedures of the study were explained by the primary investigator (CSH), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>A. The conceptualization and pilot study of the HERQL</title><p>Initially a quality of life measuring instrument for both inguinal and abdominal wall hernia was proposed, encompassing symptomatic and functional domains experienced by patients with diverse hernia types. Due to the limited cases of abdominal wall hernia and the concern of anatomical discrepancy, only inguinal hernia was addressed in the current study. Here we presented the validation of the HERQL for inguinal hernia in Taiwan, and the applicability of the HERQL for abdominal wall hernia with possible modifications will be evaluated separately.</p><p>The content and dimensions of the HERQL were conceptualized from literature reviews and through panel discussions of the Taiwan Hernia Society (THS). Published hernia-specific instruments including the Activities Assessment Scale (AAS), CCS, COMI-hernia, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and Inguinal Pain Questionnaire (IPQ) were consulted [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183138.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All referred questionnaires were compared and appraised systematically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183138.s001">S1 Table</xref>), and questionnaire items coinciding with the goals of developing the HERQL were retrieved. Candidate items are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183138.s002">S2 Table</xref> and were categorized into four a priori domains, namely symptom, function, operation-related, and patient satisfaction.</p><p>These candidate items were evaluated in the pilot study with 30 pre-operative inguinal hernia patients, with interviews to assess what is important to these patients among these questions, using a five-point rating scale (from the most relevant to not relevant at all). Three operation-related items and eventration were discarded since these items were recognized as irrelevant by hernia patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183138.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Mutually exclusive questions were stacked together while the immediate pain severity and the global outcome/treatment satisfaction were subdivided into more questionnaire items to enhance sensitivity. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183138.s002">S2 Table</xref> showed the relationships between the candidates from literature reviews and the corresponding HERQL scales. It deserves notice that hernia protrusion, analgesic usage, and hernia&#x02019;s impact on health were the HERQL-specific scales and were included in the pilot study as well. The ideal questionnaire length was determined to be no more than 20 items to encourage acceptance after referring to the questionnaire length among published works (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183138.s001">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>Successive explorative factor analyses were performed for the preliminary HERQL to identify any underlying higher-order construct (factor). The Principal component analysis showed that two components explained 57.5% of the variance of the HERQL response and a common factor analysis with the oblique PROMAX rotation further augmented the existence of the two common factors with wide separations of symptomatic and functional variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183138.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). It was anticipated that, based on the results of the pilot study, albeit with a limited sample size and compromised statistic power, did point out that the symptomatic and functional domains would be retained in the final version of the HERQL, whereas the operation-related and patient satisfaction domains were potentially expendable. More details are available in the Supporting Information.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>B. Study population</title><p>Inclusion criteria were patients who planned to or had undergone inguinal hernia repairs at Cathay General Hospital, a tertiary referral institute in Metropolitan Taipei. Both pre-operative and post-operative hernia patients were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were concurrent participation in another human subject study, mental problems with difficulties understanding and completing the questionnaire, and refusal. Demographic characteristics, operation details, and follow-up events were retrieved from chart reviews.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>C. Field study, validation and the conceptual structure of the HERQL</title><p>The HERQL was validated in a large-scale field study with the target sample size of 350 completed questionnaires. Enrolled subjects were asked to fill out the EQ-5D-5L, a brief and generic quality of life instrument, concurrently for the purpose of criterion validation [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (Supplementary methods). The correlations of mobility, usual activities, and pain/discomfort scores of the EQ-5D-5L from the same patient with the corresponding scores of the HERQL (activity restriction, health impact, and pain upon various strenuous activities) were evaluated.</p><p>Internal consistency reliability was evaluated for multi-item subscales, and was defined as a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient greater than 0.70 [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Clinical validity was evaluated by known-group comparisons, which were conducted by comparing patients with stable conditions (post-operative hernia patients without observable complications and with a minimum follow-up time of three months) and those under active treatment (pre-operative patients), under the hypothesis that pre-operative patients might have higher symptomatic scores and lower functional scores. Since quality of life scores were not always distributed normally, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for between-group comparisons. All tests were two-sided, and the Bonferroni correction with a reduced &#x003b1; level of 0.01 was applied for multiple comparisons.</p><p>The clinical responsiveness of the HERQL was evaluated through repeated measurements within the same patient. Only pre-operative patients were proceeded with repeated HERQL surveys, and were re-assessed at predefined time intervals (one week and three months post-operatively). The unconditional linear growth model was used to adjust for clustering of repeated measures on the same individual (Supplementary Methods). Fluctuations of quality of life scores in coherence with distinct clinical scenarios of hernia, such as active treatment (pre-operative), immediately post-operative, and post-operative three-month follow-up, suggested adequate responsiveness of the HERQL.</p><p>In addition to the original multi-item and single-item subscales, higher-order constructs designed to capture the correlations between latent factors for the HERQL were elaborated with the aid of structural equation modeling (SEM) and more statistic details could be found in the Supplementary Methods [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec011"><title>A.

Determination of the HERQL content</title><p>The revised HERQL questionnaire from the pilot study includes a 4-item summative pain score (0&#x02013;10 point Likert-type scale in each item) measuring pain and/or discomfort resulting from rest, mild, moderate, or heavy activities (Q01, Q03, Q04, and Q05). The summative pain score was the additive sum of these four items (range: 0~40). Activity restriction due to hernia-induced pain or discomfort was evaluated with another 0&#x02013;10 point Likert-type scale (Q09). Items categorized into the symptomatic and functional domains measured with 5-point Likert-type scales, included hernia protrusion (Q02), analgesic use for hernia (Q08), hernia&#x02019;s impact on health (Q11), economic burden (Q12), and subjective quality of life/global health perception (Q13), with higher values indicating more compromised functional status or worse symptom burden. Three questionnaire items were designed with checkboxes displaying multiple selections.

The major drawback of the CCS is that it cannot be used pre-operatively.</p><p>The inguinal hernia-specific instrument, COMI-hernia, was designed with a single item each for the domains of pain, function, symptom-specific well-being, general quality of life, and social and work disability pertaining to global treatment outcome, satisfaction, and patient-rated complications [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Completion rates were high due to its brevity. Two pain-focused instruments were the BPI and the IPQ, with the former designed for pre-operative assessments of both abdominal wall and inguinal hernias, and the latter for post-operative surveys and limited to inguinal hernia [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The AAS was targeted for groin hernia repairs with both laparoscopic and open repair approaches measuring limitations in sedentary, ambulatory, work and exercise activities [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The internal consistency reliability of the summative pain score and the clinical validity of the HERQL comparing patients under active treatment and those at the post-operative three-month follow-up was ascertained. With 4 items measuring severity of pain under various strenuous activities, and considering that pain is a deterministic element in hernia disease, a single latent pain factor (summative pain score) was constructed to be independent of other symptomatic measures. Other symptomatic domain items were formative and were postulated to have a causal effect upon the latent quality of life factor. All functional domain items were reflective of the underlying latent quality of life factor, and the post-operative module items were reflective of the underlying patient satisfaction factor.</p><p>Initial efforts to use SEM for quality of life measurement can be traced back to Fayers et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], who aimed at separating the causal variables (symptoms) from the effect indicator variables (functional domains). The causal and indicator variables model forms the basis of the conceptual structure of the HERQL [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The critical theory underpinning the causal-indicative duality is that hernia-associated symptoms may impair subjective quality of life perception, which is subsequently reflected in the functional domains and indicator variables, as well as in patient satisfaction from the postoperative group. Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183138.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183138.g002">2</xref> show the relational diagrams of the original and extended models, indicating the feasibility of SEM approach for the HERQL.</p><p>The clinical responsiveness of the HERQL was demonstrated by repeated measures of the summative pain scores across the pre-operative, immediately post-operative, and post-operative three-month surveys. It is understood that quality of life is a function of time, and the fluctuations of subjective quality of life scores corresponding to clinical scenarios supported the conclusion that HERQL was responsive to changes over time with adequate sensitivity. Since enrolled patients were assessed with an unequal number of repeated measurements, we used an unconditional growth (mixed) model to overcome the problem of missing values, to prevent list-wise deletion of all measures from patients with at least one missing value among successive surveys. Within subject correlations (repeated measures of the same participant) were considered as well. Our results showed that progressively less pain was reported when patients underwent hernia repairs and were stable at follow-up, as compared with the initial untreated disease, demonstrating that patients reported less and less pain and discomfort over time following hernia repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183138.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>Our previous studies have ascertained the efficacy of tension-free hernia repair, which has a low recurrence rate and provides early ambulation [<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183138.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Low failure rates have made &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; end points, such as recurrence or wound complications, less pronounced, so the focus of hernia outcomes research should be directed to &#x0201c;soft&#x0201d; end points such as patients&#x02019; subjective perception and quality of life. The self-reported HERQL questionnaire provides such end points from the patient&#x02019;s perspective.</p><p>There are some limitations of the current study. First, our modest sample size may have resulted in compromised statistical power. Second, we invited all inguinal hernia patients who had visited our clinics during the study period. Although best efforts had been tried, not every pre-operative participant could complete all the successive surveys. Our experience shows that loss of follow-up becomes a major problem for patients who had hernia repaired more than 3 months ago, and further quality of life surveys become illusive. To assess long-term results of hernia surgery, mailed questionnaires or mobile app to enhance the responsiveness may be conducted in future studies. Third, four questionnaire items (including one in the post-operative module) containing multiple-selection checkboxes were actually not addressed in the current study. Multiple-selection checkbox design did provide an efficient way to gather the maximum amount of information with limited questionnaire length. Future studies could take advantage of these assessments regarding recent co-morbidity (discomfort in the last week, Q10), conditions most affected by hernia (Q06), restricted activities due to hernia (Q07), and hernia repair complications (Q16).</p><p>We believe that our study developed a validated quality of life assessment tool to facilitate outcomes research for inguinal hernia and enhance the health care quality of hernia patients. The quantitative data gathered from the HERQL will provide invaluable evidence to reinforce resource allocations, preventive medicine, and even tailored approaches for personalized hernia repairs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Comparisons among hernia quality of life surveys.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Candidate items from literature reviews and the corresponding HERQL items and domains.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Fit statistics of models with different variance-covariance structures.</title><p>Fit statistics: -2 restricted log likelihood score (-2RLL), Akaike information criterion (AIC), finite-population corrected Akaike information criterion (AICC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC); smaller is better for AIC, AICC, and BIC.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>PROMAX-rotated factor loadings of the pilot study.</title><p>Q01: pain at rest, Q02: hernia protrusion, Q03: pain from mild activity, Q04: pain from moderate activity, Q05: pain from heavy activity, Q08: analgesic usage, Q09: activity restriction, Q11: hernia&#x02019;s impact on health, Q12: economic burden, Q13: quality of life/global health.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s005"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Pilot study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s006"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary methods.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s007"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>The HERQL questionnaire.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s008"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Covariance matrix in excel dataset formats.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s008.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183138.s009"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Covariance matrix in SAS dataset formats.</title><p>(SAS7BDAT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183138.s009.sas7bdat"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank members of Taiwan Hernia Society, including Dr. Cheng-Chung Tsai, Dr. Yao-Chou Tsai, Dr. Chin-Hung Tsai, and Dr. Chi-Chuan Yeh, for their contributions during expert panel discussion.
