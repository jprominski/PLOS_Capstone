numbers of presences and frequencies (proportions) of occurrences of species in a plot data set of forest vegetation on the species response curves and their niche attributes, based on Huisman-Olff-Fresco models (HOF). We modeled responses of 72 to 105 herbaceous forest species along a pH gradient under 14 different random sampling scenarios by varying the number of presences and absences used for model fitting. Mean niche attributes were calculated from 100 repetitive runs for each scenario and species. Re-prediction success of HOF models among the repetitive runs was highest when the total number of plots was high and the frequency of occurrences was low. With low plot numbers and high frequencies, less complicated model types (no response or monotonically increasing/decreasing responses) predominate. Measures of species niche boundaries (limits &#x00026; borders) and niche width were strongly influenced by changes in sampling characteristics. With an increasing number of presences and an increasing frequency, limits and borders shifted to more extreme values, leading to wider niches. In contrast, species optima showed almost no change between the scenarios. Thus, the detected ecological response of a species often depends on the size of the data set and the relation between presences and absences of a species. In general, high data quantities are required for reliable response curve modeling with HOF models, which prevents the assessment of the responses of many rare species. To avoid undesired bias by differing sampling characteristics when comparing niches between different species or between data sets, the data basis used for model fitting should be adjusted according to the niche attribute in question, for example by keeping the frequency of the species constant.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Both authors (JM, MD) were employed at the University of Bremen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uni-bremen.de/en.html">http://www.uni-bremen.de/en.html</ext-link>), but did not receive any special funding for this project.

Analyzing the shape of the response curves is necessary to advance ecological theory [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and also of practical interest, because some widely used ordination techniques (such as correspondence analysis, CA) are based on the assumption of symmetrical responses [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hence, information about the species responses along gradients is the basis for numerical community analysis and has important implications for continuum theory [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, the shape also determines model attributes, such as optima or niche limits, which can further be used to describe the ecological behavior of species in a simplified manner.</p><p>Various methods are available to examine species responses. For example, Gaussian logistic regression, as a special case of generalized linear models (GLMs), allows the modeling of symmetric bell-shaped response curves, which can be used to calculate numerical summaries of the species niche, e.g. the ecological optimum [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Gaussian logistic regression has been shown to be a robust technique [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183152.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but the assumption of an unimodal symmetric shape of the niche has sometimes been heavily criticized [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Generalized additive models (GAMs) are more flexible in their model shape, but also more difficult to apply and interpret, due to problems with smoother selection and over-fitting [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183152.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models provide a reasonable compromise between statistical correctness, flexibility and ecological interpretability for modeling species responses. They have first been introduced by Huisman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as a set of five hierarchical models with an increasing complexity, which were in accordance with ecological theory about species response patterns along gradients. The original paper distinguished the types: no response, increasing or decreasing response with or without plateau as well as skewed and non-skewed unimodal responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183152.g001">Fig 1A&#x02013;1D</xref>). The original model set-up was implemented as package &#x0201c;gravy&#x0201d; in the R statistical environment by Oksanen and Minchin [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This model framework has recently been expanded by Jansen and Oksanen [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to encompass seven ecological niche patterns, being implemented as the new R package &#x0201c;eHOF&#x0201d;. Apart from the five model types previously mentioned, two bimodal (skewed and symmetric) response shapes were included to cope with species that are restricted to gradient extremes due to competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183152.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref> and Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s001">S1 File</xref>). Although HOF models can take several different shapes, the niche parameters can easily be calculated and used for further analyses. In previous studies, HOF models have been shown to be superior to more restrictive methods (such as GLM or beta functions) and to perform well compared with GAMs that are more flexible [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183152.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0183152.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183152.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Examples of HOF models (types II-VII) showing the responses of species along a pH gradient.</title><p>A species with model type I shows no response along the gradient (b shows <italic>Chrysosplenium alternifolium)</italic>.

While the main application was to model the responses of single species [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], HOF models were also used to analyze changes in species richness [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], species cover [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or species turnover [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] along different types of gradients. The attributes of the response curve analyzed most often were the shape (in 97% of studies), followed by different kinds of niche boundary measures (limits, borders, thresholds, tolerances; 35%) and the species optimum (32%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s007">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>Despite the frequent use of HOF models, a basic problem of their application is that plot data on species occurrences in combination with environmental measurements in these plots is limited, mainly because the measurement of most environmental factors is time- and cost-intensive. In addition, many species have a low frequency (proportion of presences out of the total number of plots) in data sets even if the overall available number of plots is high, simply because species are often rare in nature for various reasons. Data paucity is of concern, because model fit, results and comparability are influenced by the size and composition of the data set used for modeling. It has been shown that the results of Gaussian logistic regression and of other modeling approaches (incl. GAMs) are heavily affected by the species frequency in the data set and the overall number of data points [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183152.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, only 53% of all studies that have used HOF models over the last six years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s007">S1 Table</xref>) report the frequencies or the exact number of data points available for each modelled species. Among those, the variability in size and features of the data sets from which models were built is very high: the number of plots varied between 26 and 2691 (median = 207), the minimum number of required species presences ranged from three to 40 (median = 10) and the minimum frequency was within the range of 0.004 to 0.432 (median = 0.04). Moreover, model procedures and evaluations are usually not described in much detail. Thus, it is likely that HOF models are often applied to the data with default package settings and without any prior data adjustment, model stability evaluation or model repetitions. Jansen and Oksanen [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] stated that re-prediction of a unimodal shape works excellent with the &#x0201c;eHOF&#x0201d; package and the stability checks implemented therein, but only if sufficient plot data with an even distribution along the gradient in question is available. Their tests are in line with a suggestion made by Coudun and G&#x000e9;gout [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for Gaussian logistic regression to use at least 50 occurrences to obtain reliable results. Unfortunately, this pre-condition leads to the exclusion of many less common species from studies, which is why it is rarely followed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s007">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, the only recent study taking into account the potential bias in HOF modeling was done by Reinecke et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who used an extensive procedure to overcome the problems caused by varying numbers of plots, varying frequencies of species in different regions and uneven sampling along the gradient. In addition, they fitted 50 models, based on random subsets of their data, created an average curve and derived their niche parameters from this average curve, instead of using the parameters provided by the &#x0201c;eHOF&#x0201d; package directly. But their approach still does not take into account between-species differences in data availability, which might lead to differences in model parameters irrespective of the underlying niche features, and thus to biased ecological interpretations.</p><p>Given the influence of data paucity and variability on the results of other modeling approaches, we suspect HOF models to be affected by these factors too. This in turn is likely to bias the results, especially if different studies are to be compared or if data sets contain common and rare species at the same time, which is usually the case.

However, the impact and effect size of changes in species frequency and presence differed between the niche attributes derived from the models. Thus, it is obvious that HOF model results cannot simply be compared between rare and common species, differing in presence and frequency, or between data sets of different size. To assess the extent of this possible bias and propose a solution, it is necessary to examine each model parameter separately.</p><p>Most previous studies using HOF models analyzed the shape of the species response curve along the gradient, i.e. the model type. The re-prediction success in model types was very low. Even for the&#x02014;in terms of the total number of plots&#x02014;largest data scenario (Pre100:Fre0.116) the mean Index of Variation across species was still 0.4 (for a visual impression of this issue see the animations in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s005">S5</xref> Files). This result, however, overestimates the actual differences between the curves, because the IQV takes the different model types as being completely different categories. Visual inspection of the curves revealed that these, in many cases, differed only slightly, although different model types were chosen: bimodal models with an extremely flat second hump, for example, are very similar to unimodal curves. These results confirm the findings by Jansen and Oksanen [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that re-prediction rates rapidly decrease in small data sets and with uneven sampling distribution. Mohler [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggested to sample more extensively at the gradient extremes to increase prediction success in Gaussian regression, and thus to intentionally use an unbalanced data set. In the present data set, the acidic extreme of the gradient was sampled intensively, while the more base-rich part of the gradient was sampled less well. Despite the high sampling intensity at low pH, curve shape and also lower limits and lower central borders varied strongly. When models are fitted with few data points or high frequencies, usually curves of type I to III are selected. Models that are more complicated can only be found with a high total number of plots in combination with low frequencies. This result is expectable, because the AICc penalizes, apart from the addition of parameters to the model, small sample size. Using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) instead, adds an even stronger penalty for small sample size, which results in a stronger restriction in model choice and in the selection of simple models in all data scenarios (data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s006">S6 File</xref>). This further adds to the observation that results obtained with small data sets are not reliable. In general, accuracy of response or distribution models usually improves with additional information, but plateaus exist [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The most rapid improvement of model accuracy in logistic regression was found to take place in scenarios with less than 20 presence points in the study by Stockwell and Peterson [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We also found an increased variety in the frequency distribution of model types between ten and 25 presences in the present data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183152.g002">Fig 2</xref>), but the within repetition variation, i.e. the IQV, did not improve much. Hence, our results support the findings that a minimum of 50 occurrences is necessary to obtain reliable re-prediction results and maximal model accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183152.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, our results suggest that a low frequency of occurrence in the data set is important as well. In general, a high re-prediction success of curve shapes (or model types) can be achieved only with a high total number of plots, which are evenly distributed along the whole gradient, and free choice of the model types by a low frequency of the single species in this data set, regardless of which IC is used. In case between-species differences are to be compared, the frequency should be kept constant for all species, regardless of their natural occurrence rates.</p><p>The optima<sub>all</sub> of species were less influenced by differing numbers of presences or frequencies than all other niche attributes. Although significant differences between the scenarios were found, the actual effect sizes were very small. For example, differences of up to 0.1 pH units are within the range of variation that can be expected when combining data from different sources, with samples being measured in different labs or solvents. Thus, we do not see the need for any data manipulation when considering optima, neither regarding number of presences nor regarding frequency.</p><p>The fixed 0.05 limits<sub>any</sub> were very sensitive to changes in the number of presences and in frequency. An increase in the number of presences led to a shift to more extreme values on the left- and right-hand side of the gradient, respectively, and to fewer species having their limits within the gradient range. An increase in frequency, in general, resulted in more extreme limits and a high chance for the response curve to no longer cross the 0.05 line. However, it also caused a strong clustering of limits at a certain pH level, which induces a shift to less extreme limits for some species, causing weaker correlations between the scenarios and making the effects of data differences on single species less predictable. The clustering was probably caused by the fact that, in high frequency scenarios, most species showed responses of type I&#x02013;III with a very high probability of occurrence along the gradient and very steep slopes towards the gradient ends. To be able to compare fixed limits between species or data sets, we therefore suggest to use low frequencies or to enlarge the gradient by additional sampling to allow for smooth slopes, variation of limit positions and to avoid clustering. Moreover, it is necessary to keep both presence numbers and frequency constant.</p><p>The central borders<sub>any</sub> were somewhat less influenced by manipulations of the data set than the limits. They also shifted to more extreme values with increasing number of presences and frequency, and suffered from the same clustering effect. The niche width suffered from the shift of the lower central borders to more acidic conditions and from the shift of upper borders to more base-rich conditions. This additive effect led to a high sensitivity of the niche width towards changes of presences and frequencies. Thus, we suggest applying occurrence data with a low frequency and keeping frequency and number of presences constant when comparing different species with each other or across data sets.</p><p>In the present study, curve parameters were derived by calculating mean parameter values from 100 repetitive model runs with random sampling. Optima<sub>any</sub> and limits<sub>any</sub> were heavily influenced by unexpected outlier curves, resulting in misleading optima or limit values. For example, it is likely that a species is not facing its limit within the gradient range when 99 curves give no limitand a limit is assigned in only one repetition. It thus seems to be more reasonable to use the optima<sub>51</sub> and limits<sub>51</sub>, but this reduced the present data set by up to 90% and led to similar results. An alternative approach is applied by Reinecke et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who created an average curve from repetitive runs and derived their parameters from it. In how far and to what extent these parameters are influenced by the number of presences and frequency remains to be tested.</p><p>Based on our results, it appears to be difficult to establish the "true" niche characteristics of species, because all model attributes, apart from the optimum, are heavily influenced by the properties of the data set. In practice, we believe that it is necessary to adjust a data set in terms of species presences and frequencies to compare niches between species or between different data sets, according to the above-mentioned criteria. Of course, this data manipulation has a strong impact on the results, i.e. the absolute values, but at least the effects then are consistent within the study. In general, a high number of presences combined with an overall low frequency seems to be the best option to obtain good results from HOF models. In the present data set, only 30% of the plant species met the conditions of having 50 occurrences or more, hence 70% of the species could not be modeled. These restrictions caused by data paucity are not unique to vegetation science, but can also be found in animals. For example, in Mexican bird populations, the median of available data points was 83 for all species with a heavy right skewed frequency distribution [<xref rid="pone.0183152.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The high requirements with respect to the properties of the data set for successfully modeling species response curves and the fact that few species meet these requirements, even in big data collections, stress the need for continued plot-based sampling of species and associated environmental data, and for further effort to make existing data accessible to the scientific community. Moreover, detailed information on the data used for response modeling should be given in future studies in order to enable comparisons across data sets and for meta-analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>HOF model formulas and distribution of pH measurements along the gradient.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Figures of niche parameters that are not given in the article.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Description for appendices <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s004">S4 File</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183152.s005">S5 File</xref>.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Animation of HOF models with increasing presence numbers.</title><p>(GIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s004.gif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Animation of HOF models with increasing frequency.</title><p>(GIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s005.gif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s006"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Comparison between AIC, AICc and BIC for model selection</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s007"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Literature survey.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s008"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Species data: Original data attributes and meta data of Pre:Fre scenarios.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s008.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s009"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Results of (generalized) linear mixed models.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s009.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183152.s010"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Vegetation data used for modelling.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183152.s010.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0183152.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Austin</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name>. <article-title>A silent clash of paradigms: some inconsistencies in community ecology</article-title>. <source>Oikos</source>. <year>1999</year>:<fpage>170</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>8</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0183152.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>ter Braak</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>J.</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name>
