They are associated with mutations and/or haplo-insufficiencies of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and inefficient ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing. The resulting ribosomal stress induces the canonical p19<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup>/Mdm2/p53 tumor suppressor pathway leading to proliferative arrest and/or apoptosis. It has been proposed that this pathway is then inactivated during subsequent neoplastic evolution. We show here that two murine models of hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) unexpectedly possess features that mimic the ribosomopathies. These include loss of the normal stoichiometry of RP transcripts and proteins and the accumulation of unprocessed rRNA precursors. Silencing of p19<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup>, cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, binding to and inactivation of Mdm2 by free RPs, and up-regulation of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 may further cooperate to drive tumor growth and survival. Consistent with this notion, re-instatement of constitutive p19<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> expression in the HB model completely suppressed tumorigenesis. In &#x0003e;2000 cases of human HCC, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, RP transcript deregulation was a frequent finding. In HCC and breast cancer, the severity of this dysregulation was associated with inferior survival. In HCC, the presence of RP gene mutations, some of which were identical to those previously reported in ribosomopathies, were similarly negatively correlated with long-term survival. Taken together, our results indicate that many if not all cancers possess ribosomopathy-like features that may affect their biological behaviors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>NIH</institution></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA174713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prochownik</surname><given-names>Edward V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>NIH</institution></funding-source><award-id>RO1 LM0712087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benos</surname><given-names>Panayiotis V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute</institution></funding-source><award-id>P30CA047904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prochownik</surname><given-names>Edward V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work supported by National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nih.gov/">https://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>) grant RO1 CA174713 to EVP and by the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute&#x02019;s (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://upci.upmc.edu/">http://upci.upmc.edu/</ext-link>) Cancer Biomarkers Facility, which is supported in part by award P30CA047904.

Most ribosomopathies such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), Schwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) and dyskeratosis congenital [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] are inherited conditions that are also variably associated with extra-hematopoietic defects including skeletal malformations, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and growth and cognitive impairment [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An acquired ribosomopathy, the 5q- syndrome, is associated with myelofibrosis and evolution to acute myelogenous leukemia in ~10% of cases [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Some pediatric T-cell leukemias and certain solid tumors, are also now thought to be acquired ribosomopathies [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although originally considered as distinct clinical entities, the ribosomopathies are related by virtue of their association with hemizygous mutations in ribosomal protein genes leading to RP haplo-insufficiency or malfunction [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For example, DBA mutations involve haploinsufficiency or mutation in one of at least 11 of the ~80 RPs comprising the 40S or 60S ribosomal subunits, most notably RPS19, RPS24, RPS26, RPL5 and RPL11 [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, SBDS involves mutations in the SBDS protein, which is believed to promote and/or stabilize the 40S and 60s ribosomal subunit interaction [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The minimal chromosomal region deleted in the 5q- abnormality, involving the band 5q33.1, includes the <italic>RPS14</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Ribosomopathy-associated bone marrow failure has been attributed to ribosome assembly defects arising as a consequence of altered RP stoichiometry and leading to defective rRNA processing, ribosomal stress and p53-dependent growth arrest and/or apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Precisely how this predisposes to cancer remains speculative although it presumably involves circumventing or disabling this potent tumor suppressor pathway [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, with the exception of the scattered reports mentioned above, the role of RP transcript and/or protein dysregulation in other human and murine cancers has not been studied.</p><p>In the current work, we utilized two mouse models of liver cancer in which the over-expression of mutant forms of &#x003b2;-catenin and <underline>y</underline>es-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>rotein [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or the oncoprotein c-Myc (Myc), recapitulate pediatric hepatoblastoma (HB) [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As expected for such rapidly growing tumors, and as previously described for transient Myc over-expression in the liver, virtually all transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were up-regulated in these tumors [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, in comparison to normal hepatocytes or livers, the <underline>relative</underline> levels of expression for many RP transcripts were deregulated. This was accompanied by distinct alterations in the RP expression patterns of each tumor type, by the accumulation of rRNA precursors and by several defects in the p19<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup>/Mdm2/p53 pathway, most notably a marked reduction in p19<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> expression. The reinstatement of p19<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> expression completely abrogated <italic>de novo</italic> HB tumorigenesis thereby mechanistically linking this tumor suppressor pathway with those regulated by &#x003b2;-catenin and YAP. In four human cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), comprising 2260 individuals, RP transcript deregulation was observed in virtually all tumors when compared to their corresponding normal tissues. Moreover, 5.2%&#x02013;14.3% of these cancer cases contained mutations in one or more RPs. Breast cancers and HCCs with the greatest degree of RP transcript deregulation and HCCs with RP mutations also demonstrated an overall inferior long-term survival. Thus, even more so than in &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; ribosomopathies, experimental murine and naturally occurring human cancers demonstrate profound dysregulation of multiple RP transcripts that undoubtedly evoke ribosomal stress and may impact disease pathogenesis and survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

For HBs, the total number of reads for these 85 RP transcripts within each group of samples (four sets of WT hepatocytes, five sets of KO hepatocytes and five sets each of WT and KO tumors) was arbitrarily set at 100%. The average percent contribution of each RP transcript to the total RP transcript pool in each of the groups was then calculated and displayed as a heat map. Replicates within the WT hepatocyte and WT tumor groups were compared using two-sided t-tests assuming unequal variance to determine which RP transcripts were significantly dysregulated in tumors compared to normal hepatocytes. P-values were adjusted assuming a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% and transcripts with resulting q-values less than the FDR were designated on the heat map with an asterisk (*).

Importantly, only minimal deregulation of RP transcripts occurred in livers following brief (3 day or 7 day) induction of Myc, which was well before HCC tumors developed.

Thus, maximal RP transcript deregulation appears to require both the continuous over-expression of growth-promoting stimuli such as &#x003b2;-catenin + YAP in HBs or Myc in HCCs and, at least in the latter case, a tumor environment.</p><p>We also examined by immuno-blotting the expression of several RPs, the choice of which was dictated by a combination of previously described associations with ribosomopathies and/or the notable dysregulation of their transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182705.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At least two of these RPs, RPS24 and RPS26, were expressed at lower levels in most HBs than in livers, particularly in the case of KO tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182705.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). KO livers also expressed higher levels of RPS24 than WT livers. Several additional RPs, notably RPS19 and RPS27, were sporadically over- or under-expressed in WT and/or KO tumors. Thus, in addition to RP transcripts, multiple RPs also appear to be deregulated. In comparison to HCCs where Myc is the inciting oncogenic insult, Myc&#x02019;s dispensability for RP transcript discordancy in HBs may at least partly reflect the Myc-independent pathways of &#x003b2;-catenin and YAP signaling that also govern RP transcript expression [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>HCCs also showed a loss of coordinated RP expression albeit with a pattern distinct from that seen with HBs. Most RPs, such as RPS24, RPS27 and RPL30, were up-regulated in initial tumors whereas RPS19, RPS26 and RPL11 either remained unchanged or even decreased in HCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182705.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and Figure C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182705.s001">S1 File</xref>). Moreover, discordancy between <italic>Rps24</italic> and <italic>Rps27</italic> transcripts were seen in some initial and recurrent tumors. Finally, the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of individual proteins varied considerably. Changes in the levels of several RPs such as RPS10, RPS19 and RPL30 were detectable as early as 3 days after Myc induction and well before deregulation of their transcripts could be detected. Thus, similar to RP transcripts, individual RP protein levels in HCCs do not change uniformly or coordinately during the course of tumor evolution, regression and recurrence with respect to one another. However, the overall pattern of these changes does appear to be consistent among individual tumors and indicates a marked change in RP stoichiometries relative to those found in normal liver.</p><p>Efficient ribosomal biogenesis requires the highly coordinated processing and assembly of rRNAs as well as RPs [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA are transcribed from a single primary transcript 47S, that is cleaved and processed to progressively smaller precursors [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

For each of the &#x0003e;40,000 genes listed in the tumor mutation databases, Chi-squared tests were performed to determine if the frequencies of non-RP gene mutations differed between the two tumor groups.

In breast, liver, and prostate cancer, none of these subsequent Chi-squared tests were significant after Bonferroni false-discovery (FDR) correction. Thus, while RP mutant tumors were more likely to possess mutations in other genes as noted above, no specific gene(s) appeared to be favored.</p><p>In contrast, 42 genes were mutated in RP mutant CRCs at a higher frequency than expected (35&#x02013;70% of RP mutant tumors versus 1%-32% in non-RP mutant tumors) (P &#x0003c; 0.05 after FDR-correction).

On the other hand, these same tumors also showed similarly elevated levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Taken together, these results suggest that, in the case of both HBs and HCCs, any apoptotic predisposition is mitigated at the nuclear level by p53&#x02019;s inability to transcriptionally activate cell death-related genes and at the mitochondrial level by the up-regulation of Bcl-2, which interferes with Bax-mediated loss of mitochondrial integrity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Discussion</title><p>The number and heterogeneity of RP abnormalities described here currently preclude a precise determination as to how any individual RP contributes to cancer pathogenesis.

The deregulation of oncoproteins such as Myc and Bcl-2 and tumor suppressors such as p53 might also contribute to RP abnormalities during tumor evolution with the relative importance of these factors being further dictated by both tissue and tumor heterogeneity [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. What is clear however, is that, regardless of the underlying cause(s) of RP transcript and RP de-regulation, the consequences involve many of the same mechanisms and pathways that have been previously described in the ribosomopathies, where they are thought to underlie disease pathogenesis and cancer susceptibility [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These include a massive and much more pronounced deregulation of RP transcripts and proteins than occurs in classical ribosomopathies and a ribosomopathy-like maturation defect in rRNA processing in both of the animal models we have studied. It also seems likely that RP deregulation and the direct binding of numerous free RPs to Mdm2 precludes the latter protein&#x02019;s interaction with and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53.</p><p>Despite these similarities, a major difference between the cancers discussed here and classical ribosomopathies is that the latter disorders are believed to be associated with p53-mediated bone marrow suppression [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The fact that p53 remains detectable and non-mutated in HBs and HCCs without exerting any apparent growth inhibitory effects is likely attributable to a combination of its cytoplasmic localization and the additional protective effect of Bcl-2 up-regulation, despite an equally high concurrent up-regulation of Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182705.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). The combination of high-level Myc (or N-Myc) and Bcl2 expression has been previously shown to prevent the nuclear translocation of otherwise wild-type p53 in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, the otherwise pro-apoptotic effect of increased Bax expression in both HBs and HCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182705.g005">Fig 5F</xref>) may be mitigated by the fact that these tumors, as well as their corresponding normal livers, express undetectable or barely detectable levels of caspase 2 (not shown), which is necessary for the execution of Bax-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>In the era prior to the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, Dameshek first remarked upon the seemingly paradoxical relationship between hypoplastic hematopoietic disorders and susceptibility to leukemia [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Appropriating a term from bacterial genetics, he proposed that surviving hematopoietic cells might acquire clonal &#x0201c;suppressor&#x0201d; mutations, which allow them to overcome their intrinsic proliferative block and become transformed. The results with two murine cancer models described here have identified some of these potential suppressors and provide mechanistic insights into how the tendency toward cell cycle arrest and apoptosis arising from ribosomal stress can be circumvented.

Given the heterogeneity of RP and transcript deregulation in both classical ribosomopathies and sporadic human cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182705.g003">Fig 3</xref>), it seems likely that other compensatory mutations exist, including those involving p53 and p19<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> inactivation and Mdm2 over-expression.</p><p>In summary, experimentally generated murine HBs and HCCs are associated with frequent and heretofore unrecognized RP transcript and protein deregulation. Similar findings regarding RP transcripts were made in four common human cancer types with the severity of transcript deregulation and/or the presence of mutations correlating inversely with survival in two of the three cohorts in which such analysis was possible. Although rare, some human cancer-associated RP point mutations were identical to those previously described in ribosomopathies, thus implying a causal contribution. It remains to be determined how many of the remaining mutations, not previously identified in ribosomopathies, have functional consequences given that they do not appear to represent polymorphisms [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>As is also common in ribosomopathies, defective rRNA processing was observed in our murine tumor models. Compensatory mechanisms to evade growth inhibitory signals arising from the ensuing ribosomal stress center around p19<sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> silencing, the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, and the induction of Bcl-2. Ribosomopathies, originally identified as rare, mostly inborn disorders of hematopoiesis and development [<xref rid="pone.0182705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182705.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], now appear to include many human cancers with implications that remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182705.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>Supporting information for Materials and methods, Figures A-P and legends and Tables A-H and legends.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182705.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. John Woolford and Dr. Adrian Lee for their comments on the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0182705.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ruggero</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shimamura</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Marrow failure: a window into ribosome biology</article-title>. <source>Blood</source>. <year>2014</year>;<volume>124</volume>(<issue>18</issue>):<fpage>2784</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>92</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2014-04-526301">10.1182/blood-2014-04-526301</ext-link></comment> ; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC4215310.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25237201</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0182705.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Yelick</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Trainor</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Ribosomopathies: Global process, tissue specific defects</article-title>. <source>Rare Diseases</source>. <year>2015</year>;<volume>3</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>e1025185</fpage>
