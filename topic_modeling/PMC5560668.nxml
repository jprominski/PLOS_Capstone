Here we provide evidence for a specific, discrete, well-defined glycan modification and regulation of a stage-specific cell migration in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We show that a chain-terminating, putative null mutation in the gene encoding a predicted &#x003b2;1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, named <italic>ngat-1</italic>, causes a maternally rescued temperature sensitive (ts) defect in the second phase of the three phase migration pattern of the posterior, but not the anterior, hermaphrodite Distal Tip Cell (DTC). An amino-terminal partial deletion of <italic>ngat-1</italic> causes a similar but lower penetrance ts phenotype. The existence of multiple ts alleles with distinctly different molecular DNA lesions, neither of which is likely to encode a ts protein, indicates that NGAT-1 normally prevents innate temperature sensitivity for phase 2 DTC pathfinding. Temperature shift analyses indicate that the ts period for the <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutant defect ends by the beginning of post-embryonic development&#x02013;nearly 3 full larval stages prior to the defective phase 2 migration affected by <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutations. NGAT-1 homologs generate glycan-terminal GalNAc-&#x003b2;1-4GlcNAc, referred to as LacdiNAc modifications, on glycoproteins and glycolipids. We also found that the absence of the GnT1/Mgat1 activity [UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:&#x003b1;-3-D-mannoside &#x003b2;-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (encoded by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans gly-12</italic>, <italic>gly-13</italic>, and <italic>gly-14</italic> and homologous to vertebrate GnT1/Mgat1)], causes a similar spectrum of DTC phenotypes as <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutations&#x02013;primarily affecting posterior DTC phase 2 migration and preventing manifestation of the same innate ts period as <italic>ngat-1</italic>. GnT1/Mgat1 is a medial Golgi enzyme known to modify mannose residues and initiate N-glycan branching, an essential step in the biosynthesis of hybrid, paucimannose and complex-type N-glycans. Quadruple mutant animals bearing putative null mutations in <italic>ngat-1</italic> and the three GnT genes (<italic>gly-12</italic>, <italic>gly-13</italic>, <italic>gly-14</italic>) were not enhanced for DTC migration defects, suggesting NGAT-1 and GnT1 act in the same pathway. These findings suggest that GnTI generates an N-glycan substrate for NGAT-1 modification, which is required at restrictive temperature (25&#x000b0;C) to prevent, stabilize, reverse or compensate a perinatal thermo-labile process (or structure) causing late larval stage DTC phase 2 migration errors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2016-06644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veyhl</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP119505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6325-4612</contrib-id><name><surname>Culotti</surname><given-names>Joseph G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-62975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dennis</surname><given-names>James W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-77722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6325-4612</contrib-id><name><surname>Culotti</surname><given-names>Joseph G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering and Research Council of Canada, Grant number RGPIN-20160o6644 UT to JGC (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/onlineservices-servicesenligne/index_eng.asp">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/onlineservices-servicesenligne/index_eng.asp</ext-link>); and Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Grant number MOP 77722 to JGC (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html">http://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="27"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are in the paper and its Supporting Information files.

In the past, we discovered that mutants of UNC-6/Netrin signaling affect both axon guidance and the migration of two cells in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> called distal tip cells (DTCs). These cells migrate at the leading distal tip of each of the two independently extending hermaphrodite gonad arms to shape these arms during post-embryonic development [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The DTCs are born post-embryonically in the ventral mid-body and migrate in 3 phases (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183049.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>): (1) longitudinally in opposite directions away from the mid-body&#x02014;the anterior DTC along the right and the posterior DTC along the left ventral body wall muscles (BWMs), then (2) from ventral to dorsal BWMs across the lateral epidermis on the same side as the phase 1 migration, then (3) back to the mid-body along dorsal BWMs. The migratory path of the DTCs determines the final shape of the adult gonad arms, thus in the wild type the gonad arms are each U-shaped and mirror image when the trajectory is viewed from a lateral perspective. In the studies reported here, the DTC migration paths were deduced from the shape of the hermaphrodite gonad arms in 4<sup>th</sup> larval stage (L4) animals and young adults (as in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183049.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="pone.0183049.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183049.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Common posterior Distal Tip Cell (DTC) trajectories in <italic>ngat-1(ev821)</italic> mutant animals.</title><p>Lateral view of the posterior gonad arm in L4 hermaphrodite animals by D.I.C. microscopy.

In netrin signalling mutants (<italic>unc-5</italic>, <italic>unc-6</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> mutants) and the mutant subjects of this report, the phase 2 migration frequently fails to execute, nevertheless, the DTCs, stuck on the ventral side, move back to the mid-body along the ventral BWMs with proper phase 3 timing. This phase 2 migration failure causes a ventrally reflexed gonad arm in which the distal portion of the arm comes to lie beside the proximal portion of the same arm (as in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183049.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). The side-by-side proximal and distal portions on the ventral side push the opaque intestine dorsally, creating a ventral clear patch (VCP) visible by low power stereo-microscopy in pre-adults (L4 stage larvae) and adults [see [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]]. Other kinds of DTC navigation errors cause smaller regions of gonad arms to lay side-by-side which manifest as smaller clear patches (as in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183049.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). We crudely categorized VCPs as full (as in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183049.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>), near-full (full, but with a small opaque interruption), and partial (as in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183049.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>), depending on the number and extent of the clear patch(es) associated with each gonad arm. Clear patches therefore greatly facilitate scoring of a variety of DTC navigation errors.</p><p>The UNC-6/Netrin guidance system represents an important mechanism involving physical interaction and molecular cross-talk between DTCs and the extracellular matrix (ECM) during the course of migration. Further evidence for the importance of the ECM in DTC migration is that a variety of ECM molecules, their receptors, and enzymes that create or modify glycans present on ECM glycoproteins are known to affect DTC migration and in some cases also axon migration [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183049.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Anterior and posterior DTC phase 1 navigation defects were largely limited to gonad arms that migrated prematurely to the dorsal side during phase 1 (5 of 211 posterior DTCs and 5 of 199 anterior DTCs). Phase 3-specific navigation defects included distal gonad arms that returned to the ventral side following a normal phase 2 (see <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183049.g002">Fig 2<italic>v</italic></xref></bold>), reversed direction on the dorsal side (2 of 199 anterior DTCs), or much more frequently migrated to the opposite side of the animal (switched sides) before stopping or continuing to migrate toward mid-body on the dorsal side.

Changes in direction were usually accompanied by a bulbous protrusion in the girth of the gonad arm and occasional changes in sidedness of the DTC migration during phase 3. The migration back toward mid-body along the proximal gonad arm on the ventral side did not occur as frequently or to the same extent in the <italic>GnT1</italic> triple null mutant as in the <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutants (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183049.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>), thereby causing a lower penetrance (approximately 30%) of visible VCPs compared to the nearly 75% penetrance of VCPs in the <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutant animals. Furthermore, the phase 2 posterior DTC migration errors in <italic>GnT1</italic> triple null mutant animals grown at 25&#x000b0;C were more frequent (48 of 56) than those grown at 20&#x000b0;C (30 of 563), which were more frequent than those grown at 16&#x000b0;C (8 of 62) (Panel B in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183049.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>).

The <italic>ev821</italic> mutation was identified as such an enhancer, but when isolated away from the weak <italic>unc-40(ev543)</italic> allele was found to induce DTC migration defects on its own. We cloned the <italic>ev821</italic> mutant gene by one step SNP/WGS and the <italic>ev821</italic> mutation was found to create a premature stop codon in the ORF for a putative N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase encoding gene we named <italic>ngat-1</italic>. Many, but not all of the <italic>ngat-1(ev821)</italic> mutant DTC migration defects were phase 2 DTC migration failures, nearly half of which were similar to those previously observed in mutants of <italic>unc-5</italic>, <italic>unc-40</italic> and <italic>unc-6</italic>, while other phase 2 migration errors varied in migration pattern, including those that began migrating toward mid-body on the ventral BWMs then migrated to the dorsal BWMs before reaching mid-body. Other relatively infrequent defects in <italic>ev821</italic> mutant DTC migration included DTCs meandering along the D/V axis on the ventral side as they migrate back toward the mid-body during the equivalent of phases 2 and 3 of migration. The DTC migration defects in <italic>ngat-1(ev821)</italic> (and <italic>GnT1</italic>/Mgat1 triple) mutants differ in several additional ways from the netrin mutant DTC migration defects. First, they appear to affect primarily posterior DTC migration and have few effects on anterior migration. This is somewhat unexpected, except that for unknown reasons, even in <italic>unc-5</italic>, <italic>unc-6</italic> and <italic>unc-40</italic> mutants the phase 2 navigational errors of the posterior DTC are more penetrant than the anterior DTC. However, anterior DTC migrations in the <italic>ngat-1</italic> and <italic>GnT1</italic> mutants might simply fall below some threshold for ventral to dorsal migration activity that is not present in the posterior DTC and not encountered in the netrin mutants. This seems unlikely, however, because one would have expected that any effect of <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutation on the phase 2 anterior DTC migration would have manifested in a genetic background sensitized by the absence of <italic>unc-6</italic> function, yet <italic>ngat-1(ev821)</italic> failed to enhance the anterior DTC defects (VCPs) of the <italic>unc-6(ev400)</italic> mutant. This suggests that <italic>ngat-1</italic>, unlike <italic>unc-6</italic>, has little if any role in anterior DTC migration (or is redundant with another unknown gene) and its function largely in posterior DTC migration may begin to account for known differences in the sensitivity of the two DTCs to mutations in other migration genes.</p><p>A second difference between the netrin mutants and <italic>ngat-1(ev821)</italic> is that the <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutant DTC migration defects are maternally rescued, that is, the homozygous mutant self-fertilization progeny of a heterozygous hermaphrodite parent rarely manifest phase 2 DTC navigation errors, whereas the self-fertilization progeny of these homozygotes do manifest a significant penetrance of these errors. Maternal rescue is known to occur for the majority of mutations in genes required for embryonic viability, which suggests that products of most maternally rescued genes are present when their function is needed during embryogenesis. Unlike most essential embryonic genes showing maternal rescue, the <italic>ngat-1(+)</italic> gene is required for a much later (post-embryonic) process leading to phase 2 DTC migration. A third difference between <italic>ev821</italic> and netrin mutants&#x02014;the severe temperature sensitivity of the former and not the latter (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183049.s008">S5 Table</xref></bold>)&#x02013;allowed us to estimate the developmental period in which subsequent phase 2 DTC migration is sensitive to temperature in the absence of NGAT-1 or, as we later showed, GnT1 function. Surprisingly, the ts period for <italic>ngat-1</italic> and <italic>GnT1</italic> mutants ends by the beginning of post-embryonic development or slightly thereafter in the first post-embryonic larval stage to allow a migration that occurs nearly 3 full larval stages later.</p><p>How can one reconcile the apparent early ts period with the late effect on DTC migration of missing NGAT-1 and GnT1 function? In principle, <italic>ngat-1(ev821)</italic> (and possibly one or more of the <italic>gly</italic> gene mutants) is temperature sensitive for synthesis of the corresponding gene product (which normally occurs during the ts period) or creates a ts NGAT-1 protein. However, the possibility of either of these scenarios for NGAT-1 or GnT1 is remote, given the high likelihood that both <italic>ngat-1(ev821)</italic> and the triple <italic>gly-14; gly-12 gly-13</italic> mutants are null for their respective NGAT-1 and GnT1 activities. This consideration suggests that NGAT-1 and GnT1 activities somehow prevent the innate temperature sensitivity of the phase 2 DTC migration, which has a ts period that ends by the L1 stage. NGAT-1 and GnT1 could do this by acting directly in a ts process or structure to prevent or reverse its thermolability (in which case the ts period could represent the period of NGAT-1 and GnT1 activity) or it could act in a separate process that bypasses or compensates for the ts deficiency in some other unknown way (in which case the ts period may not represent the time of NGAT-1 and GnT1 action). However, the great majority of maternally rescued genes with few exceptions [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] function during embryogenesis or perinatally, therefore it seems likely that NGAT-1 and GnT1 function during the innate ts period rather than closer to the time of the phase 2 migration they regulate. Distinguishing between these possibilities will require&#x02014;as a first step&#x02014;the identification and characterization of the target(s) of NGAT-1 and GnT1activity relevant to phase 2 DTC migration.</p><p>NGAT-1 and GnT1 are predicted by their enzymatic activity to modify one or more secreted glycoproteins. The ability of a <italic>lag-2</italic> promoter-driven <italic>ngat-1(+)</italic> construct to rescue mutant DTC migration defects suggests that a DTC-expressed glycoprotein can be modified by GnT1 and NGAT-1 to rescue the innate temperature sensitivity of the phase 2 DTC migration. The ability of body wall muscle (BWM) expressed NGAT-1 to rescue the <italic>ngat-1(ev821)</italic> DTC migration defects&#x02014;even though BWM is not the substratum for the phase 2 migration&#x02013;also suggests that a glycoconjugate target (possibly the same as the DTC-expressed target) of NGAT-1 activity can be secreted by BWMs to promote phase 2 migration at restrictive temperature, probably by incorporating into the gonad/DTC basement membrane. Precedent for this kind of autonomous and non-autonomous activity that promotes phase 2 DTC migration is found in MIG-17, which is made by body wall muscles and incorporates into the gonad basement membrane where it functions, but can also rescue a <italic>mig-17</italic> mutant DTC defects when expressed in the DTCs [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183049.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. An important caveat to the above interpretations is that <italic>lag-</italic>2 and <italic>myo-3</italic> reporters are not entirely specific to DTCs and muscle, respectively. For example, <italic>myo-3</italic> is also expressed by the gonad sheath cells [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which help create the gonad/DTC basement membrane, and may conceivably also be expressed below limits of detection in the DTCs and <italic>lag-2</italic> is expressed in the ventral nerve cord and vulval precursor cells in the L3 stage [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is possible (as occurs for <italic>mig-17</italic>) that non-autonomous rescue by BWM and perhaps other tissue-specific expression of NGAT-1 does occur and possible that cell autonomous rescue can also occur.</p><p>One of our immediate goals is to identify potential targets for LacdiNAc modification by NGAT-1 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and by related galactosyl transferases in mammals to begin to illuminate the <italic>ngat-1</italic> requirement for cell migration. When we started, we considered possible targets for NGAT-1 mediated glycosylation included N- or O- glycoproteins or glycolipids. The finding that <italic>gly-14;gly-12 gly-13</italic> triple mutant animals have DTC migration defects similar to those of <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutants (temperature-sensitive phase 2 errors largely limited to posterior DTCs with a similar early ts period) suggests that the migration-relevant NGAT-1 target(s) is the same N-glycoprotein(s) as the GnT1 target(s).

Mass spectrometry analysis may be required to confirm this possibility, which if true would suggest that it is not the absence of GnT1 derived core glycan structures <italic>per se</italic> that cause the phase 2 DTC migration defects, but more likely the absence of the terminal LacdiNAc modification dependent upon these core glycan structures that is largely, but not totally, responsible for these defects.</p><sec id="sec036"><title>The <italic>ngat-1</italic> null mutant DTC migration phenotype differs from other glycosylation- associated gene mutants</title><p>Other glycogene mutants affecting DTC migration like <italic>cogc-1</italic>, <italic>cogc-3</italic>, <italic>mig-22</italic> and <italic>mig-23</italic> are likely to cause severe but unpredictable alterations of glycan chains of many proteins.

The discovery of glycogene mutants with cell migration defects predicted to cause deficits in LacdiNAc modification of glycoproteins has an interesting parallel to reports that the LacdiNAc epitope in mammals plays a role in cancer progression and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, one of us (JWD) has reported previously that deficiencies in one or more vertebrate enzymes of the N-glycan branching pathway (comprising Mgat1/GnT1, alpha-mannosidase II/ManII, Mgat2, Mgat4, and Mgat5 activity&#x02014;see [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]) modifies tumor growth and reduces cell migration, invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183049.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>The predicted absence of a specific glyco-epitope (LacdiNAc) in <italic>ngat-1</italic> and <italic>Mgat1/GnT1</italic> (<italic>gly12</italic>, <italic>-13</italic>, <italic>-14</italic>) mutants that causes a specific cell migration defect and the existence of reagents that detect this epitope [<xref rid="pone.0183049.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183049.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] suggest it should be possible to biochemically identify the target(s) of NGAT-1 and GnT1 mediated glycosylation required for normal DTC phase 2 pathfinding, which are presumably present in both BWMs and DTCs as determined by cell type specific rescue experiments of the <italic>ngat-1</italic> mutant. The link between LacdiNAc modification and tumor progression further suggests that a genetic dissection of this mechanism in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and analysis of mammalian homologs of the relevant target genes identified in this genetic model could have translational potential. The maternal effect and later manifestation of a cell migration phenotype also suggests the possibility that NGAT-1 related enzymes in mammals might mediate a previously unrecognized perinatal function that contributes to later onset human health issues.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec038"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183049.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Temperature-sensitivity of mutant DTC phase 2 migration defects.</title><p>Bars indicate the penetrance of DTC phase 2 errors when grown &#x0003e;2 generations at the indicated temperature.
