In this study, we report the highly unusual peripheral circadian rhythm of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) induced by titanium-based biomaterials with complex surface modifications (Ti biomaterial) commonly used for dental and orthopedic implants. When cultured on Ti biomaterials, human BMSCs suppressed circadian <italic>PER1</italic> expression patterns, while <italic>NPAS2</italic> was uniquely upregulated. The Ti biomaterials, which reduced <italic>Per1</italic> expression and upregulated <italic>Npas2</italic>, were further examined with BMSCs harvested from <italic>Per1</italic>::<italic>luc</italic> transgenic rats. Next, we addressed the regulatory relationship between <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Npas2</italic> using BMSCs from <italic>Npas2</italic> knockout mice. The <italic>Npas2</italic> knockout mutation did not rescue the Ti biomaterial-induced <italic>Per1</italic> suppression and did not affect <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Per3</italic>, <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic> expression, suggesting that the Ti biomaterial-induced <italic>Npas2</italic> overexpression was likely an independent phenomenon. Previously, vitamin D deficiency was reported to interfere with Ti biomaterial osseointegration. The present study demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly increased <italic>Per1</italic>::<italic>luc</italic> expression in BMSCs, though the presence of Ti biomaterials only moderately affected the suppressed <italic>Per1</italic>::<italic>luc</italic> expression. Available <italic>in vivo</italic> microarray data from femurs exposed to Ti biomaterials in vitamin D-deficient rats were evaluated by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. A large co-expression network containing <italic>Npas2</italic>, <italic>Bmal1</italic>, and <italic>Vdr</italic> was observed to form with the Ti biomaterials, which was disintegrated by vitamin D deficiency. Thus, the aberrant BMSC peripheral circadian rhythm may be essential for the integration of Ti biomaterials into bone.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>UCLA Academic Senate</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3749-9445</contrib-id><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Biomet 3I/Zimmer Biomet</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3749-9445</contrib-id><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was, in part, supported by UCLA Academic Senate Faculty Research Grant and a research grant/in kind Ti biomaterials from Biomet 3I, Palm Beach Garden, FL.

The replacement of knee, hip and tooth structure and function by Ti implants may improve patient quality of life and longevity. Ti biomaterials exhibit suitable mechanical properties, such as high strength and a low Young&#x02019;s modulus [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], as well as excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity and minimal immunogenicity [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The therapeutic outcome of successful endosseous implants commonly achieved by direct bonding of regenerating bone to the surface of Ti biomaterials is also called osseointegration [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are believed to be primarily responsible for achieving osseointegration. The surface topography at the submicron to micron levels has been extensively investigated with respect to the modulatory effects of BMSCs to improve osseointegration [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. More recently, methods to create nanometer-scale topographies have been introduced, and the combination of micro/nano-scale topography has been shown to promote osseointegration [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Implant loosening due to osseointegration failures can occur during the early surgical wound healing stage or after the implant has been in function for some duration [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Once osseointegration is lost, therapeutic options are limited to surgically remove the implant. The increased financial burden of implant revision surgery has become a challenge in healthcare systems [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recent pre-clinical and clinical reports suggest that adequate serum vitamin D levels are a critical parameter for the therapeutic success of Ti implants [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A genome-wide microarray analysis of femur bone marrow tissue exposed to a Ti implant in rats with vitamin D deficiency revealed that the circadian rhythm pathway and, in particular, the expression of Neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2 (<italic>Npas2</italic>) was most significantly modulated during the Ti implant to bone integration period [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Circadian rhythms are generated by an internal clock localized in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and their disruption has been reported to cause a wide range of physiological, mental and behavioral disorders [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The SCN contains a collection of cell-autonomous oscillators that are regulated by intracellular feed-back and -forward loops involving the transcription of period circadian protein homolog (<italic>PER</italic>) and cryptochrome (<italic>CRY</italic>) genes that are activated by brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (<italic>BMAL1</italic>) and Circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (<italic>CLOCK</italic>) nuclear protein dimers [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition to the central circadian rhythm, peripheral tissues are also reported to possess an independent circadian regulatory mechanism to allow greater flexibility in adapting to local environments [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>This study examined the peripheral circadian rhythms of BMSCs in relation to Ti biomaterials and vitamin D supplementation.

BMSCs are the major cellular component in the bone marrow, which contains mesenchymal stem cells, and are capable of differentiating in multiple lineages and centrally coordinating bone remodeling and regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, how BMSCs respond to a wide range of environmental cues that occur during fracture wound healing, bone marrow ablation or surgical implant placement has not been fully investigated. This study demonstrated that the peripheral circadian rhythm of BMSCs was modulated by Ti biomaterials with complex surfaces at unprecedented levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183359.g001">Fig 1</xref>). BMSCs almost completely abrogated the circadian expression of <italic>Per1</italic>, particularly those cultured on Ti substrates with complex surface modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183359.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Increasing numbers of reports suggest that bone tissues possess an independent peripheral circadian clock mechanism. Chen et al. (2000) demonstrated for the first time the expression profile of <italic>Per</italic> genes in murine bone marrow in a lineage- and/or differentiation stage-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Zvonic et al. (2007) reported the oscillatory expression of the core circadian rhythm genes in the mouse calvarial bone, and further showed that over 20% of the genes expressed in the calvarial bone also followed the oscillatory profile [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Zhang et al. (2008) showed the E-box-related regulation of osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells by multiple Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) factors, such as <italic>Id-2</italic>, <italic>Id-3</italic> and <italic>Id-4</italic>, which can functionally regulate the expression of bone markers [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. McElderry et al. (2013) demonstrated a burst in active mineral deposition in calvarial organ culture followed by a decreased or quiescent phase with a periodicity of approximately 27 hours without central SCN control [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The significance of the present study lies in the demonstration that exogenous stimuli derived from commonly used Ti biomaterials with complex surfaces significantly disrupted the circadian rhythm. The therapeutic outcome of a successful endosseous implant is achieved, in part, by the osseointegration of Ti biomaterials as well as other materials, such as zirconia. We further investigated the circadian rhythm by examining gene expression on zirconia without surface modifications. Machined Ti discs and smooth surface zirconia discs induced similar circadian rhythm gene expression patterns, whereas the B-DAE-DCD discs showed robust <italic>Npas2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183359.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Therefore, the complex surface modifications, not the materials&#x02019; chemistry, may play a significant role in circadian rhythm modulation.</p><p>It has been shown that serum vitamin D deficiency may negatively affect the initial establishment of osseointegration [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The present study revealed the distinct effect of vitamin D supplementation on circadian Per1 expression in BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183359.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The intrinsic circadian clock is maintained by a network of core molecular components [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], as well as by increasing numbers of clock-modifying molecules [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The WGCNA evaluation of the whole genome microarray data identified large gene co-expression modules containing circadian rhythm transcription factors (Blue module) and repressor proteins (Turquoise module), both of which are sensitively associated with rat bone marrow tissue treatment traits for exposure to Ti biomaterials or serum vitamin D levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183359.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The hub genes in the Blue module suggested that the circadian rhythm core molecular components and steroid hormone nuclear receptors interacting protein networks include <italic>Vdr</italic>. When the gene network modules were further dissected into ITV+ and ITV-, the circadian rhythm gene network in the Blue module appeared to deteriorate under the vitamin D-deficient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183359.g006">Fig 6</xref>). <italic>Vdr</italic> has been identified as a circadian clock modifier in adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and vitamin D supplementation alone has been reported to synchronize adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The genomic and non-genomic actions of vitamin D on bHLH genes may explain the secondary effects on these genes, including fine tuning the circadian rhythms [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The present study further suggests that <italic>Vdr</italic> in BMSCs may play an essential role in organizing the Ti biomaterial-activated aberrant circadian rhythm.</p><p>It was reported that <italic>Npas2</italic> expression was not detected in bone but that its deletion did not affect bone mass [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Consistently, BMSCs in the present study showed only baseline expression of <italic>Npas2</italic> when cultured on conventional plates without Ti discs. Strikingly, this study identified an unusual upregulation of <italic>Npas2</italic> in BMSCs exposed to Ti biomaterials with complex surface topographies (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183359.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183359.g002">2</xref>). <italic>Npas2</italic> has overlapping functions with <italic>Clock</italic> and forms a heterodimer with <italic>Bmal1</italic>, which functions as an E-box binding enhancer for <italic>Per</italic> and <italic>Cry</italic> homologues [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] as well as for other genes that contain E-box elements, such as <italic>Id2</italic>, c-myc, collagens type I, II and X [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, the abnormally increased <italic>Npas2</italic> expression was initially thought to contribute to the aberrant circadian rhythm patterns observed in the BMSCs induced by Ti biomaterials with complex surfaces. However, examination of BMSCs from <italic>Npas2</italic> knockout mice did not support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183359.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous agents are involved in the response of clock molecules to different environmental cues [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], such as glucose feeding, light response, serum shock, and glucocorticoid and hormone exposure [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The surface of Ti biomaterials is spontaneously oxidized to form a native layer of TiO<sub>2</sub>, which may represent an environmental cue for bone cell plasticity. Surface treatments, such as acid etching [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and hydroxyapatite nanocoatings [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], significantly alter the surface oxide layer. Recently, thermal oxidation of Ti biomaterials was reported to increase the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface layer, resulting in increased biological activity [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The interaction between the endogenous molecule heme and TiO<sub>2</sub> has been described [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It has also been reported that <italic>Npas2</italic>, which contains heme prosthetic groups, functions as a gas-sensor [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Mutation of the heme domain and its conformation changes reduce <italic>Per1</italic> transcription because the mutational and conformational changes impair <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Npas2</italic> heterodimer formation, resulting in a loss of DNA binding to the canonical E-box regulatory sequence in various target genes [<xref rid="pone.0183359.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183359.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that <italic>Npas2</italic> upregulation in BMSCs might be induced by the oxidation levels on the surface of the Ti biomaterials, which may initiate titanium actions at the local bone site by activating gas-sensor or heme metabolism pathways.</p><p>In conclusion, this study postulates that the significant degree of aberrant plasticity demonstrated by the peripheral circadian clock of BMSCs exposed to Ti biomaterials may provide the ability to integrate environmental clues and therefore to coordinate a coherent biological output. The data in this study corroborate previous <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> findings (Mengatto et al., 2011) and highlight the increase in <italic>Npas2</italic> and <italic>Per1</italic> abrogation as independent key factors for osseointegration. These results have potential practical implications related to orthopedic and dental implant patients, as understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms during early titanium implant osseointegration allows for the development of better biomarkers to follow up healing cellular processes. This approach also enables the therapeutic conditioning of local bone or systemic situations to achieve faster and more efficient responses from BMSCs during the integration of Ti biomaterials into bone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Surface characterization of Ti substrates by SEM.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Ti discs fit in 35 mm culture dish used for this study.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>The cell viability test of BMSC in the luminometer culture condition.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Circadian rhythm-related gene expression by BMSC cultured on Ti discs with machined or B-DAE-DCD surface, as well as Zirconia disc.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Cosinor-based rhythmometry analysis of circadian rhythm gene expression in human BMSC cultured on polypropylene dish, machined Ti disc or B-DAE-DCD disc (24h fixed cosine curve).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s006"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Hub genes in Blue module.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s007"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of Blue module hub genes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s008"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Gene ontogeny analysis (Function) of Blue module hub genes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s008.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s009"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>ITV+ vs. OSV+ trait comparison.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183359.s010"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>ITV+ vs. ITV- trait comparison.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183359.s010.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Aleksey Matveyenko from the Larry L.
