Although the age of onset is getting younger and incidence is rising in recent years, the mechanism of pathogenesis of adenomyosis is still incompletely understood. Both hysterectomy and many other kinds of conservative treatments can fail to completely relieve patient&#x02019;s sufferings, and treatment options are especially limited for those planning for future pregnancies[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182773.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>As we know, there is an absence of submucousal layer between the basal endometrium and myometrium[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Iatrogenic injuries such as curettage, abortion, caesarean section and chronic inflammation may cause damage to the sub-endometrial myometrium. This is regarded as one of the key etiological factors of adenomyosis[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. When damage happens, glandular cells may traverse a region of structural weakness and invade into the myometrium. Damage and inflammation bring forth increased oxygen uptake, leading to an increased release and accumulation of ROS at the site of damage[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Nrf2(Erythroid&#x02013;E2-related factor 2) is one of the key nuclear transcription factor which defends against stress injuries through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and incorporatingan inflammatory response[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182773.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although accumulating evidences have indicated the protective effect of Nrf2 against oxidative stress, it&#x02019;s been shown that sustained abnormal expression of Nrf2 promotes disease progression which is related with over-oxidative damage such as chronic kidney disease and various carcinomas[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].Nevertheless, Nrf2 expression levels in adenomyosis and its role in the pathogenesis remain unknown.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the Nrf2 expression in adenomyosis tissues and explored the mechanism by which Nrf2 promotes disease progression. Our results revealed that Nrf2 is highly expressed in adenomyosis tissues and gland cells. Furthermore, the role of Nrf2 in enhancing cell migration is supported by the fact that up-regulation of Nrf2 caused paralleled expression changes in the expression levels of matrix metallproteinase 9(MMP9), which is closely related with the degradation of extracellular matrix and cell migration[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], enabling enhanced cell migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Case selection</title><p>A total of 40 endometria specimens were retrospectively selected from Women&#x02019;s Hospital School of Medicine Zhejiang University with informed consent in accordance with the requirements of the Research Ethics Committee(see in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182773.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182773.s002">S2</xref> Tables).

The endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) were isolated according to reference ranges [<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, endometrial tissue was digested with collagenase I and the subsequent suspension was filtered through 43 and 11 &#x003bc;m metal mesh to collect endometrial epithelial glands. The cells/epithelial fragments were collected and resuspended in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS and plated. HEEC were collected from the filter paper and further purified through selective adherence. Epithelial glands were serially replated (three times) in plastic culture dishes for 30 min, to allow adherence of contaminating stromal cells. Non-adherent cells/glands were transferred to 96- or 48-well plates and epithelial cells were allowed to grow out from glandular structures for 48 h. These cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Clinically, the age of patientsare is getting younger and younger. Some patients ranged from 30s-40s, were compelled to go under operation due to severe dysmenorrhea, anemia or hypermenorrhea[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182773.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, exploring the pathogenesis is helpful to define new therapeutic targets and develop novel therapies.</p><p>As one of the most important cell transcription factors which regulate anti-oxidative downstream genes, abnormal expression level of Nrf2 has been shown to be closely connected with the development of many diseases[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182773.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we first investigated the expression state of Nrf2 in adenomyosis. We determined that Nrf2 was marginally expressed in normal endometrium; while more than70% of adenomyosis cases were positive for high expression level of Nrf2. Upon further observation, glandular cells nearer to the myometrium showed stronger staining intensity. This phenomenon suggests that enhanced Nrf2 expression may be a key promoting element for the glandular cells transferring to the myometrium. However, the result displaying staining scores of Nrf2 in eutopic and ectopic endometrium had no statistical difference. Examination of RNA and protein level using clinical endometrial tissue showed that Nrf2 protein was apparently higher in adenomyosis than in normal controls, while the fact that differences of Nrf2 RNA levels between two groups had no statistical significance. Consistently, subsequent research showed that Nrf2 RNA levels had no obvious differences between control and tBHQ treated groups, although tBHQ induced up-regulated Nrf2 protein level. These phenomena proved our previous deduction that regulation of Nrf2 expression was mainly reduced from the degradation module caused by expression alteration of Keap1, not the gene translation and protein synthesis modules of Nrf2[<xref rid="pone.0182773.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To further investigate the possible role of Nrf2 in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis, we used primary cultured endometrial glandular cells derived from the endometrium tissue of adenomyosis patients. After having successfully separated from mixed cells, glandular cells were identified by immuno-staining results of cytokeratin 8 positive and vimentin1 negative. Interestingly, after being cultured for 2-3days in vitro, we found that about 60%-70% cells had trans-differentiated to mesenchymal cells in the in-vitro environment. Anyway, the cause of this phenomenon is worth further investigation. We subsequently showed that, one of the representative proteins which functions to degrade extracellular matrix, MMP9, was expressed in tandem with Nrf2, alternating between high and low expression under the influence of tBHQ or Nrf2 siRNA. Correspondingly, cell scratching test indicated that cell migration ability enhanced notably with the increasing expression of Nrf2, and vice versa, diminishing while Nrf2 decreased. This indicates that alterations of Nrf2 could trigger changes in the ability of endometrial glands to migrate in adenomyosis, possibly through the regulation of MMP9 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study showed that Nrf2 is overexpressed in adenomyosis tissues and glandular cells when compared to normal controls, suggesting that Nrf2 plays a role in the pathogenesis and development of adenomyosis. Studies using Nrf2 siRNA further indicated that knockdown of Nrf2 significantly decreased the ability of glandular cells to migrate from the basal layer to myometrium, suggesting that specifically decreasing Nrf2 expression may be a new therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of adenomyosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182773.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>The opinion of medical ethics committee of Women&#x02019;s Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University(Chinese vesion).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182773.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182773.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>The opinion of medical ethics committee of Women&#x02019;s Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University(English vesion).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182773.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182773.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>The positive staining index(PSI) of 40 enrolled cases.</title><p>The first table is about the PSI data of 20 normal endometria cases which were grouped into proliferative and secretory phases; the second table is the PSI data of 20 adenomyosis cases and the eutopic endometria were separately evaluated from ectopic foca.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182773.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182773.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Identification of endometrial glandular cells.</title><p>Fig A is the staining result with CK8; Fig B is the staining result with vimentin.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182773.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182773.s005"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>The western blot results of the 34 cases other than the 6 showed in the manuscript.</title><p>A1-4, B1-4, C1-2, D1-4, E1-3 are normal control cases respectively compared with A5-8, B5-8, C1-2, D5-8, E4-6.
