The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of dexamethasone (DEX) administered during pregnancy on folliculogenesis and corpus luteum development in the postpartum spiny mouse ovary. DEX (125 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> body weight per day) was applied to pregnant spiny mouse from day 20 of gestation to parturition. The obtained ovaries were fixed and used for immunohistochemistry and TEM analysis. The expression of proteins related to apoptosis (caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2) and autophagy (Beclin1, Lamp1) as well as PCNA and GR receptors were evaluated by western-blot. In comparison with DEX-treated group a higher percentage of TUNEL positive granulosa and luteal cells was observed in the control group. These data were consistent with changes in caspase-3 and Bax expression, which increased in the control and decreased after DEX exposure. In turn, the proliferation index and PCNA expression were higher in the DEX-treated group. Moreover, the higher level of Beclin1, Lamp1, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and GR was observed in the DEX-treated females than in the control group. Beclin1 and Lamp1 were strongly expressed in luteal cells which exhibited an autophagic ultrastructure. Surprisingly, DEX augmented the number of ovarian follicles and corpora lutea, which resulted in a significant increase in ovarian weight. These findings suggest that DEX exerts anti-apoptotic action on granulosa layer and stimulates follicular maturation. Moreover, DEX induces autophagy in luteal cells promoting cell survival rather than cell death, which can prolong the corpus luteum life span.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="14"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Excessive exposure to glucocorticoids (GC) can affect ovarian function by modulating oogenesis, folliculogenesis, and steroidogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183528.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They exert their biological effects directly through glucocorticoid receptors (GR) located in ovarian cells and indirectly through the hypothalamus-pituitary axis [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>An appropriate balance between cell death and proliferation may determine whether a follicle will continue to develop or undergo atresia as well as it is essential for corpus luteum (CL) formation or regression [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Uncontrolled atresia (caused by environmental toxicants as well as by lifestyle) mediated by programmed cell death (apoptosis and/or autophagy) would significantly reduce the number of available ovarian follicles [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, enhanced luteolysis, especially during pregnancy, can diminish luteal progesterone production and lead to abortion of the foetuses, particularly in these species in which CL is necessary for the continuation of normal pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>During apoptosis, active caspase-3 plays the central role. This enzyme is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of cellular and nuclear substrates that leads to typical morphological changes of apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Apoptosis is also accompanied by changes in Bax (pro-apoptotic factor bcl-2-associated X protein) and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic factor B cell lymphoma/leukemia2) expression [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, autophagy has been proposed as an important non-apoptotic mode of cell destruction [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation system in which a portion of the cytoplasm is enveloped in double membrane&#x02013;bound structures called autophagosomes which undergo maturation and fusion with lysosomes to form autolysosomes [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Then, the sequestered intra-autophagosomal components are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. Autophagy is a complex process involving many proteins. One of them is Beclin 1, which is important for localization of autophagic proteins necessary to form a pre-autophagosomal structure (phagophore). Moreover, Beclin 1 can be involved in autophagosome/endosome maturation. Many of these effects are mediated through the autophagic inducers and inhibitors [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Beclin1 also directly interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. Therefore, it is recognized as a seminal protein in bridging autophagy and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The other proteins involved in autophagy are the lysosomal transmembrane glycoproteins Lamp1 and Lamp2. They are necessary for lysosomal fusion with endosomes, autophagosomes, and cell membrane [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The previous study indicated that prenatally administered synthetic glucocorticoid&#x02014;dexamethasone (at a dose 125 &#x003bc;g/kg/bw) caused ovarian toxicity in the spiny mouse offspring [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. DEX enhanced follicular atresia by activating programmed cell death, which in turn depleted the stock of ovarian follicles. On the other hand, DEX stimulated the development of the granulosa-cell layer and primary to secondary follicle transition. However, the prolonged action of DEX induced atretic changes in mature secondary follicles, which were predominantly visible in the oocyte.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether DEX affected folliculogenesis and CL function in the maternal spiny mouse ovary during pregnancy. Thus, 1) the pattern of ovarian activity (proliferation index), 2) the effect of DEX on apoptosis and autophagy in ovarian follicles and the CL, and 3) the pattern of GR localization and expression in the spiny mouse postpartum ovary were examined.</p><p>The spiny mouse <italic>(Acomys cahirinus</italic>) was used as an experimental model for several reasons. It is a rodent species with a relatively long period of pregnancy (39&#x02013;40 days) and a few offspring (1&#x02013;5).The spiny mouse is a precocial species characterized by rapid development of the foetus in which organogenesis is largely completed by the end of gestation. The young are furred, have open eyes and they are able to move just after birth. The spiny mouse indicates an advanced stage of ovary maturation at the time of birth which is the result of folliculogenesis initiated in foetal life [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, in laboratory rats and mice follicular development starts during postnatal period. This makes the spiny mouse an ideal animal model for foetal and neonatal studies. <italic>Acomys cahirinus</italic> is an unusual rodent with organogenesis at birth closely resembling that of the human infant, much more than any other known rodent species. Moreover, unlike common rodents but similar to the human, the foetal adrenal gland of the spiny mouse can synthesize dehydroepiandrosterone and cortisol [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, the spiny mouse is the first rodent species known to undergo spontaneous decidualisation and menstruation. It provides an unprecedented non-primate model to study the mechanism of menstrual shedding and repair, and may be useful in understanding human specific menstrual and pregnancy associated diseases [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The experiment was approved by The Local Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation of Maria Curie-Sk&#x00142;odowska University, Lublin, Poland (2013/55).</p><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The spiny mice <italic>(Acomys cahirinus)</italic> used in this experiment were obtained from our own laboratory colony. Randomly assigned dams were divided into control (n = 14) and DEX-treated groups (n = 14) based on body weight (40&#x02013;50 g). Experimental females were mated with males in a 1:1 ratio and allowed to naturally deliver. The spiny mouse exhibited a postpartum oestrus within 24 hours after delivery, therefore this period was used as the day of conception and the next day as the first gestation day.</p><p>Pregnant dams were maintained separately in standard rodent cages at 22&#x000b0;C and 55&#x02013;60% humidity on a 12L:12D photoperiod. The DEX-treated group received dexamethasone (Dexamethasone, Tab. 0.5 mg, Polfa, Pabianice, Poland) <italic>per os</italic> at a dose of 125 &#x003bc;g/kg/per from day 20 of gestation until parturition. The tablets were crushed and incorporated within the feed pellets at an appropriate concentration, adjusted to the body weight of animals. The chosen dose was based on data published by Dickinson group [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; however, the route and time of DEX administration were modified.</p><p>The animals were fed twice daily (at 8 am and at 12 pm) with a standard diet (Agropol S.J., Poland) and had free access to fresh water. At the begining of the experiment the total amount of food consumed by the dams was calculated as three pellets (about 15 g) feeding stuff per day. In the morning, the DEX-treated group received one pellet with DEX and the control females received one mechanically changed pellet but without DEX. There was no vehicle administration to the control group except mechanical manipulation of one pellet to achieve the texture similar as the mixed with dexamethasone in the DEX group. At 12 pm, the consumption of pellet was checked and the remaining two pellets were given to the both groups. There were no differences in food and water intake between the groups. The gestation length (39&#x02013;40 days) and the number of litter size (2 to 4) did not differ between both groups examined. Within the first 24 h after parturition, dams from the control and the DEX-treated group were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>Ovaries from 6 adult females per group (24 ovaries in total) were excised, fixed in phosphate buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in Paraplast (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The 5 &#x003bc;m-thick ovarian sections were cut on a rotary microtome and placed on polysine-coated glass slides (SuperFrost Plus, Germany), numbered, and processed for routine hematoxylin-eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining and immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Follicle counts</title><p>The total number of ovarian follicles was counted as described by Tilly [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Three randomly selected slides (seven ovarian sections per slide) from each ovary (n = 12 per group) were evaluated quantitatively. Every 3rd section was chosen to analysis. The number of primordial and primary follicles calculated was then multiplied by a corrector factor of 15 (x 3-remainderm, unanalysed sections; and x 5-section thickness) to estimate the total number of follicles per ovary. More advanced follicles (secondary type and beyond) and corpora lutea were estimated by exact counts of H&#x00026;E stained sections encompassing whole cross-sections of the ovary. Follicular counts were made using a x 40 objective on an Eclipse E-800 light microscope. The oocyte nuclei number was equated to the follicular number. Follicles were identified according to the Pedersen and Peters classification system [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Primordial follicles were defined as an oocyte surrounded by a partial layer of squamous granulosa cells, primary follicles possessed single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells, follicles with more than one layer of granulosa cells without visible antrum were classified as secondary follicles, antral follicles with the antral space between the granulosa cell layer, and preovulatory follicles with a rim of cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. Atretic follicles were classified on the basis of structural alterations observed in oocytes (cytoplasmic vacuolization) as well as in the granulosa layer (disintegration, apoptotic bodies).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Paraplast sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in ethanol and rinsed in water. Next the sections were heated in a microwave oven (3x5 min in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0) to retrieve antigenicity. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol (1:1) and nonspecific binding was prevented with 5% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Then the following primary antibodies: anti-caspase-3 (1:50, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Lamp1 (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) anti-Beclin1 (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PCNA (mouse monoclonal antibody 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti- GR (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used to tissue sections and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The antigens were visualized using corresponding biotinylated secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:200, 1 h at room temperature (RT), Abcam, Cambridge, UK), avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (1:300, 30 min at RT; StreptABCcomplex-HRP, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and 3,3&#x02019;-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich) as a chromogen staining substrate. The sections were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.6) after each step of the above procedure. Next, the slides were counterstained with Mayer&#x02019;s hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted in DPX. Finally, the selected slides were analysed under a Nikon Eclipse-800 microscope with a Nikon D200-digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The negative controls were performed either in the absence of primary antibody or with the use of non-immune IgG. Proliferation index (PI) was calculated by dividing the number of PCNA-positive granulosa or luteal cells of ovarian follicles or corpora lutea by the total number of cells in the relative compartments and the result was multiplied by 100.

After blocking with 3% low fat milk in PBS for 1h, the membranes were incubated overnight with the following primary rabbit antibodies: anti-caspase-3 (1:1000), anti-Bcl-2 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Bax (1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-Lamp1 (1:300), anti-Beclin1 (1:300), and anti-GR (1:1000) as well as with anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibody. Next, the membranes were washed 3x10 min in PBS containing 0.05% TRITON X-100 (Sigma) and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:30 000, for 2h).The signals were visualized using BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl phosphate) and NBT (nitrotetrazolium blue chloride), which gives a blue reaction product. Each membrane was reprobed with anti-actin antibody (1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo, USA) which was used to control for variable amounts of protein. The analysis of images was performed using the public domain ImageJ program with &#x0201c;Gel Analysis&#x0201d; function.

Semi-quantitative analysis was performed for three separately repeated experiments from each control and DEX-treated groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Image analysis</title><p>To estimate the intensity of immunohistochemistry reaction (IHC) quantitatively for the following proteins: GR, caspase-3, Lamp1, and Beclin1, digital images from at least 12 sections of ovaries from the each control and DEX-treated females were analysed. In total, 144 sections were subjected to image analysis (12 ovarian sections per 1 animal, n = 6 in each group). The slides were processed immunohistochemically at the same laboratory conditions in order to obtain comparable staining intensities. The digital colour images were registered using confocal microscope LSM 5 Pascal (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a camera AxioCam HRc (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and connected to a computer. Images of primordial, primary, and secondary ovarian follicles were captured by a 40x objective; in turn, antral and preovulatory follicles as well as corpora lutea were registered by a 20x objective. All images were saved as 24 bit RGB colour images in TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) for quantification. A colour threshold function of ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) was used to separate DAB stained pixels from the background. To define colour threshold range for DAB, the hue, saturation and brightness for the randomly chosen sample of images were established. Then, the selected threshold was applied to extract the positively stained colour pixels (DAB) from the background (hematoxylin stained pixels) in the analysed images. The theca cells, granulosa layer and oocyte from the selected follicles were carefully dissected from each other to avoid contamination of the untargeted cells The results of 10 separate measurements (per sections) for each primordial, primary, and secondary follicle as well as 5 measurements for antral follicles, and 2 or 3 for preovulatory follicles and corpora lutea were expressed as mean &#x000b1; s.e.m.</p><p>The intensity of IHC reaction was evaluated in the 8-bit greyscale. In digital image analysis, the pixel intensity values range from 0 to 255, wherein 0 represents the black and 255- white shade of grey. In order to facilitate illustration of the obtained results (graphs in the text) the pixel brightness values were measured on inverted images in the 8-bit greyscale (from 0-white to 255-black).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All results are expressed as means &#x000b1; s.e.m, and differences were considered statistically significant at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 The differences between the means were tested with the Student&#x02019;s t-test (two-tailed test).

Furthermore, this study also showed that the expression of autophagy-related proteins Lamp1 and Beclin1 as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 increased significantly in response to synthetic glucocorticoid. The detailed immunohistochemical studies indicated that Beclin1 and Lamp1 were strongly localized in the CL of the DEX-treated group. In addition, TEM analysis revealed the presence of numerous autophagic vacuoles as well as the accumulation of lipid droplets but maintenance of nuclear morphology in luteal cells from this group. Therefore, we propose that DEX may inhibit apoptosis and promote luteal cell autophagy in the postpartum spiny mouse ovary.</p><p>Indeed, there are many reports describing DEX as a suppressor of apoptosis for example in human gastric cancer cell line [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], bovine glomerular endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], human granulosa cells [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183528.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], in C6 glioma cells [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], as well as in rat luteal cells [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There are some studies reporting that DEX can abolish apoptosis by the inhibition of prostaglandins synthesis which are the main factor involved in rat CL luteolysis [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, Komiyama et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported that endogenous glucocorticoid-cortisol significantly decreased apoptotic cell death by reducing caspase-3 and 8 mRNA expression and activity in bovine luteal cells. Similarly, in the present study, weak staining of caspase-3 in spiny mouse luteal cells as well as the low expression of that protein in the whole ovarian homogenate were observed in the DEX-treated females. Additionally, in the DEX-treated group the apoptotic index (AI) of luteal cells was significantly lower, (p&#x0003c;0.001) whereas proliferation index was significantly higher (p&#x0003c;0.001) when compared to the control group. It is interesting to note that differentiated, nonproliferating luteal cells show the presence of PCNA. Several previous studies also reported expression of cell proliferation markers PCNA or Ki67 during rat [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], mare [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and cow [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] luteal regression. It is suggested that the decline in progesterone synthesis during natural CL luteolysis may promote re-entry of luteal cells into the cell cycle and susceptibility to apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>However, the current data show that DEX exhibits anti-apoptotic action on luteal cells and delays functional luteolysis of spiny mouse CL. Based on our finding, especially TEM analysis the participation of DEX in the induction of luteal cell autophagy and regulation of spiny mouse CL life span is suggested.</p><p>It was reported that DEX is an inductor of autophagy in lymphoblastic leukaemia cells [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] as well as in rat skeletal muscles [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and the activation of mTOR signalling pathway is suggested. Moreover, DEX promotes lymphocytes autophagy especially when apoptosis is inhibited by Bcl-2 [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein can be involved in the induction of autophagy by interacting with Beclin1 [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The present study has clearly indicated that DEX can stimulate the expression of Beclin1, Lamp1 as well as Bcl-2 proteins in postpartum spiny mouse ovary. There are some data reporting that glucocorticoids, including DEX, increased the intracellular level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 which controls cell survival rather than death [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183528.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The expression of both Bcl-2 and Beclin1 was detected in CL during pregnancy and in persistent granulosa/luteal cells in irregularly regressing CL in climacteric women [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183528.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These results suggest a role of autophagy in the control of cell survival. Interestingly, in the present study, the number of CLs was significantly higher (p&#x0003c;0.001) in the DEX-treated spiny mouse than in the control. This allows a presumption that DEX-mediated autophagy also protects the previous generation of the CL (originating from a prior pregnancy) from regression.</p><p>Furthermore, Gawriluk and Rucker [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] have demonstrated that Beclin1 and autophagy are necessary for murine CL formation, function and survival. An experiment on Bcn1 (Beclin1) knockout mice revealed impaired formation of lipid droplets in luteal cells and marked reduction in progesterone production resulting in a preterm delivery phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. According to these authors, Beclin1 is required for accumulation of lipid droplets as well as formation and clearance of autophagosomes and endosomes. Moreover, it is necessary for murine progesterone synthesis and pregnancy maintenance. These data suggest that autophagy may play a role in steroidogenesis and thus in successful reproduction.</p><p>Furthermore, Towns et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] reported marked enhancement of lipid accumulation in the CL of hypophysectomised rats associated with increased plasma 20&#x003b1;-dihydroprogesterone after DEX treatment. These authors suggest that DEX increased the rates of steroidogenesis. Similarly, our findings also indicated a strong accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of spiny mouse luteal cells after DEX exposure.</p><p>On the basis of our results and available information, it can be suggested that DEX induced-autophagy represents a survival mechanism in spiny mouse luteal cells. The Beclin1/Bcl-2 complex can play an important role in the regulation of the CL life span by maintaining autophagy at levels promoting cell survival rather than cell death.</p><p>The current study demonstrated that DEX may exert its effect not only on the CL but also on follicular development. Surprisingly, in this study, the number of growing (secondary and antral) as well as preovulatory follicles was significantly higher in comparison with the control. Additionally, the proliferation index of granulosa cells in those follicle types was also increased. This finding suggests that DEX stimulates granulosa layer proliferation and promotes transition to the secondary and antral stage of follicular maturation as well as accelerates granulosa cell differentiation in the preovulatory stage. Moreover, DEX inhibits granulosa cell apoptosis. In the DEX-treated females, the number of apoptotic granulosa cells (apoptotic index) in different types of follicles was lower compared to the control. Similarly, caspase-3 staining in the granulosa layer was also weaker in the DEX-administered group. These observations are in agreement with a study by Sasson and Amsterdam [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], who reported that DEX inhibits the cleavage of caspase-3 (32kDa) and its substrate PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) induced by p53 in human granulosa cells.</p><p>It was also shown that DEX stabilized the actin cytoskeleton in human granulosa cells and elevated intracellular levels of Bcl-2 [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, this synthetic glucocorticoid may play an important role in the suppression of apoptosis in granulosa cells by enhancement of cell contact integrity, formation of actin network and upregulation of Bcl-2 expression [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183528.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is also reported that DEX enhanced FSH-induced P450scc (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) mRNA expression and progesterone production in pig granulosa cells [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Glucocorticoids exert their biological effects on cells mainly through the induction of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In the postpartum spiny mouse ovaries, GR receptors were observed in the cytoplasm/nuclei of oocytes and granulosa cells of ovarian follicles and in luteal and interstitial cells. Furthermore, the semi-quantitative analysis of Western-blot bands confirmed an increase in GR expression after the DEX treatment. These observations suggest that DEX can stimulate synthesis of glucocorticoid receptors, and granulosa/luteal cells are the target of its action. The local concentration of biologically active synthetic and endogenous glucocorticoids is also regulated by two glucocorticoid metabolizing enzymes 11&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type1 (11&#x003b2;HSD1) and type 2 (11&#x003b2;HSD2). 11&#x003b2;HSD1 mainly activates the conversion cortisone to cortisol whereas 11&#x003b2;HSD2 inactivates cortisol to cortisone [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These both enzymes are developmentally regulated in human granulosa and luteal cells [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Non-luteinized granulosa cells abundantly express 11&#x003b2;HSD2 but not 11&#x003b2;HSD1. This reduces the level of active glucocorticoids and protects follicles from atresia (follicular apoptosis). Conversely, luteinizing granulosa cells and luteal cells possess the high level of 11&#x003b2;HSD1 and low 11&#x003b2;HSD2 which results in elevated glucocorticoids level followed by the stimulation of ovulation and CL formation [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. DEX is a substrate for the 11&#x003b2;HSD2 [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and the studies on bronchial epithelial cells indicated that prolonged treatment with DEX at therapeutic doses increased the activity of 11&#x003b2;HSD2 [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, in relation to the present study it may be suggested that DEX suppresses follicular atresia partly by the inactivation of endogenous glucocorticoids. Bider et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183528.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] indicated that DEX markedly decreased the level of cortisol in follicular fluid in women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD).</p><p>In conclusion, DEX exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on granulosa cells and stimulates granulosa layer proliferation and differentiation which accelerates follicular maturation. Furthermore, DEX induces autophagy in spiny mouse luteal cells promoting cell survival rather than cell death, which can prolong steroidogenic capacity of luteal cells and the CL life span. Taken together, DEX stimulates follicular development and prevents CL regression leading to an increase in the number of growing follicles and corpora lutea, which results in a significant increase in ovarian weight. It can be proposed from these results that DEX may maintain granulosa/luteal cell survival by a stimulatory effect on Beclin1 as well as Bcl-2 expression. Delay or overturning luteal regression by pharmacological manipulations may be of critical significance in designing strategies to improve fertility efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0183528.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hillier</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tetsuka</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>An anti-inflammatory role for glucocorticoids in the ovaries?</article-title>
