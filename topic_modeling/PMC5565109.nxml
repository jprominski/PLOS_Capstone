Although antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin has been assessed for several bacterial pathogens, not all the important bacterial pathogens that are involved in the bovine respiratory disease complex have been studied. Therefore the objective of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on bovine respiratory pathogen <italic>Histophilus somni</italic>. Four, 30-mer peptides corresponding to the functional region of NK-lysin helices 2 and 3 were synthesized and assessed for antibacterial activity on four bovine pneumonic <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic> isolates. Although there were some differences in the efficiency of bactericidal activity among the NK-lysin peptides at lower concentrations (2&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;M), all four peptides effectively killed most <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic> isolates at higher concentrations (10&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;M) as determined by a bacterial killing assay. Confocal microscopic and flow cytometric analysis of Live/Dead <italic>Bac</italic>light stained <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic> (which were preincubated with NK-lysin peptides) were consistent with the killing assay findings and suggest NK-lysin peptides are bactericidal for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic>. Among the four peptides, NK2A-derived peptide consistently showed the highest antimicrobial activity against all four <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic> isolates. Electron microscopic examination of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic> following incubation with NK-lysin revealed extensive cell membrane damage, protrusions of outer membranes, and cytoplasmic content leakage. Taken together, the findings from this study clearly demonstrate the antimicrobial activity of all four bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides against bovine <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic> isolates.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was conducted at a USDA research facility and all funding was provided through internal USDA research dollars.

Based on the molecular masses and antimicrobial activities, these proteins were later named as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The AMPs, or host defense peptides, are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response and have been isolated from bacteria, insects and other invertebrates, birds, fish, amphibians, plants, and mammals [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Based on the amino acid composition and structure, AMPs are divided into several subgroups such as anionic peptides, linear cationic &#x003b1;-helical peptides, cationic peptides enriched for specific amino acids, anionic and cationic peptides that contain cysteine and form disulfide bonds, and anionic and cationic peptide fragments of larger proteins [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The majority of AMPs are known to interact with the lipid bilayer, leading to formation of ion channels, transmembrane pores, and membrane rupture resulting in microbial cell lysis, although AMPs can also interact with other microbial intracellular targets [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Human granulysin as well as porcine and bovine NK-lysin, have also been described as AMPs [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Granulysin and NK-lysin are found in the cytosolic granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK cells and have been found to exhibit activity against a variety of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites and tumor cells [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Both granulysin and NK-lysin are structurally related to the saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family of lipid binding proteins [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183610.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183610.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although most mammalian species, including humans and swine, have only a single antimicrobial protein gene (granulysin or NK-lysin), the cattle genome is known to contain four functional NK-lysin genes, <italic>NK1</italic>, <italic>NK2A</italic>, <italic>NK2B</italic> and <italic>NK2C</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Gene expression analysis has revealed that while <italic>NK1</italic> and <italic>NK2A</italic> were highly expressed in the intestinal Peyer&#x02019;s patches, while <italic>NK2C</italic> was highly expressed in the lungs [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183610.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has also been previously reported that the potent antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin is associated with helix 2 through helix 3 regions [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183610.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183610.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), also known as shipping fever, is the most common infectious disease affecting older weanling, stocker, or feeder calves causing extensive economic losses to the North American beef and dairy cattle industry [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183610.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. BRDC develop as a complex interaction between environmental stress factors, host factors, and multiple viral and bacterial infectious agents [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Various viral pathogens such as bovine herpes virus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza-3, bovine coronavirus and bovine adenoviruses have been implicated to predispose calves to secondary bacterial infections. The most important bacterial pathogens associated with BRDC are <italic>Mannheimia haemolytica</italic>, <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>, <italic>Histophilus somni</italic>, and <italic>Mycoplasma bovis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183610.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183610.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

However, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>multocida</italic> isolates were susceptibility to NK1 and NK2A, they were resistant to NK2B and NK2C. Since these two closely related pathogens showed differential sensitivity to bovine NK-lysins, it was of our interest to assess the sensitivity of the other most important BRDC associated pathogen <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic> to bovine NK-lysins. Therefore, all four bovine NK-lysin derived peptides corresponding to the functional region of helices 2 and 3 were synthesized and their antimicrobial activity on several bovine pneumonic isolates of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>somni</italic> were examined.
