cost over other expression systems. However, due to aberrant N-glycosylation, this expression system may not be a suitable expression platform for proteins not carrying N-linked glycans in the native hosts. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a strategy to produce target proteins in a non-glycosylated form while preserving their native sequence, conformation and biological activity. Previously, we developed a strategy for enzymatic deglycosylation of proteins <italic>in planta</italic> by co-expressing bacterial peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Though PNGase F removes oligosaccharides from glycosylated proteins, in so doing it causes an amino acid change due to the deamidation of asparagine to aspartate in the N-X-S/T site. Endo-&#x003b2;-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminidase (EC3.2.1.96, Endo H), another deglycosylating enzyme, catalyzes cleavage between two N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine residues of the chitobiose core of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans, leaving a single N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine residue without the concomitant deamidation of asparagine. In this study, a method for <italic>in vivo</italic> deglycosylation of recombinant proteins in plants by transient co-expression with bacterial Endo H is described for the first time. Endo H was fully active <italic>in vivo</italic>. and successfully cleaved N-linked glycans from glycoproteins were tested. In addition, unlike the glycosylated form, <italic>in vivo</italic> Endo H deglycosylated Pfs48/45 was recognized by conformational specific Pfs48/45 monoclonal antibody, in a manner similar to its PNGase F deglycosylated counterpart. Furthermore, the deglycosylated PA83 molecule produced by Endo H showed better stability than a PNGase F deglycosylated counterpart. Thus, an Endo H <italic>in vivo</italic> deglycosylation approach provides another opportunity to develop vaccine antigens, therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and industrial enzymes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tubitak.gov.tr">www.tubitak.gov.tr</ext-link>) through the projects coded 114Z258 and 115S077 to Tarlan Mammedov.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant based transient expression system is a promising technology for the production of various recombinant proteins including vaccine antigens, therapeutic proteins, antibodies and industrial enzymes. These systems offer superior benefits over other expression systems, which include: quick production timeline, low cost input, highly scalable, high production capacity and they do not harbor mammalian pathogens. In addition, because plants have eukaryotic post-translational modifications [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], including N-linked glycosylation, the technique may be particularly useful for the expression of glycosylated proteins including mammalian proteins, in which N-glycosylaton is critical for their functional activity. However, the ability of plants to glycosylate proteins can be a significant limitation for the production of proteins not carrying N-linked glycans in the native hosts such as Pfs48/45 protein of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the A chain of human factor XIII, or the protective antigen (PA) of <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>.These proteins are not glycoproteins in the native hosts, however, they contain potential N-linked glycosylation sites that can be aberrantly glycosylated during production in any eukaryotic expression system. Therefore, we sought to develop a robust strategy to produce recombinant proteins in a non-glycosylated form, while preserving their native amino acid sequence, conformation. and biological activity. Recently, we developed a strategy of enzymatic deglycosylation of proteins <italic>in planta</italic> by co-expressing bacterial PNGase F (Peptide: N-glycosidase F) [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Using this strategy, Pfs48/45 protein was produced in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> in a non-N-glycosylated form and conformation-specific mAbs, produced against different epitops of native Pfs48/45 protein, recognized the deglycosylated form of Pfs48/45 2- to 6-fold better than they recognized the glycosylated form [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, plant produced deglycosylated PA83 was found to be more stable and elicited significantly higher levels of toxin-neutralizing antibody titers in immunized mice compared to its glycosylated plant produced PA83 counterpart [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, the lethal toxin neutralizing activity and immunogenicity of plant produced <italic>in vivo</italic> deglycosylated PA83 was much higher than those of <italic>in vitro</italic> deglycosylated PA83, or mutant forms, indicating potential differences in protein folding of <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic> or mutant non-glycosylated forms [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Though deglycosylated proteins, produced by co-expression with PNGase F showed superior functional properties over their glycosylated counterparts, PNGase F (<italic>in vivo or in vitro</italic> deglycosylation) does cause an amino acid change in the deglycosylated protein at the glycosylation site (N-X-S/T) due to the deamidation of asparagine to aspartate [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Another deglycosylating enzyme, Endo-&#x003b2;-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminidase H (EC 3.2.1.96, Endo H) catalyzes the cleavage of the &#x003b2;-1, 4-glycosidic bond between two N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues with great efficiency in the diacetylchitobiose core of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans, leaving a single GlcNAc residue attached to asparagines [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] with no concomitant deamidation [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183589.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This enzyme cleaves both high mannose and hybrid N-linked glycans, however, does not cleave the complex N-linked glycans from asparagine-linked glycoproteins [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Endo H, isolated from the culture <italic>S</italic>. <italic>plicatus</italic> as monomeric polypeptide, has a molecular weight of about 27 kDa [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A number of studies demonstrated that Endo H can be widely used to study the glycoprotein functions and their structures and to estimate the number of N-linked glycans of glycoproteins [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recombinant Endo H from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>plicatus</italic> was recently expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and its activity was demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>, through both co-fermentation and post-fermentation treatments [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, N-deglycosylation of proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> by Endo H enzyme has not been achieved yet. In this study, we developed a method for producing deglycosylated proteins in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants <italic>in vivo</italic>, by transiently expressing bacterial Endo H with a target protein of interest. Our results show that Endo H is fully active <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and successfully cleaved N-linked glycans from malaria vaccine antigens Pfs48/45 or Pfs48/45-10C (a truncated form of Pfs48/45) [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and PA of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>anthracis</italic>. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, unlike the glycosylated form, <italic>in vivo</italic> Endo H deglycosylated Pfs48/45 was recognized by conformational specific Pfs48/45 monoclonal antibody, a known transmission blocking (TB) antibody, in a manner similar to its PNGase F deglycosylated counterpart; however, the deglycosylated PA83 molecule produced by Endo H showed better stability than the PNGase F deglycosylated counterpart.</p><fig id="pone.0183589.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183589.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of Endo H or PNGase F cleavages.</title><p>(A) Endo H cleaves between the two GlcNAc residues in the diacetylchitobiose core of the oligosaccharide, generating a truncated sugar molecule with one GlcNAc remaining on the asparagines (Asn).

Plant debris was removed by filtration through Miracloth followed by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 25 minutes and then filtered through a 0.45 &#x003bc;m syringe filter (Millipore). An anti-FLAG affinity column was prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Twenty one milliliters of a clear supernatant were loaded into 1.0 ml resin column equilibrated with PBS buffer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of PBS buffer. Bound proteins were eluted using 200 mM Glycine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 2.2 into tubes containing 2.0 M Tris solution to neutralize. After estimating total protein content using the Bradford assay method, fractions containing protein were combined and concentrated with a 10k MWCO Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL concentrator to a final volume of 0.1 mL and buffer exchanged against PBS. Concentrated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use.</p><p>To assess the deglycosylating activity of the recombinant plant produced Endo H <italic>in vitro</italic>, 50 ng of plant produced Endo H, purified by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography was combined with 10 &#x003bc;g of plant produced PA83, purified by IMAC, in 1X GlycoBuffer 3 (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. To compare the deglycosylation by plant produced Endo H with commercial Endo H or PNGase F, PA83 protein was incubated with commercial Endo H (Cat. No. P0702S, New England Biolabs) and PNGase F (Cat.

However, if recombinant proteins are aberrantly N-glycosylated during expression in plants, this system may not be suitable for production of those proteins in plants. Therefore, for the expression of various proteins with different post-translational modification status, more flexible approaches are needed to preserve their native sequence and biological function. In the present study, we describe <italic>in vivo</italic> deglycosylation of recombinant N-glycosylated proteins as a result of their transient co-expression with the bacterial enzyme Endo H in plants. Our results showed that plant produced recombinant Endo H is fully active <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and successfully cleaved N-linked glycans from malaria vaccine candidates Pfs48/45 and Pfs48/45-10C, as well as from PA83 of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>anthracis</italic>.

The protein is present on the surface of gametocytes, gametes, and zygotes. A challenge to developing a vaccine based on Pfs48/45 is the production of correctly folded recombinant proteins [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Pfs48/45 is a complex cysteine rich (16 cysteines involved in disulfide bond formation) membrane anchored protein with seven predicted N-linked glycosylation sites. Correct formation of disulfide bridges is critically important for proper folding of many cysteine-rich proteins, including Pfs48/45. It was demonstrated that immunization with Pfs48/45 protein results in the production of malaria TB antibodies. Our previous study demonstrated that epitope-specific mAbs I, III, and V recognized the PNGase F deglycosylated form of Pfs48/45 2- to 6-fold better than the glycosylated form [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate that, in contrast to the glycosylated form, plant produced <italic>in vivo</italic> Endo H deglycosylated Pfs48/45 and Pfs48/45-10 were recognized by conformational specific Pfs48/45 monoclonal antibody, a known TB antibody, in a manner similar to its PNGase F deglycosylated counterpart.

In addition, a conformation-specific antibody, IIC5-10 recognizes epitope III (between the residues 302&#x02013;327) on Pfs48/45 when the protein is folded, and the correct pattern of disulfide bonds is present [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Recombinant Pfs48/45-10C has been previously expressed in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expression system; however, after chemical-induced refolding, only 10&#x02013;20% was correctly folded [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Much improved refolding (~90%) of the truncated Pfs48/45-10C was obtained through co-expression of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chaperones that elicited functional TB antibodies in immunized mice [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our results showed that the expression levels, solubility and purification yields of Endo H deglycosylated Pfs48/45 or Pfs48/45-10C proteins were higher than those deglycosylated by PNGase F. In addition, as can be seen in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183589.g006">Fig 6</xref>, purified PNGase F deglycosylated Pfs48/45-10C tends to aggregate, especially at higher concentrations. Thus, plant produced Endo H <italic>in vivo</italic> deglycosylated Pfs48/45 and Pfs48/45-10C antigens have a potential for the development of a Pfs48/45-based TB malaria vaccine.</p><p>Taken together, the data supports the fact that the Endo H co-expression strategy provides another opportunity to produce important vaccine antigens, including a vaccine against anthrax, TB vaccines against malaria, and also therapeutic proteins, antibodies, and recombinant enzymes for therapeutic use and industrial applications. Development of stable transgenic plants expressing Endo H for use as an expression host, could be a useful tool. As we described above, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants expressing Endo H remained healthy at 7 dpi with no visible symptom development when co-expression of target proteins reached the highest level. Because of the transient nature of expression and the brief time span, the effect of Endo H on the endogenous protein folding and extracellular secretion was not significant. However, in plants, most proteins of the extracellular compartment and the endomembrane system are glycosylated and their N-linked glycosylation has a great impact on their biological functions [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Based on our data (above); since Endo H possesses high deglycosylation efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic>, stable transgenic plants expressing even a low level of Endo H may have detrimental effects on the growth or development of plants caused by expression of Endo H. At this point, development of stable transgenic plants expressing Endo H using an inducible system, could be a more appropriate tool.</p><p>Thus, Endo H <italic>in vivo</italic> deglycosylation technology could be expected to have potential applications in molecular farming, in the pharmaceuticals field to produce subunit vaccines, therapeutic proteins, and antibodies in the deglycosylated forms. This study can be also important for the production of industrial enzymes, especially bacterially originated enzymes, in eukaryotic expression system for increasing bioenergy, and biofuel yield, as well as improving food quality, especially by producing native additives. The expression level of plant produced recombinant Endo H was higher than 170 mg/kg leaf biomass. The yield could be enhanced after optimization of the expression conditions of Endo H in plants. Endo H has not been previously expressed in plants, and therefore, plant expression systems may be an ideal platform for the economical, high-level expression of recombinant endotoxin-free Endo H with high enzymatic activity. Finally, this approach can be applied to different PTMs for producing proteins with desired activity in heterologous systems.</p><p>In summary, this and our previous studies collectively demonstrate that enzymatic deglycosylation of target proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> has the potential to become a robust strategy for the production of non-glycosylated proteins in plants. Notably, the properties (activity, immunogenicity, etc.) of proteins produced by <italic>in vivo</italic> glycosylation differ from <italic>in vitro</italic> deglycosylated counterparts. Although <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> deglycosylated PA83 proteins have theoretically identical amino acid sequences, the lethal toxin neutralizing activity and immunogenicity of plant produced <italic>in vivo</italic> deglycosylated PA83 was greater than those of <italic>in vitro</italic> deglycosylated PA83 [<xref rid="pone.0183589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this study, our results demonstrate that the plant produced Endo H <italic>in vivo</italic> deglycosylated form of PA83 appeared to be more stable compared to the Endo H <italic>in vitro</italic> deglycosylated form at elevated temperatures, suggesting potential differences in protein folding of the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> deglycosylated forms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. George P.
