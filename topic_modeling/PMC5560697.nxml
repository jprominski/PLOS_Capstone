In eukaryotic cells, intracellular protein turnover is mediated by two evolutionarily conserved systems: the autophagy-lysosome pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In the UPS, polyubiquitin-marked proteins are routed to a large protease complex, the 26S proteasome, for their proteolytic degradation [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The 26S proteasome is a multi-subunit protease complex consisting of a proteolytic core particle known as the 20S proteasome capped by one or two 19S regulatory particles [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Alternatively, the 20S can associate with the 11S complexes or PA200/Blm10 (proteasome activator 200 kDa/bleomycin resistance protein-10) [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The 20S proteasome is composed of four stacked heteroheptameric rings: two &#x003b1;- and two &#x003b2;-rings, each containing seven &#x003b1;- or &#x003b2;-subunits. The proteolytic activity of the proteasome is conveyed by the &#x003b2;-rings [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Proteasome genes are highly conserved and the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans (C</italic>. <italic>elegans)</italic> orthologues of human 20S proteasome subunits are referred to as proteasome alpha subunits 1 to 7 (<italic>pas-1-7</italic>) and proteasome beta subunits 1 to 7 (<italic>pbs-1-7</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of proteasome function is complex, affecting its abundance, composition and proteolytic processing capacity. Proteasome activity can be directly regulated through post-translational modifications of the proteasome, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase A [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The capacity for proteasome&#x02019;s substrate degradation can also be affected by associated ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183403.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Proteasome abundance is at least partly regulated through a negative feedback loop, also known as the &#x0201c;bounce-back&#x0201d; effect, by which transcription of proteasome subunits is promoted upon impaired cellular proteasome activity [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183403.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In yeast, this effect is regulated by the transcription factor Rpn4p, which is also a proteasome subunit. In mammalian cells and in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, the Rpn4p-unrelated transcription factors Nrf1/2 and SKN-1 mediate this bounce-back effect, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other transcription factors affecting proteasome abundance are FOXO (forkhead box O) transcription factors DAF-16 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and FOXO4 in mammals by influencing transcription of the 19S regulatory particle subunit Rpn6 [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183403.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, regulation of basal proteasome gene expression is for the moment fairly unknown.</p><p>We have previously developed fluorescent-based reporters for <italic>in vivo</italic> measurement of UPS activity in live <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and shown that UPS-mediated protein degradation varies in a cell-type and age-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183403.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We have also demonstrated that long-lived <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants with reduced insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor) signaling (IIS) display increased <italic>in vivo</italic> UPS activity in body-wall muscle cells and intestinal cells, without any detectable difference in proteasome amount in whole animal lysates [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although Western blotting and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics on whole animal homogenates are currently the most commonly used methods to study protein abundance in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, these methods exclude tissue and cell-type specific protein expression analysis. To address this issue, we have performed immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> to semi-quantitatively study proteasome expression at a tissue- and cell-level resolution. To date, immunohistochemistry in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> has only been reported in a few studies on localization and accumulation of the aggregation-prone human tau and amyloid-beta proteins [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183403.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

We also show that proteasome expression is affected in a tissue-specific manner upon widespread targeted 20S &#x003b1;-subunit knockdown. Furthermore, we demonstrate that impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling of <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants does not affect tissue expression of the proteasome, when compared to wild-type animals, supporting a role for tissue-specific post-translational regulation of UPS activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Nematodes and growth conditions</title><p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> strains were grown under standard conditions at 20&#x000b0;C as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Animals were homogenized using a dounce homogenizer and native gel lysis buffer, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Western blot samples were separated on a SDS- (sodium dodecyl sulfate) polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane using Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Proteasome 20S &#x003b1;-subunits antibody (MCP231, Enzo Life Sciences) in 1:1000 dilution and anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin antibody (T5168, Sigma) in 1:10000 dilution were used in blotting. The anti-20S antibody recognizes six out of the seven &#x003b1;-subunits of the 20S proteasome (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3, &#x003b1;5, &#x003b1;6 and &#x003b1;7). Due to similar molecular masses of these &#x003b1;-subunits only four separate bands are usually detected. Signal intensity of the immunoblots was adjusted and quantified using image processing software based on ImageJ (Fiji Life-line version, 2015 December 22). Native gel electrophoresis and the in-gel proteasome activity assay were performed as earlier reported with a few exceptions [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Gels were run in an ice bath for 30 minutes at 20 mA and then for 1 hour and 40 minutes at 40 mA. Following gel electrophoresis, the gel was either blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane prior to immunoblotting with the anti-20S &#x003b1;-subunits antibody or incubated in developing buffer containing 160 &#x003bc;M of fluorogenic proteasome substrate suc-LLVY-AMC (succinyl-leu-leu-val-tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) (l-1395, Bachem).

Importantly we show that the proteasome expression pattern varies between cell types, in particularly the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic staining.</p><p>It is well-known that eukaryotic cells try to compensate for proteasome impairment by producing more proteasomes. This coordinated up-regulation of proteasome subunits upon impaired proteasomal activity was first reported in mammalian cells and is dependent on the transcription factor Nrf1/2 [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183403.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183403.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183403.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

In agreement, we here reveal that targeted knockdown of proteasome subunit <italic>pas-5</italic> increases proteasome expression predominantly in intestinal cells, but also in body-wall muscle cells. This strong <italic>pas-5</italic> RNAi mediated enhancement in proteasome expression in the intestine is dependent on SKN-1, as also reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0183403.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Interestingly, we also observed a reduction in immunoreactivity in embryos and some cells related to reproduction.
