Pathogens and other factors have been implicated in high annual losses of honey bee colonies in North America and some European countries. To further investigate the relationship between multiple factors, including pathogen prevalence and abundance and colony health, we monitored commercially managed migratory honey bee colonies involved in California almond pollination in 2014. At each sampling event, honey bee colony health was assessed, using colony population size as a proxy for health, and the prevalence and abundance of seven honey bee pathogens was evaluated using PCR and quantitative PCR, respectively. In this sample cohort, pathogen prevalence and abundance did not correlate with colony health, but did correlate with the date of sampling. In general, pathogen prevalence (i.e., the number of specific pathogens harbored within a colony) was lower early in the year (January&#x02014;March) and was greater in the summer, with peak prevalence occurring in June. Pathogen abundance in individual honey bee colonies varied throughout the year and was strongly associated with the sampling date, and was influenced by beekeeping operation, colony health, and mite infestation level. Together, data from this and other observational cohort studies that monitor individual honey bee colonies and precisely account for sampling date (i.e., day of year) will lead to a better understanding of the influence of pathogens on colony mortality and the effects of other factors on these associations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Honey Board</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glenny</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the National Honey Board.

California almond production is the most renowned example of the role of honey bee pollination services in the US. Every year, over 60% of the approximately 2.5 million commercially managed honey bee colonies in the United States are transported to the Central Valley of California to pollinate the almond crop. California almond growers produce ~ 80% of the global almond supply, which was valued at $1.7 billion in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Honey bee colonies are important for the pollination of plants in both agricultural and non-agricultural landscapes [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, high annual honey bee colony losses in the US, which have averaged ~ 33% annually since 2006 and increased from historic levels of approximately 12%, are concerning to stakeholders, including beekeepers, growers, and scientists [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To compensate for increased colony losses and meet pollination service demands, beekeeping operations have been splitting their colonies (i.e., producing two colonies from one colony) more frequently. Therefore, the total number of commercially managed honey bee colonies in the US has been maintained at approximately 2.5 million since the late 1990s [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] despite unsustainable annual colony losses.</p><p>There are multiple factors that impact colony health, including pathogens (i.e., mites, viruses, bacteria, and fungi), queen failure, colony genetics, weather, nutrition, management practices (i.e., transportation, treatments), and agrochemical exposure [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Honey bee colony health is typically evaluated by estimating colony population size [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Colonies are comprised of ~35,000 sterile female workers, hundreds of males (drones), and a single reproductive queen that can lay approximately 1,000 eggs per day [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While no single factor has been deemed responsible for high annual honey bee colony losses, pathogens are major contributing factors [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Honey bees host a diversity of pathogens, the majority of which are single-stranded RNA viruses [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Honey bee infecting viruses include Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), Sacbrood virus (SBV), Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the Lake Sinai viruses [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition to viruses, pathogens of honey bees include eukaryotes such as the trypanosomatid <italic>Lotmaria passim</italic> (formerly <italic>Crithidia mellificae</italic> strain sf [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]), the microsporidial pathogen <italic>Nosema ceranae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Paenibacillus larvae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and <italic>Melissococcus plutonius</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the causative agents of American and European foulbrood diseases, respectively.

Identifying particular pathogens or suites of pathogens that are associated with colony losses is complicated because pathogen prevalence and abundance varies by season and geographic location [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, there have been relatively few studies that have monitored individual commercially managed colonies [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The majority of studies in the US have monitored honey bee health at the apiary level with the main goals of detecting exotic pathogens and establishing a baseline understanding of honey bee colony health [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Additional studies that monitor colonies located in varying geographic locations are needed to better understand the impacts of multiple factors on honey bee colony health. To address this knowledge gap, we monitored Minnesota-based commercially managed honey bee colonies involved in the 2014 California almond pollination event. The goal of this study was to investigate the association between multiple factors, including pathogen seasonality, pathogen abundance, beekeeping operation, colony population size, and level of mite infestation, on honey bee colony health and colony losses. We determined that sampling date strongly influenced pathogen prevalence and abundance and confirmed a strong association between DWV abundance and <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> mite infestation. However, the abundance of other viruses (i.e., BQCV, LSV1, and LSV2) was not associated with mite infestation. Together, data from this and other temporal observational cohort studies that precisely account for sampling date (i.e., day of the year) and monitor individual honey bee colonies will lead to a better understanding of the association between factors affecting pathogen abundance and honey bee colony health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Longitudinal monitoring and sampling of commercially managed honey bee colonies</title><p>Honey bee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) colonies from two Minnesota-based commercial beekeeping operations that transport honey bee colonies to California for almond pollination were monitored for one year (i.e., from January 2014 to January 2015). At the onset of the study in January 2014, beekeepers identified 20 colonies that successfully overwintered. Samples from a subset of these colonies were analyzed for pathogen prevalence and abundance (n = 28), of which two died before November 2014, and were replaced by three new colonies bringing the total unique colonies described in this dataset to 31. Each beekeeping operation administered anti-mite treatments. To reduce <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> mite infestation levels in 2014, Operation 1 treated colonies with amitraz on April 22 and Sept. 4, and oxalic acid on Oct. 20, and Operation 2 treated colonies with amitraz on March 15, oxalic acid on Aug. 21, amitraz on Sept. 9, and formic acid on Oct. 24. Colony health, using colony population size as a proxy for health, was estimated by counting and imaging the number of frames more than two-thirds covered with bees. Colony health was categorized as weak (&#x0003c; 7 frames), average (7&#x02013;12 frames), or strong (&#x0003e; 12 frames) based on frame count (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182814.s003">S3 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182814.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Samples of honey bees were obtained from monitored colonies, up to four times each.
