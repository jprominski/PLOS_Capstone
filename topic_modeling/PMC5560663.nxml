Here we investigated the ligand-dependent contribution made by contractile actomyosin arcs populating the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) region of the immunological synapse (IS) to T cell receptor (TCR) microcluster transport and proximal signaling in primary mouse T cells. Using super resolution microscopy, OT1-CD8<sup>+</sup> mouse T cells, and two ovalbumin (OVA) peptides with different affinities for the TCR, we show that the generation of organized actomyosin arcs depends on ligand potency and the ability of myosin 2 to contract actin filaments. While weak ligands induce disorganized actomyosin arcs, strong ligands result in organized actomyosin arcs that correlate well with tension-sensitive CasL phosphorylation and the accumulation of ligands at the IS center. Blocking myosin 2 contractility greatly reduces the difference in the extent of Src and LAT phosphorylation observed between the strong and the weak ligand, arguing that myosin 2-dependent force generation within actin arcs contributes to ligand discrimination. Together, our data are consistent with the idea that actomyosin arcs in the pSMAC region of the IS promote a mechano-chemical feedback mechanism that amplifies the accumulation of critical signaling molecules at the IS.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHL006121-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammer</surname><given-names>John A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by National Heart Lung Blood Institute Intramural Grant - 1ZIAHL006121-04 Awarded to John A.

This recognition process is initiated by the binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell&#x02019;s surface to an antigenic peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on the APC&#x02019;s surface. This interaction results in the triggering of robust signaling cascades within the T cell downstream of TCR engagement that, together with signals generated by CD28 engagement and the interaction of the T cell&#x02019;s integrin LFA-1 with ICAM-1 on the APC surface, drive robust T cell effector function. Remarkably, T cells are capable of sensing a very small number of antigenic-pMHCs in a sea of self-pMHCs, i.e. TCR-pMHC interaction is highly sensitive [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, the extent to which the T cell responds is altered dramatically by single amino acid residue differences in the short antigenic peptide, i.e., TCR-pMHC interaction is highly specific [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Efforts to model these two remarkable properties have led to the concept of kinetic proofreading [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which has evolved to include versions that focus on enzymatic reactions (e.g. phosphorylation) [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], receptor conformational changes [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and receptor dimerization/oligomerization [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In general, the concept of kinetic proofreading argues that T cell signaling is triggered by a series of reactions requiring continuous TCR&#x02013;pMHC interaction such that these reactions are rapidly terminated whenever the interaction is lost. Direct support for these kinetic proofreading models is still lacking, however, and the models do not fully explain the mechanism underlying ligand discrimination.</p><p>One potentially critical component of kinetic proofreading that has recently drawn more attention is the role of force in regulating TCR&#x02013;pMHC interaction [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. An early clue to the idea that T cells sense force via TCR&#x02013;pMHC interaction was the observation that T cells are readily activated by surface-anchored pMHC but not by soluble pMHC, implying that physical constraint is required for T cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This conclusion has gained strong support from follow-up studies employing a variety of biophysical techniques to test the contribution of force to TCR&#x02013;pMHC interaction that include laser tweezers [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], hydrodynamic flow [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], polyacrylamide gels [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], micropipettes [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], atomic force microscopy [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and biomembrane force probes [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The strong consensus from these studies is that the TCR senses the tension or stiffness resulting from its interaction with pMHC and then converts this force-readout into force-triggered intracellular calcium flux [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and cytokine IL-2 production [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. How this occurs at the molecular level has been directly addressed by biophysical studies showing that force prolongs the lifetime of TCR&#x02013;pMHC interactions involving strong ligands by creating catch-bonds, and shortens the lifetime of TCR&#x02013;pMHC interactions involving weak ligands by creating slip-bonds [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Inherent in this concept is the idea that force controls the rate of TCR dissociation from pMHC by testing the strength of TCR&#x02013;pMHC interaction in a dynamic manner. In other words, force may act as a filter to gauge how well the TCR&#x02013;pMHC bond resists applied tension. Less clear, however, is what cellular components generate and regulate this filtering force, and how this cellular force contributes to discriminating strong TCR&#x02013;pMHC interactions from weak TCR&#x02013;pMHC interactions.</p><p>A major cellular force that acts in the plane of the IS and likely contributes to TCR mechano-transduction and force-dependent ligand discrimination is the radially symmetric inward flow of actin observed in activated T cells using GFP-tagged actin as a dynamic reporter [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This robust centripetal actin flow, which occupies primarily the dSMAC portion of the IS, is generated by continuous, Arp2/3 complex-dependent branched nucleation at outer edge of the IS, and drives the formation of TCR microclusters (MCs) and their centripetal transport towards the cSMAC region of the IS [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Importantly, the assembly of branched actin networks has been shown to produce force both in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, elegant biophysical studies have revealed that TCR MCs are frictionally coupled to the inward flow of actin at the IS [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], indicating that MCs indeed experience actin polymerization-dependent force (see also [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]).</p><p>A second major force acting in the plane of the IS that likely contributes to TCR mechano-transduction is that provided by the myosin 2-dependent contraction of actin filaments. Consistent with this idea, inhibiting the function of myosin 2 results in defects in IS formation, T cell: APC adhesion, calcium flux, early TCR signaling, and the force-dependent phosphorylation of lymphocyte-specific Crk-associated substrate (CasL) [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], although there is not complete consensus on this issue [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Absent from these earlier studies, however, was a clear understanding of where myosin 2 functions at the IS. Moreover, the nature of the actin network capable of propelling TCR MC movement across the pSMAC was a mystery because GFP-actin did not reveal obvious actin organization there [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Both of these ambiguities were resolved by Yi and colleagues, who identified concentric actin arcs decorated with myosin 2 in the pSMAC region of live Jurkat T cells using RFP-tagged myosin 2 and GFP-F-Tractin, an indirect reporter for F-actin, instead of GFP-actin [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, this second actin network was shown to be an endogenous structure, as it was readily apparent in untransfected T cells stained with phalloidin and antibodies to myosin 2. Importantly, the lamellipodial-like branched actin network comprising the dSMAC and the lamella-like actomyosin 2 arcs comprising the pSMAC were shown to exhibit distinct inward flow rates, and these rates were shown to match the distinct rates of centripetal TCR MC movement across these two regions in bilayer-engaged Jurkats T cells [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Most recently, Murugesan and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] used several forms of super-resolution microscopy including total internal reflection structured illumination microscopy (TIRF-SIM) and 3D-SIM to show that the actin arcs in the pSMAC arise from linear actin filaments generated by one or more formins present at the distal edge of the IS (of note, this explains the poor labeling of arcs when GFP-actin is used [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as formins do not incorporate modified actin monomers into filaments efficiently [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). After traversing the outer dSMAC, these linear filaments were shown to be organized by myosin 2 bipolar filaments into concentric arcs that populate the pSMAC and possess the anti-parallel organization required for contraction. Importantly, quantitative, fixed-cell 3D-SIM showed that the open, active form of LFA-1 often aligns with arcs while TCR MCs commonly reside between arcs, and live-cell TIRF-SIM showed that TCR MCs are swept inward across the pSMAC by arcs. Consistent with these observations, disrupting actin arc formation via formin inhibition or actin arc organization via myosin 2 inhibition resulted in less centralized TCR MCs, miss-segregated integrin clusters, decreased T: B cell adhesion frequency, and diminished proximal TCR signaling. Finally, actomyosin arcs were shown to be a component of synapses formed by primary mouse T cells as well. Indeed, rather than being difficult to detect or absent, actomyosin arcs are an even more prominent component of the mouse CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell IS than the Jurkat T cell IS, arguing that this contractile structure probably plays a significant role in promoting T cell effector function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Here we sought to define the contribution made by these force-producing actomyosin arcs to ligand discrimination by the TCR in the context of primary T cells. Using super resolution imaging, we visualized the actomyosin networks that form in OT1 monoclonal mouse T cells in response to a strong and a weak ligand, and then correlated the observed differences to differences in the phosphorylation state of CasL, the extent of TCR&#x02013;pMHC centralization, and the robustness of early TCR signaling and T cell-APC adhesion. Together, our data support the growing consensus [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] that actomyosin-dependent force generation plays an important role in force-regulated ligand discrimination at the IS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>OT1 TCR transgenic and C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratories, ME) mice were maintained in a Specific Pathogen Free facility and euthanized by cervical dislocation following prior narcotization with CO<sub>2</sub>.

To test this hypothesis, we allowed OT1 T cells to spread on either OVA:H-2K<sup>b</sup>-coated or G4:H-2K<sup>b</sup>-coated glass surfaces, fixed the cells 7 min after T cell attachment, stained for endogenous F-actin and endogenous myosin 2A (the major myosin 2 isoform expressed in primary mouse T cells [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]), and imaged the cells using 3D-SIM.

The value obtained, which we refer to as &#x0201c;&#x00394;MFI OVA vs G4&#x0201d;, is in essence a measure of the contribution made by myosin 2 contractility to ligand discrimination- the bigger the discrepancy in this value between pnBB-treated cells and control, DMSO-treated cells, the greater is myosin 2&#x02019;s contribution to ligand discrimination. Consistent with the idea that myosin 2 contractility helps T cells distinguish between ligands of different potency, pnBB-treated T cells exhibited a &#x00394;MFI OVA vs G4 value for pSrc that was ~three times smaller than the value for control, DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183174.g005">Fig 5H</xref>).

Only pZAP70 did not follow this trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183174.g005">Fig 5I</xref>). Of note, pCasL followed the same trend, with pnBB-treated T cells exhibiting a &#x00394;MFI OVA vs G4 value that was almost five-times smaller than the value for control, DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183174.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In summary, the extent to which myosin 2 promotes the activation of two key early signaling molecules depends on ligand potency, with the stronger ligand being much more dependent on myosin 2. In other words, the ability of the cell to distinguish between OVA:H-2K<sup>b</sup> and G4:H-2K<sup>b</sup>, as evidenced by the phosphorylation of Src and LAT, is facilitated significantly by myosin 2 contractility. As for why pZAP70 differs from pLat and pSrc, one possibility is that the activation of ZAP70 is more sensitive than Lat and Src to mechanical strain generated at the IS by myosin contractility and actin arc flow. As a result, the relatively modest difference in strain at the IS that probably exists between pnBB- and DMSO-treated T cells engaged with the weak G4 ligand is sufficient to see a difference in the activation of ZAP70, but not in the activation of Lat or Src.</p><p>Lastly, to test the contribution made by myosin 2 to T cell: APC adhesion, and the extent to which this contribution depends on ligand potency, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> conjugation assays using flow cytometry.

Following fixation and labeling with fluorescent anti-CD8a and anti-H-2K<sup>b</sup> antibody, flow cytometry was used to determine the percentage of total CD8<sup>+</sup> OT1 T cells that were in anti-CD8a/anti-H-2K<sup>b</sup> double-positive conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183174.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

Moreover, consistent with previous studies in Jurkat T cells [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the percentage of OT1 T cells in conjugates was significantly lower for OVA:H-2K<sup>b</sup>-engaged OT1 cells that had been pretreated with pnBB for 30 min than for OVA:H-2K<sup>b</sup>-engaged OT1 that had been pretreated with DMSO.

We conclude, therefore, that myosin 2 contributes to T cell: APC adhesion in a ligand-dependent manner.

Here we sought to define the contribution made by these actomyosin 2 arcs to the function of the IS in the context of primary mouse T cells, which we recently showed also contain actomyosin arcs in their pSMAC [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. More specifically, we sought to define the ligand-dependent contribution made by these contractile structures to TCR MC transport and proximal signaling by activating primary mouse OT1-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with two OVA peptides exhibiting different affinities for the TCR. By combining this approach with super-resolution microscopy and the use of pnBB to conditionally block myosin 2-dependent force generation, we showed that the formation of organized actomyosin arcs depends on ligand potency and the ability of myosin 2 to contract actin filaments. While weak ligands induced disorganized actomyosin arcs, strong ligands resulted in organized actomyosin arcs that correlated well with tension-sensitive CasL phosphorylation and the accumulation of TCR MCs at the IS center. Finally, we showed that blocking myosin 2 contractility greatly reduced the difference in the extent of Src and LAT phosphorylation observed between the strong and the weak ligand. This key observation argues that myosin 2-dependent force generation within actin arcs at the pSMAC contributes to ligand discrimination. Together, our results underscore the growing consensus [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] that actomyosin contractility at the IS contributes to differential TCR activation and ligand discrimination.</p><p>Single-molecule studies have demonstrated that ligand potency-dependent forces regulate the nature and lifetime of the TCR&#x02013;pMHC bond, with strong ligands creating long-lived catch bonds and weak ligands creating short-lived slip bonds [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. With these studies in mind, it seems reasonable to suggest that the actomyosin arcs described here generate forces in the plane of the IS that either increase or decrease TCR&#x02013;pMHC bond lifetimes depending on ligand potency. Consistent with this idea, high-resolution TIRF-SIM movies of bilayer-engaged Jurkat T cells show that TCR MCs are largely constrained to the space between the arcs and are swept inward by the arcs towards the IS center [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We speculate that this process creates strain on the TCR&#x02013;pMHC bond that could serve to test the strength of their interaction, i.e. to promote ligand discrimination. In the case of high affinity ligands, the strain generated by actomyosin arcs would drive the formation of long-lived catch bonds, thereby promoting sustained TCR-dependent signaling [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the case of weak ligands, this strain would promote the formation of short-lived slip bonds, leading to the rapid cessation of TCR-dependent signaling. This mechanism could also serve to control the balance between TCR signaling and degradation at the IS center, which is determined by antigen quality [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and the cluster-dependent phosphorylation of CD3&#x003b6; [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Future efforts must seek to extend the correlations we present here by creating experiments in which the effect of ligand potency on the formation of actomyosin arcs is somehow uncoupled from its effect on TCR&#x02013;pMHC interaction. Moreover, interventions other that pnBB that could inhibit myosin 2 contractility without altering the concentric organization of the actomyosin arcs would provide more definitive results. Perhaps most ideal would be a merger of super-resolution imaging, a DNA based-force sensor [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and ultra-fast single-molecule lifetime imaging [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], as this might allow one to show that regions where actomyosin arcs appear to generate strain on TCR MCs [<xref rid="pone.0183174.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] exhibit a lengthening of TCR&#x02013;OVA:H-2K<sup>b</sup>-pMHC bond lifetime, and a shortening of TCR&#x02013;G4:H-2K<sup>b</sup>-pMHC bond lifetime.
