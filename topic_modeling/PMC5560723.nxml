One way to apply drugs is to incorporate a cannula into the implant, through which drug solution is driven. For such an approach, perilymph concentrations achieved and the distribution in the ear over time have not previously been documented. We used FITC-labeled dextran as a marker, delivering it into perilymph of guinea pigs at 10 or 100 nL/min though a cannula incorporated into a cochlear implant with the outlet in the mid basal turn. After injections of varying duration (2 hours, 1 day or 7 days) perilymph was collected from the cochlear apex using a sequential sampling technique, allowing dextran levels and gradients along scala tympani to be quantified. Data were interpreted quantitatively using computer simulations of the experiments. For injections of 2 hours duration, dextran levels were critically influenced by the presence or absence of fluid leakage at the cochleostomy site. When the cochleostomy was fluid-tight, substantially higher perilymph levels were achieved at the injection site, with concentration declining along scala tympani towards the apex. Contrary to expectations, large dextran gradients along scala tympani persisted after 24 hours of sustained injection and were still present in some animals after 7 days injection. Functional changes associated with implantation and dextran delivery, and the histological state of the implant and cannula were also documented. The persistent longitudinal gradients of dextan along the ear were not readily explained by computer simulations of the experiments based on prior pharmacokinetic data. One explanation is that inner ear pharmacokinetics are altered in the period after cochlear implantation, possibly by a permeabilization of the blood-labyrinth barrier as part of the immune response to the implant.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Cochlear Corp.</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3462-9256</contrib-id><name><surname>Salt</surname><given-names>Alec</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by funding from Cochlear Corporation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cochlear.com">http://www.cochlear.com</ext-link>).

In this technique, 10 individual fluid samples were collected following perforation of the cochlear apex and each analyzed independently, allowing drug concentration gradients along ST to be quantified. Drug distribution and auditory function were measured at 2 hours after implantation in acute experiments, and at 24 hours or 7 days after implantation in recovery experiments.

Injection solution was made by adding FITC-dextran (10 mM) to sterile minimum essential medium (MEM &#x003b1;; 51200&#x02013;038; no phenol red; Fisher Scientific: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thermofisher.com">www.thermofisher.com</ext-link>) followed by filtration to ensure sterility. The solution was delivered from an iPRECIO SMP-300 peristaltic pump, controlled by an internal microprocessor, programmed to inject at a constant rate of 10 nl/min (0.6 &#x003bc;L/hr). Although the injection medium was slightly (~ 3%) hypertonic, the injection rate is so low (~0.2% of ST volume per minute) that any disturbance would be highly localized near the cannula outlet.</p><p>FITC-dextran did not stain the silicone tubing of the pump or the silicone of the implant, indicating there was no non-specific adsorption of the FITC-dextran to the delivery components of the system.</p><p>The polyimide cannula was interfaced to the 0.55 mm ID silicone tubing of the pump with a 10-mm length of 21G stainless tubing. The coupler was slipped over the polyimide and thin cyanoacrylate glue (Permabond 101) was applied to fill the space between the polyimide and the stainless tubing, without allowing it to enter the lumen of the polyimide. After the glue had hardened, the polyimide tubing extending beyond the coupler was removed with a sharp blade and the coupler was sutured to the implant to provide strain relief for the polyimide. At the time of surgery, the stainless coupler was inserted into the silicone tubing of the pump, displacing enough volume to completely fill the polyimide cannula.</p><p>For cochlear implantation as a recovery procedure, animals were initially administered 0.05mg/kg buprenorphine as an analgesic, then anesthetized with 0.8 to 1.2% isofluorane in oxygen, first in a Plexiglas chamber and then delivered through a nosecone. Heart rate and O<sub>2</sub> saturation were monitored with a pulse oximeter (Surgivet, Waukesha, WI). Lidocaine (0.25&#x02013;0.5 ml, 2%) was injected at the surgical site. A post-auricular incision was made, followed by opening the lateral bulla to expose the basal turn of the cochlea. A cochleostomy was drilled into ST with a slowly rotating 0.375 mm fluted carbide burr, avoiding the round window membrane. The implant and cannula system was slowly inserted into the cochlea until the silicone marker band fitted snugly into the cochleostomy, in most cases forming a fluid-tight seal. A subcutaneous pocket was made, extending from the post-auricular incision up between the scapulae. The pump was inserted into the pocket until it was located on the back of the animal. The lateral bulla was dried and closed with multiple layers of dental cement, orientating the implant and cannula tubing dorsally towards the pump. Muscles and skin were sutured closed. Animals were given subcutaneous lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution and 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine every 8&#x02013;12 hours.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Animal preparation for short injections and perilymph sampling</title><p>All animals underwent a terminal procedure in which inner ear fluids were sampled for analysis and in some, auditory function was also tested. Animals were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg sodium thiobutabarbital (Inactin, Sigma, St Louis, MO) and maintained on 0.8 to 1.2% isofluorane in oxygen using a mechanical ventilator combined with a tracheal cannula. A 5% end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> level was maintained, monitored with a CapnoTrue AMP (Bluepoint Medical, The Netherlands), through adjustment of the ventilator&#x02019;s tidal volume. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored with a (Surgivet. Waukesha, WI) pulse-oximeter. Body temperature was maintained at 38&#x000b0;C with a thermistor-controlled heating blanket. At the end of the procedure, animals were sacrificed while under deep anesthesia by either intravenous injection of 3M KCl or by exsanguination during the removal of temporal bones.</p><p>In those animals that had not been injected by the recovery procedure described above, a single, 2 hr injection was performed. In these experiments, injection rates of either 10 nL/min or 100 nL/min were used, performed with an iPRECIO SMP-300 pump (10 nL/min; 130 &#x003bc;L reservoir, available rates 0&#x02013;167 nl/min), an iPRECIO SMP-200 pump (100 nL/min; 900 &#x003bc;L reservoir, available rates 16&#x02013;500 nl/min) or with a World Precision Instruments Ultrapump (motor driven syringe pump) at 10nL/min or 100 nL/min. The injected solution was 1 or 10 mM FITC-dextran (fluorescent dextran, FW ~4000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) in a background artificial perilymph solution containing NaCl (125 mM), KCl (3.5 mM), NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (25 mM), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1.3 mM), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1.2 mM), NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (0.75 mM), and dextrose (5 mM).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Sequential sampling from the cochlear apex</title><p>Gradients of dextran along the perilymphatic spaces were measured directly from multiple samples obtained by a technique called &#x0201c;sequential sampling&#x0201d; ([<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. When the apex is perforated, perilymph is driven out by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) entering the basal turn of ST through the cochlear aqueduct, pushing perilymph in an apical direction along the scala. The first sample collected originates from perilymph near the apex and each following sample from perilymph that originated from a scala location progressively closer to the base. After all ST perilymph has been pushed out, subsequent samples contain CSF that has passed through the scala. Samples collected in this manner allow drug gradients along the length of ST to be quantified. Perilymph was collected from the cochlear apex as a series of individual 1 &#x003bc;L samples collected over a 10&#x02013;20 min period. To prepare the cochlea for sample collection the middle ear mucosa overlying the cochlear apex was first removed and the bone was allowed to dry. A thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue (Permabond 101; Permabond, Pottstown, PA) was applied to the dry bone, followed by layers of two-part silicone adhesive (Kwik-Cast, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), built up at the edges to form a hydrophobic cup. At the time of sampling a 30&#x02013;40 &#x003bc;m fenestration was made at the apex through the adhesives using a 30&#x000b0; House stapes pick (N1705 80, Bausch and Lomb Inc.). Clear, uncontaminated fluid flows from the fenestration, accumulating on the hydrophobic surface, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. Fluid was collected with hand-held, blunt tipped capillary tubes (VWR 53432&#x02013;706; VWR Radnor, PA), each marked for a nominal volume of 1 &#x003bc;L and taking 1&#x02013;2 min to collect. The length of each sample in its capillary tube was measured with a calibrated dissecting microscope, from which the exact sample volume was established.

In those experiments, dextran was injected from glass pipettes sealed into the bony wall of the otic capsule, with perilymph sampling occurring up to two hours afterwards. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the calculated concentrations two injection rates (100 nL/min and 10 nL/min). The distribution of dextran along the length of ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g003">Fig 3</xref>; upper row) and the calculated sample concentrations for 10 x 1 &#x003bc;L samples collected sequentially from the cochlear apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g003">Fig 3</xref>; lower row) are shown for high rate, low concentration (100 nL/min, 1 mM) and for low rate, high concentration (10 nL/min, 10 mM) injections from the cochlear implant of varying durations from 1 to 12 hours. The concentration distribution along ST is initially dominated by the basal turn application, with concentration declining markedly with distance towards the apex. With time, the apical concentration is predicted to rise as the dextran spreads both by diffusion and under the influence of a small apically directed flow (~30 nL/min) shown to exist in the normal, sealed cochlea. The corresponding samples that would result from the drug distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g003">Fig 3A &#x00026; 3B</xref> are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g003">Fig 3C &#x00026; 3D</xref> respectively. For both injection conditions the first sample, originating from apical perilymph, is initially low but increases over time as dextran spreads apically with time along the cochlea. Although samples 4&#x02013;5 originate from perilymph at the base of ST, they pass along the length of ST, interacting with adjacent tissue compartments, so the concentrations of samples 4 and 5 are lower when there is lower concentration in apical regions. The simulations incorporate and take into account the inter-compartment interactions during delivery and sampling. The simulations predict that substantial gradients of dextran along the cochlea will occur at early times (such as 1 or 2 hours) after injection starts. The calculated ratio of sample 3 to sample 1 (hereafter described as the 3:1 ratio) after 2 hrs injection was 3.10 at 100 nL/min injection rate and 3.62 at 10 nL/min injection rate. Previous studies have shown that dextran is retained well in perilymph (i.e. elimination rate is low), so the dextran would be expected to distribute to the apical regions within 8&#x02013;12 hrs of injection, with a 3:1 ratio then approaching 1.</p><fig id="pone.0183374.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183374.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Calculated gradients and sample concentrations.</title><p>Calculated gradients along ST (upper row) and corresponding predicted sample concentrations (lower row) for FITC-dextran injections into ST for durations of 1 to 12 hours.

The same is expected with the lower injection rate, but in this case the basal region of ST is not filled as effectively with dextran (B vs. A), so the peak of the sample curve occurs at sample 3 with 10 nL/min injection (D), rather than sample 4 with 100 nL/min injection (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0183374.g003"/></fig><p>The results of perilymph sampling experiments following 2 hr injections at 100 nL/min are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Based on years of experience trying to seal measurement and injection pipettes into perilymph, we initially expected it to be impossible to seal something the size of the cochlear implant effectively into the otic capsule. As low rates of leakage would be difficult to measure, we classified the amount of leakage based on the state of the middle ear at the end of the two-hour injection. If there was fluid leakage at the cochleostomy, fluid typically leaked at about 1 &#x003bc;L/min, which amounted to 120 &#x003bc;L over the 2 hr period. Such a volume would almost fill the bulla so it would be easily recognized. Based on this criterion we found that packing around the implant with fascia and/or bone dust was not able to produce a fluid-tight seal. We subsequently discovered that when the cochleostomy was carefully drilled with a slowly-rotating burr, without entering the scala, it could be precisely sized so that the implant would fit tightly. Furthermore, as the implant incorporated a raised silicone band as an insertion marker, we found it was possible to insert the compressible insertion band snugly into the cochleostomy, to an extent that a complete fluid seal was achieved. Experiments were subsequently classified more rigorously based on whether <bold>any</bold> fluid accumulation occurred in the RW niche during the 2 hr experiment. Those in which we found no fluid in the niche were classified as having a sealed cochleostomy. If any fluid was present after 2 hrs, the experiment was classified as having a leaking cochleostomy. In practice, intermediate, low rates of leakage were not found to occur. Either the cochleostomy leaked profusely, or it was sealed. The concentration of FITC-dextran in perilymph after 2 hrs injection was highly dependent on whether the cochleostomy leaked or not, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g004">Fig 4</xref>.

We were initially interested in whether simulations could better fit the new data through parameter adjustments or whether fundamental changes in the underlying processes of the simulations were required.</p><p>An important parameter affecting drug gradients along the scalae is the process of elimination, which represents the loss of solute from perilymph in an irreversible manner, assumed to be directed to blood. For local drug applications, longitudinal gradients along ST become larger as elimination increases. If elimination occurs faster than the drug diffuses, the drug may never reach the cochlear apex in appreciable concentration and longitudinal gradients will remain high over time. Although previous studies indicated dextran elimination was slow, we considered whether a higher elimination rate could account for the results. The influence of elimination on calculated sample curves is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g007">Fig 7</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g007">Fig 7A</xref> shows the calculated samples for 24 hr applications, with their corresponding sample 3:1 ratios shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g007">Fig 7B</xref>. Increasing elimination from ST increased the longitudinal gradient at 24 hours, as measured by the increase of the sample 3:1 ratio. With elimination half time at about 30 min the 3:1 ratio was comparable to that of the average measured curve. However, elimination at this rate caused all calculated concentrations to be reduced, with sample 3 only at ~29% of that measured. Changing elimination rate cannot therefore simultaneously explain both the magnitude of the longitudinal gradient and the amount of dextran measured in samples after 24 hr injections.</p><fig id="pone.0183374.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183374.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Inability of simulation parameter changes to account for measurements after 24 hrs injection.</title><p>Upper row (A, B) shows how calculated sample concentrations would be influenced by varying the elimination rate from ST. Concentrations of samples 1 and 2 are decreased as elimination is increased, indicating a greater gradient along ST. However, in order to achieve the measured ratio between samples 3 and 1 (B), elimination must be so fast that the dextran concentrations of all samples are reduced well below what is measured (A). Lower row (C,D) shows how calculated sample concentrations are influenced by varying volume flow along ST. Positive flow rates indicate flow towards the apex along ST and negative rate indicate flow towards the base. As CSF entry and resulting apically directed perilymph flow along ST was reduced, sample 3:1 ratio increased (D). As basally-directed flow increases (increasing negative values), the 3:1 ratio approaches the measured value. However, basally directed flow also increases the dextran concentration in samples 4 and 5 originating from the basal turn (C) as there is less dilution caused by CSF entering ST. Changing flow rates cannot therefore produce the measured 3:1 ratio and the measured curve shape around samples 4 and 5. These calculations show that the measured results cannot be explained by adjustments of elimination rate or flow rate in the ear.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0183374.g007"/></fig><p>A second factor influencing drug gradients along ST is the ongoing slow flow of CSF entering ST at the cochlear aqueduct. In prior studies, we found this was the primary cause of dextran decline in the basal turn of ST following injections, with an estimated CSF influx of around 30 nL/min accounting for the decline. Volume flow along ST towards the apex helps move dextran apically, thereby reducing the gradient. We therefore considered whether a lower volume flow rate could result in larger gradients for longer injections. The influence of varying flow rate on sample curves and the 3:1 ratio are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref> respectively. Reducing flow towards the apex does increase the 3:1 ratio, and including a small basally-directed flow in ST brings the calculated ratio close to that measured. However, changing flow in ST also changes the shape of the sample curve, specifically increasing the concentration of samples from basal regions (samples 4 and 5) as the influx of CSF is reduced. Reducing CSF influx and increasing movement from the injection site towards the aqueduct both act to increase dextran concentration in the most basal part of ST. The calculations show that it is not possible to account for the measured drug gradients and concentration of samples originating from the basal turn by varying flow rate. Simple parameter modifications of the simulations apparently cannot account for the measured dextran distributions after 2 hr and 24 hr injections.</p><p>By making substantial changes to some of the processes in the simulations we were able to approximate both the 2hr and 24hr sample data with a single set of parameters, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g008">Fig 8</xref>. In these calculations, we added base-apex gradients in both the rate of elimination and in the rate of longitudinal volume flow. Elimination was set to be faster from the apex (half time 30 min; keeping concentrations there low) transitioning to a slower rate at the base (half time 800 min, allowing concentrations there to become higher). Longitudinal flow was set to be 0.06 &#x003bc;L/min at the base (causing dilution of samples originating there), but declining with distance apically along ST until there was zero flow at the apex. This reduced the apical distribution of dextran. The slowing flow rate with distance could be thought to represent a progressive loss of fluid to some other compartment, such as the vasculature, endolymph, or middle ear through canaliculi in the bony otic capsule. With these gradients included in the simulations, curves close to the measured distribution at 2 hrs and 24 hours could be achieved with the same set of parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g008">Fig 8</xref>).

The perilymph measurements found that after 2 hr injections, large concentration gradients were present along ST. Contrary to our expectations based on prior pharmacokinetic data, the gradients remained and were still substantial, though reduced, after injections of 1 day duration. They had almost disappeared after injections for 7 days. Based on a fitted line to the sample 3:1 ratio data, it was estimated that an average of 11 days of injection would be required for the gradients to disappear. As the FITC-dextran molecule (4000 FW) is relatively large and in prior studies did not readily pass through cochlear boundaries, longitudinal gradients after prolonged periods of injection would not be expected for this type of molecule. Gradients are typically larger and more persistent for smaller molecules that permeate cochlear boundaries more readily.</p><p>Quantitative interpretation of the sustained longitudinal gradients by the simple physical processes that our simulation program is based on proved to be extremely difficult. In order to maintain a low concentration for the apical half of ST (from which sample 1 originates) we considered incorporating a progressively diminishing flow rate along ST (limiting how much dextran was carried apicalwards) and a gradient of elimination, in which elimination occurred rapidly from perilymph in apical regions. Although the simulations with these parameters provided a good representation of the perilymph measurements for injections of up to 24 hours duration, we have serious concerns about the validity of the solution. A high rate of elimination from the apex, needed to account for the results of injection from an implant, is not consistent with the findings from prior studies in which dextran was delivered from glass pipettes sealed into the bony walls of the scalae [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In those studies, dextran was lost rapidly from basal regions of ST, due perilymph-CSF interactions, but was retained well in apical regions of the cochlea over a 2-hour period. There are a number of possible explanations for the difference in observations. In prior short-term studies, dextran was injected from a syringe/pipette system with noncompliant rigid walls, while in the current experiments the implant cannula was connected to the pump with mechanically compliant silicone tubing. The increased compliance may allow greater respiratory pressure-induced fluid oscillation across the cochlear aqueduct, perhaps impacting perilymph kinetics. This explanation is thought unlikely as the greatest influence would have been in the basal turn, rather than the apex. Alternatively, over the time period of days in this study, the immune response of the ear to the implant could be influencing perilymph kinetics. All the simulations presented here have assumed parameters remain constant over time. In mice injected with lipopolysaccharide as a model of sepsis, the immune response has been shown to degrade the integrity of the blood-labyrinth barrier [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our analysis, increasing permeability of the barrier over time would increase elimination and potentially explain the persistent gradients for dextran along ST. While this explanation is an attractive hypothesis, more data are required in support of it. Nevertheless, an implant-induced compromise of the blood-labyrinth barrier may explain why extended used of systemic steroids was found to help preserve hearing [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This could be accounted for if a compromised blood-labyrinth barrier gives systemic steroids have greater access to perilymph of the implanted ear compared to unimplanted ears. Thus, while the simulation parameters derived from our analysis still provides a quantitative representation of perilymph marker levels with time for up to 24 hours, more complex explanations appear likely. To date, we have not attempted simulations with time varying parameters but realize this may be required if the concept becomes better supported by additional data.</p><p>We found that fluid leakage at the cochleostomy site had a large influence on the perilymph levels of dextran achieved. With injections at 100 nL/min, the peak sample concentration moved from sample 4 (without leakage) to sample 3 when leakage was present. This is due to the increased washout from the basal turn caused by CSF entry through the cochlear aqueduct when leakage is present, decreasing the concentration in samples originating from the basal region of ST. Although this presents a significant problem for animal experiments, the influence of fluid leakage at the cochleostomy will be far less in humans. CSF pressure in the human at the level of the cochlear aqueduct is typically negative while sitting or standing. The cochlear aqueduct is longer and narrower in humans compared to rodents [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and ST volume is larger in the humans, so the influence of volume influx on ST kinetics will be lower. If efficacy and toxicity are established in animals as the dose is varied, both may be underestimated compared to the human as the drug washout present in animals with leaking cochleostomies will not occur to the same degree in humans with leaking cochleostomies.</p><p>Placement of an implant in a normally-hearing ear resulted in a hearing loss for frequencies from 4 to 11.3 kHz which averaged as high as 30 dB. Lower and higher frequency responses were less affected or not significantly affected. The hearing loss was stable over the 7-day duration of this study. The absence of a time course of change (such as a progressive deterioration or progressive improvement with time), suggests it does not arise from gross damage to the organ of Corti or spiral ligament, or from mechanical overstimulation during implantation, comparable to noise exposure. Instead, the loss is more compatible with a restriction of basilar membrane motion, perhaps by contact with the implant, or with local disturbance of some other aspect of transduction, such as the electrically insulating silicone disturbing normal current or ion flow in the fluids. The similarity of acoustic emission and CAP changes supports the idea that function of the outer hair cells is being impeded in some manner. Although we did not quantify endolymphatic changes in this study we saw no evidence of endolymphatic hydrops in histologic specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g010">Fig 10</xref>) and no indication of low frequency hearing loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183374.g009">Fig 9</xref>). This differs from the report of Smeds et al. [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that suggested endolymphatic hydrops was prevalent in the first weeks following implantation. The magnitude of the losses found here are comparable to the 20&#x02013;30 dB losses reported previously based on ABR and CAP recordings in implanted guinea pigs with initially normal hearing [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, contrary to the prior studies we found threshold elevations to be limited to the implant location with no significant influence on high and low frequency responses. The functional changes measured here were limited to the initial 7-day period after implantation in normally-hearing animals with no electrical stimulation and therefore have limited relevance to the progressive changes occurring over much longer time courses with ongoing electrical stimulation. Nevertheless, studying the origins, mechanisms and progression of hearing loss in the implanted ear will provide a better understanding of implantation-induced hearing loss.</p><p>Histologic analysis using a technique that allowed the electrode to remain in place showed there was no indication of occlusion at the cannula outlet. This is probably because injection occurred continuously throughout the study period. In specimens injected for 24 hrs we observed a plume of particulate material in the fluid space of ST associated with the implant. The resolution of the histologic technique used here did not allow the nature of these particles, cellular or otherwise, to be identified. Others have reported foreign body giant cells, macrophages and lymphocytes associated with the implant when examined years [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], 4 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or 3 days [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] after implantation. Our observations suggest a strong morphologic response to implantation can occur within 24 hours of the procedure. It is probable that the response in the perilymphatic space of ST would not be resolved if the implant was removed prior to processing.</p><p>All experiments in this study used a large (4000 MW) dextran marker which does not readily pass through cell membranes and is retained in perilymph better than all other substances tested to date [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The low rate of elimination acts to minimize longitudinal gradients along the scala. If a substance is eliminated from perilymph more rapidly, gradients are larger and may be maintained longer over time. An example is dexamethasone which is eliminated from ST with a half-time of 22 min [<xref rid="pone.0183374.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. When applied locally to the base of the cochlea, dexamethasone is lost rapidly as it diffuses along the scala to an extent where a steady state is established and where it never reaches the apex in appreciable concentrations. We therefore expect that if gradients for dextran are present along the scala, then even larger gradients would be present for other substances that are eliminated more rapidly than dextran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183374.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Numeric data of graphic figures are provided as excel spreadsheets.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183374.s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0183374.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Eastwood</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name>, <name><surname>O'Leary</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>Effects of round window dexamethasone on residual hearing in a Guinea pig model of cochlear implantation</article-title>. <source>Audiol Neurootol</source>. <year>2008</year>;<volume>13</volume>:<fpage>86</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>96</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000111780">10.1159/000111780</ext-link></comment>
