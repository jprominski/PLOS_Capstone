An established neonatal murine model for NEC employs oral administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) combined with hypoxia/hypothermia. In adult mice, feeding dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) represents a well-established model for experimental inflammatory bowel disease.

It&#x02019;s pathogenesis still remains elusive but epidemiologic observations strongly suggest a multifactorial etiology [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several risk factors such as prematurity, formula feeding, the presence of certain bacteria and physical stress have been proposed to contribute to the disease pathogenesis. The current rodent models of NEC aim at mimicking these factors by feeding animals with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-supplemented formula milk in combination with repeated exposure to hypoxia and/or hypothermia [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182732.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Feeding and postprandial hypoxia had been shown to synergistically promote intestinal inflammation in neonatal mice [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the role of hypoxia in the pathogenesis of NEC in human preterm neonates has been questioned since NEC usually develops several weeks after birth and not perinatally, when asphyxia and cold stress might occur [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182732.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Neonatal NEC resembles intestinal bowel disease in adults with regards to pathophysiological processes including an altered mucosal defense, disruption of commensal bacteria as well as an inappropriate immune response [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In adult mice, oral dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administration serves as model for inflammatory bowel disease [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, we studied the potential of DSS-induced mucosal tissue damage to serve as a model for NEC in newborn mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the German animal protection law (TierSchG) and were approved by the local animal welfare committee (approval 12/0687 and 12/0927 of the Nieders&#x000e4;chsische Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit Oldenburg, Germany). Mice were bred locally and held under specific pathogen-free or germ-free conditions at the Hannover Medical School animal facility.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Adult DSS mouse model</title><p>8-week-old C57BL/6J mice (weight: 18&#x02013;22 g) received food and drinking water ad libitum. Colitis was induced by 3% (w/v) DSS (molecular weight 40 kDa; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) added to the drinking water. Age-matched animals served as controls. Mice were euthanized after an experimental period of eight days, in cases of rectal bleeding, or &#x0003e;10% weight loss. The complete intestines were evaluated macroscopically for signs of colitis (intestinal segments of bowel necrosis, intestinal hemorrhage and perforation). 1 cm of the proximal jejunum, distal ileum and colon was removed and stored in 100 &#x003bc;L RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at -80&#x000b0;C for subsequent total RNA isolation and qRT-PCR for Cxcl2. The remaining intestinal tissue was fixed for three days in 10% buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) and embedded in paraffin, sectioned (4 &#x003bc;m) and stained with hematoxylin-eosin using a standard protocol. Small and large intestinal tissue was investigated histologically for intestinal damage as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Neonatal mouse model</title><p>72 h after birth, litters of 6 to 12 C57BL/6J neonatal mice were separated from the mother and placed on a heating plate (37&#x000b0;C). Animals were randomly divided into two groups (i) LPS: Formula feeding supplemented with LPS from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> 0127:B8 (10&#x003bc;g/g body weight, Sigma Aldrich) and exposure to hypothermia and hypoxia as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; (ii) DSS: Formula feeding supplemented with 3% (w/v) DSS without physical stress. Age-matched breast fed animals served as controls. Starting 3 h after separation from the dam, pups of all groups were fed by orogastric gavage every 3 h with 50 &#x003bc;l (~115 kcal/kg/day) of 33% Esbilac formula (PetAg, Hampshire, IL, USA) using a 24G silicon catheter (Vygon, Aachen, Germany). To account for the increase in body weight, feeding-volume was increased daily as tolerated (50, 60 and 70 &#x003bc;l on day 1, 2 and 3, respectively).</p><p>During the entire experiment (72 h) animals were monitored every 3 h for clinical signs of NEC such as abdominal distension, apnea, rectal bleeding and lethargy. Body weight was assessed twice daily. Animals were euthanized after 72 h or if clinical signs of NEC occurred. Small and large intestines were removed and evaluated macroscopically for signs of NEC (intestinal segments of bowel necrosis, intestinal hemorrhage and perforation).</p><p>In a first set of experiments (DSS n = 10, LPS n = 10, controls n = 9), the entire intestine was harvested and fixed for 3 days in 10% PFA for histologic analysis. One mouse of the LPS group and 6 mice of the DSS group exhibited signs of NEC between 60 and 72 h, thus were euthanized earlier.</p><p>Therefore, in a second set of experiments (DSS n = 8, LPS n = 8, controls n = 8), exposure to LPS or DSS was reduced to 60 h to ensure a more homogenous study population. Small intestinal tissues were processed to isolate intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs). In addition, 1 cm of the proximal jejunum, distal ileum and colon was removed and stored in 100 &#x003bc;L RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at -80&#x000b0;C to allow RNA isolation and qRT-PCR.</p><p>In a third set of experiments (DSS n = 2, LPS n = 2, controls n = 2,), animals were treated with DSS or LPS for only 36 h to histologically investigate early apoptosis of small and large intestines prior to the occurrence of necrosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Histologic injury score of NEC in neonatal mice</title><p>The entire bowel was investigated for location, size and severity of intestinal lesions as well as the presence of intraluminal blood and bacteria using a light microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany, magnification 200x).

In a previous study carried out by our group a treatment time of 72 h with LPS combined with exposure to hypoxia/hypothermia was necessary to induce NEC-like mucosal lesions in the intestines of neonatal mice, starting at the age of 4 days [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the role of hypoxia/hypothermia in the pathogenesis of NEC in human preterm infants has recently been questioned [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182732.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, we aimed at establishing an alternative NEC model without the requirement for physical stressors. The model presented in this study represents a modification of the DSS model for inflammatory bowel disease in adult mice. To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of the intestinal histological and functional consequences of DSS administration to neonatal mice.</p><p>Both, newborn and adult animals exposed to oral DSS significantly lost weight during the second half of the first week of treatment and showed macro- and microscopic signs of intestinal inflammation. Whereas signs of inflammation were exclusively seen in the colon of adult mice, necrotic lesions in neonatal mice were preferentially situated in the small bowel and to a lesser extent in the large intestine. Likewise, the pro-inflammatory chemokine Cxcl2 was significantly elevated in the small and large intestine of neonatal mice but elevated solely in the colon of DSS-treated adult animals.</p><p>An explanation for this finding may be the postnatal maturation of the small intestinal mucosa. Postnatally, a large variety of factors, including gut peristalsis, cellular maturation of the mucosal tissue, intestinal epithelial regeneration and the formation of tight junctions contribute to the establishment of the intestinal barrier [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Especially in preterm neonates, intestinal immune defense mechanisms are immature rendering the small intestine of these children more vulnerable to pathogens or harmful chemicals. Likewise, toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) as part of a family of transmembrane innate immune receptor molecules and sensor for bacterial endotoxin has been shown to respond to induced inflammation in an age-dependent manner. Richardson et al. reported an increased enterocyte apoptosis by TLR4 activation through feeding and intraperitoneal injection of LPS in the ileum of newborn, but not adult mice [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, only marginal inflammation was observed in the colon in both age groups. TLR4 positive tissue macrophages were shown to directly control the synthesis of the neutrophil-attracting chemokine Cxcl2 following stimulation with LPS [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This is in line with our finding of an increased inflammatory response to DSS associated with an increased expression of Cxcl2 in the small bowel of neonatal mice and the large intestine of both adult and newborn animals.</p><p>Further, the size of the lesions after DSS treatment was significantly larger than in the LPS group. Whether the size of an intestinal lesion correlates with the severity of necrosis is unknown. However, the abundance of intraluminal erythrocytes as well as growth of intraluminal bacteria was significantly increased after DSS treatment, suggesting a stronger impact of DSS on intestinal inflammation in our model.</p><p>To further characterize our new model, we next investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses to DSS and LPS in detail. The humoral response was assessed by mRNA expression of Cxcl2 (MIP2) that acts as a critical chemokine for neutrophil recruitment and mediates intestinal inflammation and injury [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Cxcl2 is the murine analogue of human IL-8 which is highly elevated in human NEC, serving as a reliable marker for inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the DSS group, Cxcl2 was significantly upregulated in the small and large intestinal tissue. In contrast, no increase was noted in animals that had received LPS or control animals. In line with these findings, Cxcl2 receptor (Ccxr2) knockout mice fail to develop colitis after DSS administration [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, Cxcl2 appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation among other cytokines that are induced by DSS and LPS treatment in adult and neonatal animals [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This increase of Cxcl2 in colons of adult mice is in line with earlier studies [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>To reveal the cellular inflammatory response to DSS, the composition of lamina propria resident leukocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. NEC is characterized by an intestinal inflammation significantly mediated by the innate immune system. Thus, infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages/monocytes are important parameters in the pathogenesis of NEC [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. DSS in adult mice presumably acts through breaching the intestinal barrier, which leads to an exposure of commensal bacteria to subepithelial immune cells, resulting in inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This process has been shown to be independent from lymphocyte actions, as mice lacking T cells and B cells still develop colitis after DSS treatment [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182732.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Both, DSS and LPS treatment were associated with a significant decrease in the total number of viable leukocytes. A reduced number of viable leukocytes in a murine NEC model induced by LPS/hypoxia/hypothermia and formula feeding was previously shown by our group [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In fact, digested formula milk has been shown to have a toxic effect on intestinal cells [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], suggesting a potential contribution of formula constituents to the pathogenesis of NEC.</p><p>Analyzing leukocyte subpopulations, the amount of neutrophils in the <italic>lamina propria</italic> was significantly enhanced in the LPS model but no increase was noted after DSS treatment. However, the percentage of inflammatory (M1) monocytes/macrophages was significantly enhanced in both treatment groups in comparison to healthy controls and found to be particularly high after DSS exposure.</p><p>These results reflect a common inflammatory response, in which neutrophils infiltrate tissue first (as observed in the LPS group), but will be replaced by monocytes/macrophages in proceeding immune response (as shown in the DSS group) [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Increased numbers of inflammatory (M1) monocytes/macrophages in the <italic>lamina propria</italic> of newborn mice with LPS induced NEC have previously been reported [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182732.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182732.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In general, M1 monocytes/macrophages mediate the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cyto- and chemokines, which promotes the inflammatory response [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182732.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, it has been speculated that infiltrating monocytes/ macrophages contribute to NEC through exaggerating the neonatal immune response by releasing pro-inflammatory cyto- and chemokines [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182732.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that LPS/hypoxia/hypothermia over 72 h induces intestinal mucosal inflammation with NEC-like lesions [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Compared to the induction of NEC by LPS/hypoxia/hypothermia the inflammation induced by DSS administration developed after a shorter period and was even more pronounced.</p><p>To better understand the pathogenesis of the necrotic lesions, the viability of intestinal epithelial cells was examined. Unexpectedly, we could not observe a direct toxic effect of 3% DSS on the viability of primary small intestinal epithelial cells. This is in contrast to results from Araki et al., who observed cytotoxicity and an arrest of the cell cycle after direct exposure of 5% DSS, but of different molecular weight, to Caco-2 cells [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, Caco-2 cells are mature, human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, which are different to murine small intestinal cells. In addition this cell line does not represent the developmental stage of immature intestines found in neonatal mice, and was therefore not taken into consideration for investigating potential toxic effects on the small intestine [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Conversely, apoptosis was significantly predominant in caspase 3 staining after DSS treatment as compared to LPS treatment in neonatal mice. Thus, the observed apoptosis could be secondary to the formation of intestinal lesions rather than due to a primary toxic effect.</p><p>However, as changes of gut permeability due to dysfunctional tight junctions have been observed in adult mice treated with DSS a disturbance of the integrity of intestinal tight junctions might contribute to the development of NEC-like-lesions [<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182732.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we are aware of some deficiencies regarding in depth investigations. These are difficulties obtaining required mRNA amounts for a larger primer panel, an analysis of blood parameters and a small sample size for the 36 h test series. In future studies, further analysis of different tight juction molecules and e-cadherin should be investigated precisely during the induction phase of NEC in the DSS model, which seems to be slightly before the 36 hour mark.</p><p>Despite these limitations we believe that the neonatal DSS model for the induction of NEC-like mucosal tissue lesions presented in this study maybe superior to the previously established LPS model in several aspects. First, our new model shows the histological features of NEC, accompanied by a significant humoral and cellular immune response. Second, no physical stressors like hypoxia and/or hypothermia are required, which exerts additional harm to the animals. Finally, the observed mucosal tissue changes occur after a relatively short time of DSS exposure. In conclusion our study demonstrates the potential of DSS to induce NEC-like histological lesions accompanied by a significant humoral and cellular immune response in the small and large intestine of neonatal mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182732.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Macroscopic changes in the neonatal small intestine following exposure to LPS (a) or DSS (b and c).</title><p>(a) LPS treatment did not cause macroscopic signs of necrosis but slight reddening.
