To better understand the characteristics of foliage echoes, a new model for the process that generates these signals has been developed. This model takes leaf size and orientation into account by representing the leaves as circular disks of varying diameter. The two added leaf parameters are of potential importance to the sensory ecology of bats, e.g., with respect to landmark recognition and flight guidance along vegetation contours. The full model is specified by a total of three parameters: leaf density, average leaf size, and average leaf orientation. It assumes that all leaf parameters are independently and identically distributed. Leaf positions were drawn from a uniform probability density function, sizes and orientations each from a Gaussian probability function. The model was found to reproduce the first-order amplitude statistics of measured example echoes and showed time-variant echo properties that depended on foliage parameters. Parameter estimation experiments using lasso regression have demonstrated that a single foliage parameter can be estimated with high accuracy if the other two parameters are known a priori. If only one parameter is known a priori, the other two can still be estimated, but with a reduced accuracy. Lasso regression did not support simultaneous estimation of all three parameters. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that foliage echoes contain accessible information on foliage type and orientation that could play a role in supporting sensory tasks such as landmark identification and contour following in echolocating bats.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>IGEP - Biobuild program at Virginia Tech</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7912-3614</contrib-id><name><surname>Ming</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1053130, 1362886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Naval Engineering Education Center</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11374192, 11074149, 11574183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Virginia Tech Institute for Critical and Applied Science (ICTAS)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>We are grateful for funding from Virginia Tech Biobuild Program (url: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biobuild.mlsoc.vt.edu/">http://biobuild.mlsoc.vt.edu/</ext-link>), National Science Foundation (Award IDs 1053130, 1362886, 1611901, url: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nsf.gov/">https://www.nsf.gov/</ext-link>), Naval Engineering Education Center, National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 11374192, 11074149, 11574183, url: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>), and Virginia Tech Institute for Critical and Applied Science (ICTAS, Award ID: ICTAS-JFC 175139, url: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ictas.vt.edu/">http://www.ictas.vt.edu/</ext-link>).

Compared with bat biosonar, engineered sonar systems used on unmanned aerial vehicles are heavier and bulkier yet they cannot deal with complex targets such as vegetation in forest. For example, navigation based on sonar and other sensors has enabled a blimp to avoid large obstacles, e.g., vertical plates about one meter tall [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], with errors as large as 0.5 m [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast to this, bats have been shown to discriminate target range difference between 1 and 3 cm [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Vegetation is a prominent feature in the habitat of many echolocating bat species. When capturing prey, echoes from a highly structured background can pose a problem because they can obscure prey echoes and hence reduce hunting success [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, certain vegetation echoes have been shown to provide cues for the identification of flowers with nectar [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and for the position of fruit in the final localization stage [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, echoes returned from a distributed cloud of scatterers may make it difficult to locate the nearest obstacle or find a passageway through the scatterers. However, foliage echoes could also provide valuable information for navigation by supporting the identification of landmarks [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182824.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has been shown that Natterer&#x02019;s bats learn to distinguish conifers from broad-leaved trees [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Although vegetation echoes are obviously important to the function of bat biosonar, previous studies have either been limited to a small sample of different foliage types [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182824.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or have used a model based on point scatterers [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that cannot capture the influence of leaf size and orientation on the echoes. In current work, we propose a computational model for foliage echoes that can account for the distribution, size, and orientation of the leaves. Since it has been shown that branches typically contribute little to foliage echoes [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the ability of the proposed model to capture an extended set of leaf properties should give research into the opportunities and challenges for biosonar that are posed by foliage echoes. The goal of this work is to provide a new powerful tool for creating large ensembles of realistic echoes to mimic different biosonar sensing scenarios that are involved in foliage echoes.</p><p>To achieve this goal in a parsimonious fashion, our model uses only three parameters related to the expected values of leaf density, size, and orientation. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by estimating all of these parameters from the model echoes. This allows an assessment of whether all three parameters influence the echo waveforms and could hence potentially impact the operation of bat biosonar systems in foliage&#x02014;be it as information-bearing or nuisance signals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Model</title><p>To arrive at a parsimonious model for the generation of foliage echoes, the following simplifying assumptions have been made in the work reported here:</p><p>First, the foliages consisted solely of isolated reflecting facets (&#x0201c;leaves&#x0201d;), i.e., the model did not include any other plant parts such as branches or trunks. Second, multi-path transmission and shading between leaves was ignored. Third, all individual leaf shapes were approximated by acoustically hard, flat, circular discs that are completely characterized by their radius, position, and orientation in space. Fourth, leaves were distributed uniformly in the foliage whereas their distribution in real foliages could be inhomogeneous, e.g., due to branching patterns. Here, all leaves are distributed uniformly inside a rectangular box positioned one meter away from the sonar along the direction of the sonar&#x02019;s aim. The values of the other two parameters were independently identically distributed Gaussian random variables. To further simplify the model, it was assumed that the standard deviation for the Gaussian distribution of the leaf radii was tied to the mean. It was taken to be one tenth of the mean. In this way, leaves that were larger on average also varied more in size. The standard deviation of the orientation angle of the leaf was fixed at a value of 5&#x000b0;. Under these assumptions, the simplified model foliages can be described by three parameters: the mean leaf radius <italic>r</italic>, leaf density <italic>&#x003c1;</italic> (number of leaves per cubic meter) and mean leaf orientation <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182824.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

The sum of the absolute values was limited to a maximum value. This maximum value, called a &#x0201c;tuning parameter&#x0201d; can be used to control number of features used.

Similarly, measures of how the peaks in the echo amplitude were distributed in time over the entire echo were used as a basis for estimating the foliage model parameters, which are more related to leaf density and may help estimation by isolating the impact of density from that of the other two parameters on echoes.

The following features were derived from the magnitudes of the envelope of the entire signal: area under the envelope, quantiles (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.999) of magnitude values that were larger than the magnitude threshold, central moments (2nd to 5th) of the above-threshold magnitude values, the same four central moments for time intervals longer than a 20 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>s threshold. The time-differences were measured between neighboring points in the signal envelope that were higher than the threshold, and a set of quantiles (0.95, 0.99, 0.999) of those selected time intervals. The quantiles were used to describe the shape of the probability density function (pdf) of those magnitudes. The 2nd central moment is the variance and the scaled version of third central moment is skewness, a measure of the lopsidedness of the distribution. The scaled version of fourth central moment is kurtosis and serves as a measure of the heaviness of the tail of the distribution. Features calculated within the 10 time windows were: the number of magnitude values larger than the threshold in each window and mean value of the magnitudes above the threshold in each window.</p><p>Cross validation was used to find the tuning parameter and avoid overfitting. It was carried out using 80% of the echoes. This cross-validation echo data set was divided into 10 subsets of equal size. One subset was excluded and the lasso model was fitted to the remaining nine subsets of the echoes. Then the model was tested on the excluded subset. The process was repeated 10 times in total where each time a different subset was excluded. The estimation errors made over all these 10 tests were summed and used to determine the value of tuning parameter that resulted in the minimum error.</p><p>With this cross validation followed by the lasso regression itself, foliage parameter estimates were carried out for the following three scenarios: (i) estimation of a single unknown foliage parameter with the other two parameters fixed, (ii) estimation of one foliage parameter with the second parameter fixed and the third parameter left to assume unknown and variable values, and (iii) estimation of one parameter with the other two parameters remaining unknown and subject to change.</p><p>In all these estimation scenarios, the following values were used for the known/fixed parameters: leaf density 100/m<sup>3</sup>, mean orientation angle 7&#x000b0;, and mean leaf radius 15 mm.

Parameters to be estimated were left to take any integer within the following intervals: leaf density [20, 500]m<sup>3</sup>, mean orientation angle [0, 90]&#x000b0;, and mean leaf radius [5, 20]mm. For the estimation of a single unknown parameter, 100 echoes each were generated for 100 different parameter combinations. As described above, 80 of these echoes were used for training and the remaining ones were used to test the lasso model. For the estimation of parameters in other situations, 500 echoes were generated from 100 parameter combinations with 5 echoes from each.

A power amplifier (AA-301HS, A.A. Lab Systems Ltd. Ramat-Gan, Israel) was used to drive the loudspeaker. Two MEMS capacitive microphones (SPU0410LR5H, Knowles Electronics, LLC.

An A/D and D/A conversion board (NI-6351, National Instruments Corp., Austin, TX USA) was used in the setup and provided 16-bit resolution and 500 kHz sampling rate for digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion. The sonar head was mounted on a tripod, the height of which above ground was adjusted according to different trees to let the transmitted signal hit the foliage at an approximately normal incident angle. The emitted signal consisted of a 5-ms-long linearly modulated chirp covering a frequency band from 20 to 100 kHz.

The mean leaf area over 30 leaves was obtained by calculating the area of each leaf after scanning it and counting the dark (green) pixels. The equivalent leaf radius that produced the same area for a circular disk was used to determine the mean leaf radius of the model, which was 1.46 cm. Mean orientation angle and density were decided based on observation. The foliage of Japanese maple consisted of dense leaves with mean orientation angle about 45&#x000b0;, and thus the density was set to 5000/m<sup>3</sup>. The arborvitae had foliage with forms of flat sprays with scale-like leaves; in the model, 1 mm, 45&#x000b0;, and 10000/m<sup>3</sup> were used to represent its mean leaf radius, orientation angle, and leaf density, respectively. The measured echoes were first filtered with passband 20&#x02013;110 kHz, then cross-correlated with emitted signal to acquire the impulse response, and filtered again with passband 60&#x02013;80 kHz to match the frequency range in simulation.</p><p>In the simulation that were designed to mimic the measured tree foliages, the length of the foliage domain along the sonar&#x02019;s line of sight was set to match the pulse duration observed in the field recordings.

The same distance was then used in the respective simulations. The -3 dB sonar beamwidth for these simulations was set to 10&#x000b0; to match the beamwidth of the experimental setup.</p><p>For a quantitative comparison between the simulated and the measured foliage echoes, each echo was divided into three time windows of equal length.

The values of the Bhattacharyya distance range from zero to infinity. The smaller the distance is, the better two pdfs match each other.

For example, in the central time windows of the echoes from the arborvitae, the average Bhattacharyya distance between pdfs of simulated echoes was 0.03 (&#x000b1;0.02 standard deviation, <italic>N</italic> = 5) that between pdfs of measured echoes was 0.04 (&#x000b1;0.02 standard deviation, <italic>N</italic> = 5), and that between simulated and measured echoes was 0.03 (&#x000b1;0.02 standard deviation, <italic>N</italic> = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182824.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0182824.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182824.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Comparison between examples of simulated and measured echoes.</title><p>A-B) Simulated echoes: A) with parameters similar to the Japanese maple specimen: mean leaf radius 1.46 cm, density 5000/m<sup>3</sup>, and mean orientation angle 45&#x000b0;.

That was reflected by amplitude probability density functions with decreasing spread over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182824.g007">Fig 7</xref>). However, after the effects of the geometric spreading losses were removed from the echoes, the resulting amplitudes remained time-variant but with a reverse dependence where the spread of the amplitude probability functions tended to increase with time (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182824.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182824.g009">9</xref>). This remaining non-stationary behavior of the echoes was quantified using the Bhattacharyya distance as a difference measure for probability density functions associated with different times during the echoes. This analysis provided evidence that the time-variant behavior of the probability density functions was linked to the properties of the model foliages: For example, among all the Bhattacharyya distances obtained between probability density functions obtained for different time windows positioned within the central 80% of the echo durations, the 95%-percentile of the differences increased by 40% (from 0.1 to 0.14) as the leaf density was increased from 20/m<sup>3</sup> to 500/m<sup>3</sup>. Hence, in this case, the 5% largest differences between the probability density functions increased as the model foliages (mean leaf radius: 5mm, mean leaf orientation: 90&#x000b0;) became denser. Likewise, the Bhattacharyya distances were also found to depend on leaf orientation: As the average leaf orientation was changed from 0&#x000b0; to 90&#x000b0;, the 95%-percentile of the Bhattacharyya distance was reduced by 50% from 0.24 to 0.12. Hence, the time variance was greater when the leaves were oriented with respect to the sonar&#x02019;s light of sight.</p><fig id="pone.0182824.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182824.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Example of time-varying echo and its probability density functions in three different windows.</title><p>A) simulated echo waveform with envelope (black) computed without inclusion of spreading losses.

This introduces two additional parameters, leaf size and leaf orientation, that are not needed in models based on omnidirectional point scatterers [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While addition of these parameters makes the model more complicated, both of these foliage parameters could be of importance to the sensory ecology of bats: Being able to estimate the average size of the leaves in a foliage could help bats to identify the type (e.g., the species) of trees or bushes they encounter. The ability to tell the type of a foliage from the echoes could, in turn, support the recognition of individual trees or bushes that may serve as landmarks for navigation. Similarly, the ability to identify foliage types could help the bats to find their food if certain foliage types are more likely associated with the presence of food [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182824.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] than others. Leaf orientation could play an important role in guiding the bats&#x02019; flight path in close proximity to foliage [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], e.g., when the animals are following the contour of a vegetation edge. Since the leaf normals in a foliage are likely to be oriented towards the surface of the foliage, being able to tell the average direction of the leaf surface normals could be a convenient way to determine the orientation of a foliage contour and control the direction of a flight path that follows the contour without collision.</p><p>The results presented here demonstrate that estimation of foliage parameters (leaf density, average leaf size and orientation) from the echo waveforms is possible using echo features that could also be accessible to bats in a similar form. However, with the method used here (lasso regression), highly accurate estimation was only possible for a single unknown parameter. Estimation of two unknown parameters yielded results that could still be useful, but provided a much lower accuracy than was the case for a single parameter. Since there is no reason to believe that present results constitute an upper bound on the achievable performance, it remains possible that bats may be able to perform vastly better than the current pilot results. But even if this is not the case, the level of estimator performance demonstrated here could be very helpful to bats in densely vegetated habitats. For example, a bat may have sufficient <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge about the leaf density and average leaf size in the foliage of its habitat. A bat armed with such accurate <italic>a priori</italic> information would be able to get precise estimates of average leaf orientation that it could use to follow foliage contours within a known habitat. For landmark identification in an uncertain location, bats may be able to determine the orientation of the foliage surface and hence the average orientation of the leaf normals through other means, e.g., by looking at the foliage surface from different directions. Once the average orientation of the leaves is known, the animals could use this <italic>a priori</italic> information to obtain estimates for leaf density and average leaf size to identify a known landmark tree or bush by its foliage type.</p><p>Spreading losses for ultrasonic waves traveling in a three-dimensional medium impose strong time-variant signatures onto echoes that originate from a foliage where the reflectors (leaves) are spaced over a wide range of distances from the sonar. However, these effects do not reveal much about the target other than the range at which a certain component of the target&#x02019;s impulse response has originated. However, the same information is already available from the time of flight in a much more reliable fashion since echo amplitude depends on transmission losses as well as target strength whereas time of flight depends only on target range. Hence, the effects of spreading losses on an echo are probably not a prime information-bearing echo features by themselves. The time-variant effects that were found in the model echoes studied here after spreading losses were removed could be more informative than the spreading losses since they were found to depend on all three foliage parameters. No information is available in the literature at the time of writing as to whether bats would be able to sense different time-variant behaviors within an echo waveform. It has been shown, however, that bats can distinguish smooth and rough echo waveforms [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Detecting time-variant changes in an echo waveform could possibly be handled through mechanisms that are similar to detecting the ups and downs in a rough waveform.</p><p>In the current work, echoes were simulated within a 20 kHz frequency band that is similar to the strongest harmonic of greater horseshoe bats. This is much narrower than the 115 kHz bandwidth that has been previously used for the classification of vegetation echoes [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182824.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The results obtained here hence demonstrate that even bat species with fairly &#x0201c;narrow-band&#x0201d; biosonar signals could already have access to detailed information about complex vegetation environments without the need for the high degree of precision that large pulse bandwidths can convey [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182824.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The simulation model studied here has been simplified by neglecting properties of natural foliages such as variable leaf geometries, acoustic shading of one leaf by another, multipath sound propagation across multiple leaves, and inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the leaves. It remains to be seen to which extent these factors could effect the characteristics of foliage echoes. Previous findings suggest that adding clusters to the spatial leaf distribution improves the goodness of fit between real data and simulation [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but a full investigation of the role of leaf inhomogeneity still needs to be undertaken. Similarly, it should be investigated if alternatives to the parameter estimation approach used here suffer from the same limitation on the number of parameters that can be estimated simultaneously or if it would be possible to arrive at accurate estimates for all parameters of an unknown foliage. Sequential estimation could be a candidate methods for achieving this, since it has been demonstrated to add to performance in bioinspired classification of foliage echoes [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Bats could even control their motions to enhance the encoding of sensory information on the foliage [<xref rid="pone.0182824.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. If indeed all three foliage parameters considered here could be estimated without prior knowledge, it would give bats many more opportunities to master the demanding sensory task associated with navigation in complex natural environments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Philip Caspers for the development of the biomimetic sonar system.
