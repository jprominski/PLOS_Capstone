One potential drawback of this method are severe photopenic (halo-) artifacts surrounding the bladder and the kidneys in the scatter-corrected PET images, which have been reported to occur frequently in clinical practice. The goal of this work was to investigate the occurrence and impact of these artifacts and, secondly, to evaluate variants of the standard scatter correction method with regard to halo-artifact suppression.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Experiments using a dedicated pelvis phantom were conducted to investigate whether the halo-artifact is modality-, tracer-, and/or concentration-dependent. Furthermore, 31 patients with history of prostate cancer were selected from an ongoing <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI study. For each patient, PET raw data were reconstructed employing six different variants of PET scatter correction: absolute scatter scaling, relative scatter scaling, and relative scatter scaling combined with prompt gamma correction, each of which was combined with a maximum scatter fraction (MaxSF) of MaxSF = 75% or MaxSF = 40%. Evaluation of the reconstructed images with regard to halo-artifact suppression was performed both quantitatively using statistical analysis and qualitatively by two independent readers.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>The phantom experiments did not reveal any modality-dependency (PET/MRI vs. PET/CT) or tracer-dependency (<sup>68</sup>Ga vs. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG). Patient- and phantom-based data indicated that halo-artifacts derive from high organ-to-background activity ratios (OBR) between bladder/kidneys and surrounding soft tissue, with a positive correlation between OBR and halo size. Comparing different variants of scatter correction, reducing the maximum scatter fraction from the default value MaxSF = 75% to MaxSF = 40% was found to efficiently suppress halo-artifacts in both phantom and patient data. In 1 of 31 patients, reducing the maximum scatter fraction provided new PET-based information changing the patient&#x02019;s diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Halo-artifacts are particularly observed for <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI due to 1) the biodistribution of the PSMA-11-tracer resulting in large OBRs for bladder and kidneys and 2) inaccurate scatter correction methods currently used in clinical routine, which tend to overestimate the scatter contribution. If not compensated for, <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 uptake pathologies may be masked by halo-artifacts leading to false-negative diagnoses.

Particularly, <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI is very promising as both the excellent diagnostic performance of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET for lymph node metastases [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></italic>] and the high spatial resolution and soft tissue contrast of MRI, beneficial for imaging the pelvis/abdomen, are combined while minimizing radiation exposure compared to PET/CT.</p><p>PSMA is scarcely expressed in abdominal fat and soft tissue while a large proportion of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 is excreted by the urine and collected within the urinary system [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></italic>], resulting in extreme activity concentration differences between bladder/kidneys and surrounding background. Thus, large organ-to-background activity ratios (OBRs) sometimes result in photopenic artifacts surrounding the kidneys and the bladder in both PET/CT [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></italic>] and, in particular, PET/MRI [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></italic>]. These so-called halo-artifacts pose one potential drawback of the clinical use of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI for prostate cancer detection and staging. Both primary prostate cancer and local recurrences after radical prostatectomy are typically located very close to the bladder and any photopenic artifact surrounding the bladder could potentially mask findings, falsify uptake values and thus influence the patients&#x02019; diagnosis. Additionally, retroperitoneally between the kidneys, the halo may, potentially, mask metastases and thus impair tumor detectability and staging.</p><p>There is evidence that halo-artifacts in <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI are caused by scatter correction [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></italic>]. The most widely used scatter correction technique in clinical PET imaging is based on the single scatter simulation (SSS) algorithm [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></italic>], which analytically estimates the scatter contribution from a coarse initial activity image by employing a simplified physical model. SSS explicitly models only single scatter events while multiple scatter and other physical aspects like scatter from activity located outside the field of view (FOV) are neglected. Due to the simplifications and the potentially inaccurate initial activity estimate, SSS can only estimate the shape of the scatter contribution but not its magnitude [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></italic>]. The resulting shift of the estimated scatter contribution with respect to the measured emission data requires additional scaling. There are two different methods to perform scatter scaling which are currently available in clinical practice. Relative scaling scales the estimated scatter obtained by SSS to fit to the scatter tails of the measured PET emission data, i.e., to the measured events outside the patient outline, which are assumed to stem from scatter events only. Absolute scaling, on the other hand, also estimates the distribution of unscattered events based on the initial activity estimate and employing a forward model. This allows to relate the SSS-based scatter estimate to the estimated unscattered component, which further allows for an intrinsic scaling of the estimated scatter, without the need to access the emission data [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></italic>]. In principle, relative SSS and absolute SSS differ only in the way the SSS scatter estimate is scaled, i.e., only the magnitude of the final scatter, not its shape is different. However, since the scatter estimate is usually refined iteratively, differences in the initial magnitude may also alter the scatter shape throughout the iterative process, such that both magnitude and shape obtained with relative and absolute SSS differ in general,</p><p>While relative scaling can in principle also compensate for multiple scatter and for scatter contributions from activity located outside the FOV, this is not the case for absolute scaling. This may be one reason why relative scaling is the default in clinical PET imaging. For highly specific PET tracers, such as <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 for example, our experience from daily clinical practice indicates that images based on absolute SSS are, however, less prone to halo-artifacts as compared to relative SSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0183329.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183329.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Example for halo-artifacts surrounding the urinary bladder and the kidneys.</title><p>(A) PET images in coronal slice orientation for a 59 years old patient with and without scatter correction (SC). Administered activity was 144 MBq of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 and the patient was scanned with the mMR 104 min p.i. Absolute SSS resulted in a strongly reduced halo-artifact around the bladder compared to relative SSS. (B) Sinograms corresponding to the direct plane indicated by the dashed red line. Shown are the prompts after subtraction of the estimated scatter. Note the grayscale windowing, which is chosen such that white color indicates negative values.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0183329.g001"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g001">Fig 1B</xref> presents 2D sinograms corresponding to the direct plane indicated by the dashed red line. The sinograms show the measured prompt events (prior to gap filling) after subtraction of the scatter estimates. Without scatter correction, the scatter estimate is zero, and the respective sinogram shows the unmodified prompts. In case of SSS-based scatter correction, the presented sinograms contain negative values for a large amount of lines of response (LORs) crossing the region surrounding the bladder. These negative values indicate that the estimated scatter is larger than the measured prompt events for the corresponding LORs. From a physical point of view, this does not make sense, since the prompts are the sum of the measured true, scattered, and random events. If the scatter estimate exceeds the measured prompts, the reconstruction algorithm, usually ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) in clinical PET imaging, enforces zero-valued voxels in the affected region. If there was no non-negativity constraint as with OSEM, the voxels surrounding the bladder would even be assigned negative values, as it is the case with the filtered backprojection algorithm implemented by the vendor. The example presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g001">Fig 1</xref> impressively demonstrates that the current implementation of SSS may result in scatter overestimation, which is the cause of halo-artifacts frequently observed in <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI.</p><p>Furthermore, in <sup>68</sup>Ga decay, prompt or cascade gammas emitted simultaneously with positron emission occur with a branching ratio of around 1.2% [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></italic>]. The gammas have an energy of 1077 keV and are thus way above the energy window of all clinical PET scanners (e.g., 430 to 610 keV for the Siemens Biograph mMR). If, however, the gammas are scattered prior to being detected, their energy may fall within the energy window. In such a case, coincidences between prompt gammas and annihilation photons cannot be distinguished from true coincidences and degrade the image quality if not compensated for [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></italic>].

The maximum outer dimensions of the phantom are about 40 cm within the transaxial plane and about 20 cm in axial direction, such that it can be entirely covered by a single bed position both with the mMR and the mCT. Both bladder and background were filled with deionized water and 0.9% NaCl for all measurements.

We administered 33 MBq of <sup>68</sup>Ga to the background and 23 MBq of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG to the bladder. Due to the longer half-life of <sup>18</sup>F (T<sub>1/2</sub> = 110 min) compared to <sup>68</sup>Ga (T<sub>1/2</sub> = 68 min), the OBR increases over time with an expected doubling every 178 min.

Default parameters were used and kept constant for all experiments (energy window: 430 to 610 keV, number of iterations: 4, additional scale factor: 1.0) with the exception of the parameters described in the following. We either used relative (Rel) or absolute (Abs) scaling of the estimated scatter, as described in the introduction section. In addition, we modified the maximum scatter fraction (MaxSF), which sets an artificial threshold to the estimated scatter fraction (SF), i.e., to the ratio of the SSS-based scatter estimate and the acquired prompt events. If the initially estimated SF after absolute or relative scaling exceeds MaxSF, then additional scaling of the entire scatter estimate is performed such that the final SF equals MaxSF. Therefore, from an algorithmic point of view, modifying MaxSF only changes this additional scatter downscaling. Employing a reduced value for MaxSF was motivated since SSS using a default MaxSF = 75%, as implemented by the vendor, tends to overestimate scatter in <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-PET, potentially resulting in halo-artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In this work, we show results obtained with MaxSF = 40% and some with MaxSF = 30% along with the default value of MaxSf = 75%.

Evaluating our phantom measurements, we could clearly demonstrate that these so-called halo-artifacts are neither tracer-dependent (neglecting the physiological biodistribution) nor modality-dependent (neglecting TOF information and impact of improper attenuation maps). Since halo-artifacts were also present when <sup>18</sup>F-FDG was used as tracer and since their size and appearance was comparable to the <sup>68</sup>Ga-case, prompt gammas could be excluded as being the main reason for halo-artifacts. Nevertheless, prompt gamma correction (PGC) was found to be beneficial in some cases when combined with relative SSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183329.t002">Table 2</xref>). However, PGC was sufficient to entirely remove the halo-artifact around the bladder in only 8 out of 21 patients and around the kidneys in only 6 out of 16 patients. For some patients, the effect of PGC was close to zero, especially for halo-artifacts around the bladder. Similar results have recently been published by Noto et al. [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></italic>]. Hong et al. observed significant improvements in halo-artifact appearance for <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-PET/CT when PGC was applied [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></italic>]. In their patient study, halo-artifacts around the kidneys could be entirely removed in 5 out 6 cases, with only a very faint halo still present for the sixth patient. The reason why PGC seems to be more effective in the PET/CT study as compared to the PET/MRI studies presented in this work as well as by Noto et al. [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></italic>] is most likely because of the different arm positioning (arms up for PET/CT and arms down for PET/MRI). In addition, patients were scanned up to 3 h p.i. in our study, potentially resulting in very high OBRs, especially around the bladder.</p><p>The phantom experiments also showed comparable halo-artifacts in PET/MRI and PET/CT. Since the impact of an inaccurate MRI-based attenuation map was excluded by using a PET/CT-derived attenuation map of the phantom, only the PET-components of the two modalities were compared. Incorporating TOF information into reconstruction of the PET/CT data resulted in slightly reduced halo-artifacts, indicating that TOF is able to partially compensate for data inconsistencies induced by inaccurate scatter estimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This observation is in accordance with the literature, where benefits of TOF, apart from increased signal-to-noise ratios [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></italic>], have been reported in case of inconsistent data, e.g., for incorrect MR-based attenuation maps [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></italic>]. However, for the phantom experiments performed in this work, TOF information was not sufficient to entirely suppress halo-artifacts induced by incorrect scatter estimates. For patient data, inaccurate and truncated attenuation maps, the lack of TOF information and larger time differences between tracer injection and patient investigation, potentially resulting in increased OBRs, may be the reason why non-TOF PET/MRI is more prone to halo-artifacts than PET/CT with TOF capability.</p><p>The reason why halo-artifacts have been reported for <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 but not for <sup>18</sup>F-FDG most likely lies in the completely different tracer accumulation in human tissue, with<sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11 being much more specific, resulting in significantly higher OBRs in clinical practice. Both the phantom experiments and the patient data demonstrated a positive correlation between OBR and occurrence and size of the halo-artifact, i.e., increasing OBR results in increasing halo size. These observations suggest asking the patient to void his bladder directly before PET raw data acquisition, possibly under stimulation by diuretic medication [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></italic>]. Thereby, OBRs can, potentially, be minimized helping to suppress halo-artifacts, at least around the bladder.</p><p>For the patient data, we used standard MR-derived attenuation maps, which neglect bone attenuation and often suffer from truncation, since the patients are usually scanned with their arms down as they were in our study. Two recent publications demonstrated that compensating for or avoiding arm truncation significantly improves the appearance of halo-artifacts in <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></italic>]. However, both studies show that halo-artifacts may still be present, even when MLAA-based attenuation maps are employed [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></italic>] or when patients are scanned with their arms up [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></italic>]. We therefore expect that the results for the default MaxSF = 75% will improve significantly in terms of halo-artifact suppression if some truncation correction method, such as MLAA-based attenuation maps [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></italic>] or HUGE [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></italic>], is applied, especially in combination with relative scatter scaling (tail-fitting technique). Additional benefits with regard to halo-artifacts may be possible when using attenuation maps including bone information, e.g., derived from atlas-based methods [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></italic>]. However, the results of the phantom experiments suggest that inaccurate and especially truncated MR-based attenuation maps are not the only reason for halo-artifacts (an untruncated, CT-derived attenuation map was used for the phantom measurements). In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g009">Fig 9</xref> shows one example of a patient included in the present study, where detruncation of the attenuation map was not sufficient to entirely correct for halo-artifacts. For this example, detruncation was done manually by segmenting the arms in the non-attenuation-corrected PET images and assigning the corresponding voxels in the attenuation map with values corresponding to water.</p><fig id="pone.0183329.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183329.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Effect of arm truncation on halo-artifact appearance.</title><p>Attenuation maps and corresponding PET images of a clinical case acquired with a Biograph mMR in coronal slice orientation. In the standard MR-based attenuation maps, arms are truncated. Detruncation of the arms in the attenuation map significantly reduces the size of the halo-artifact for the applied relative (Rel) scaling. Additional prompt gamma correction (PGC) further reduces the halo-size but cannot completely compensate for the artifact, which potentially masks lesions in close vicinity to the bladder. For comparison, the reconstruction obtained with absolute scatter scaling and MaxSF = 40% is shown, which results in a complete halo-artifact suppression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0183329.g009"/></fig><p>Ruling out several potential causes as single or main reason for halo-artifacts in <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI (prompt gammas, truncated and inaccurate attenuation maps, non-TOF information) it remains open, what other causes for halo-artifacts are present. The implemented SSS algorithm does not explicitly model scatter events caused by activity outside the FOV. However, for the phantom experiments, the entire activity was within the FOV, both in transaxial and axial direction. This suggests that out-of-FOV activity is also to be ruled out as remaining main or single reason for halo-artifacts (although some effect cannot be excluded). Our phantom experiments did not provide any insight into the effect of multiple scatter. Including multiple scatter into the scatter estimation model would change both the shape and magnitude of the obtained scatter estimates and potentially improve halo-artifact appearance. Therefore, scatter correction algorithms explicitly treating multiple scatter should be investigated and, if proven valuable, should be made available in clinical practice.</p><p>For the phantom and patient data investigated in this study, both quantitative and visual evaluation showed that the default scatter correction variants, i.e., Rel75 (default for, e.g., <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET/MRI) and Abs75 (default for <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI) do not sufficiently suppress halo-artifacts. Additionally, it was shown that reducing the maximum scatter fraction from MaxSF = 75% to MaxSF = 40% is highly beneficial to significantly reduce halo-artifacts, as visualized in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g008">8</xref>, and summarized in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183329.t002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183329.t003">3</xref>. Further reduction of the maximum scatter fraction to 30% or lower resulted in a scatter underestimation for most data sets, apparent as locally increased activity values surrounding the bladder or the kidneys in the reconstructed PET images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Overall, both the quantitative and qualitative evaluation showed that a combination of the absolute variant of SSS with MaxSF = 40% (Abs40) resulted in the best halo-artifact suppression, both for the bladder and the kidneys. However, it should be considered that modifying MaxSF does not only affect the visual appearance and quantification in the region affected by halo-artifacts but throughout the entire image. As demonstrated by the lesion quantification experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183329.t001">Table 1</xref>), the effect on the background region, however, is significantly lower than on the halo-region. Nevertheless, it may be beneficial to consider images reconstructed with MaxSF = 75% alongside with those corresponding to MaxSF = 40% to ensure proper quantification both in the background as well as in regions affected by halo-artifacts.</p><p>As stated in the materials and methods section, reducing MaxSF changes the downscaling of the estimated scatter. Similarly, one could use an additional scaling factor <italic>f</italic> &#x0003c; 1.0 to reduce the magnitude of the estimated scatter (in fact, such a parameter is available with the Siemens e7tools; default value: 1.0). However, such a scaling would apply to all patients, regardless of the initial scatter fraction, whereas reducing MaxSF only changes the magnitude of the scatter if it is above the threshold specified by MaxSF. In other words, adjusting MaxSF is more flexible since it does not result in a downscaling of the scatter for patients with scatter fractions below MaxSF, and thus for cases which most likely do not suffer from halo-artifacts.</p><p>While the results presented in this work clearly demonstrate that reducing MaxSF improves image quality in terms of halo-artifacts and also improves quantification in the affected regions, the optimal choice of MaxSF is not so obvious. Our choice MaxSF = 40% was motivated by previously published studies estimating the scatter fraction based on phantom measurements [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></italic>&#x02013;<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></italic>], Monte Carlo simulations [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></italic>], and estimations on patient data [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></italic>,<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></italic>&#x02013;<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></italic>]. The chosen value proved to work well for the phantom data and for all 31 patient data sets presented in this study. However, it should also be obvious that a single value for MaxSF may not reflect large differences in size across patients. For larger patients, higher values of MaxSF may be better suited to correct for halo-artifacts while at the same time minimizing the effect of the modified scatter scaling to other body regions. A similar idea was presented by Rezaei et al. at the last MIC conference, suggesting a plane-dependent scaling of the scatter estimate obtained by SSS, with the scaling parameters being chosen such that the likelihood function is maximized [<italic><xref rid="pone.0183329.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></italic>].</p><p>The clinical examples presented in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g008">8</xref> demonstrate that halo-artifacts significantly influence the image appearance and, thus, the diagnosis. If the uptake of the pathological structure is very faint, it may be masked by halo-artifacts whereas high uptakes are usually detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Only in 1 out of 31 patients, a pathological lesion completely vanished in the default Abs75 reconstruction compared to the proposed Abs40. However, uptake values vary considerably, decrease with increasing size of the halo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183329.g008">Fig 8</xref>), and thus substantiate the necessity for correcting halo-artifacts to improve quantification in the affected regions. To avoid false-negative diagnoses caused by scatter-correction induced halo-artifacts, improved scatter correction methods producing halo-artifact-free PET images independent of the clinical workflow in <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI are mandatory. Our presented workaround based on a reduced maximum scatter fraction does not entirely solve the problem of halo-artifacts because it does not target the underlying problem of inaccurate scatter estimation. However, it significantly improves the image quality in terms of halo-artifact suppression and thus helps to improve scientific and clinical evaluation. Images reconstructed with a reduced maximum scatter fraction, e.g., MaxSF = 40%, should be made available in clinical practice and considered in cases were halo-artifacts are present, potentially alongside with images corresponding to the default MaxSF = 75%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec031"><title>Conclusion</title><p><sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI is prone to halo-artifacts surrounding the bladder and the kidneys, which are caused by improper scatter correction and appear with increasing OBR over time. Because their appearance may be detrimental to image interpretation and thus patient diagnosis, strategies to avoid halo-artifacts are recommended. Besides striving for low OBRs we recommend reducing the maximum scatter fraction from 75% to 40% for the currently implemented SSS algorithm, which was shown to efficiently suppress halo-artifacts in all investigated cases. This parameter modification may serve as ad-hoc method to enable clinical <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI in patients where halo-artifacts are present until a more accurate scatter correction technique becomes available in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We appreciate the excellent support of our medical physicist Dr. Stefan Kegel and our technicians Rene Hertel, Regula Gnirs, Heike Streib-Retzbach, and Cora Weyrich.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0183329.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pellicer</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fair</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Heston</surname><given-names>WWD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cordon-Cardo</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>. <article-title>Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in normal and malignant human tissues</article-title>. <source>Clin Cancer Res</source>. <year>1997</year>;<volume>3</volume>:<fpage>81</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>85</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9815541</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0183329.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sweat</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pacelli</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bostwick</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name>. <article-title>Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression is greatest in prostate adenocarcinoma and lymph node metastases</article-title>. <source>Urology</source>. <year>1998</year>;<volume>52</volume>:<fpage>637</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>640</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9763084</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0183329.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Eder</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Eisenhut</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Babich</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Haberkorn</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name>. <article-title>PSMA as a target for radiolabelled small molecules</article-title>. <source>Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging</source>. <year>2013</year>;<volume>40</volume>:<fpage>819</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>823</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-013-2374-2">10.1007/s00259-013-2374-2</ext-link></comment>
