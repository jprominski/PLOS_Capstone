Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapy for refractory or recurrent CDAD and, despite safety concerns, has recently been offered to immunocompromised patients. We investigated the genomics of bacterial composition following FMT in immunocompromised patients over a 1-year period. Metagenomic, strain and gene-level bacterial dynamics were characterized in two CDAD-affected hematopoietic stem cell (HCT) recipients following FMT. We found alterations in gene content, including loss of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. These alterations were accompanied by long-term bacterial divergence at the species and strain levels. Our findings suggest limited durability of the specific bacterial consortium introduced with FMT and indicate that alterations of the functional potential of the microbiome are more complex than can be inferred by taxonomic information alone. Our observation that FMT alone cannot induce long-term donor-like alterations of the microbiota of HCT recipients suggests that FMT cannot indefinitely supersede environmental and/or host factors in shaping bacterial composition.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation (US)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhatt</surname><given-names>Ami S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA184420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhatt</surname><given-names>Ami S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (nsfgrfp.org) DGE-114747 awarded to ELM; American Society of Hematology (hematology.org) Scholar and Amy Strelzer Manasevit (National Marrow Donor Program (bethematch.org)) award to ASB; National Cancer Institute (cancer.gov) K08 CA184420 to ASB., and the Thomas C. and Joan M.

Among immunocompromised populations at greatest risk of developing CDAD are hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, who experience attack rates as high as 25%, and who are up to nine times more likely to suffer from CDAD than immunocompetent individuals [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A small number of recent studies have reported that FMT can safely resolve CDAD in post-HCT recipients [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, persisting concerns regarding the safety of administering FMT therapy to immunocompromised patients continue to limit use of the therapy in post-HCT individuals. Better understanding the effects of FMT through investigations of post-treatment gut bacterial community structure in immunocompromised patients is needed.</p><p>Several studies leveraging 16S rRNA gene sequencing have begun to reveal the taxonomic underpinnings of FMT therapy by informing on genus- and species-level bacterial dynamics. These studies have demonstrated that FMT induces taxonomic compositional changes in the recipient gut microbiota, resulting in a more donor-like state [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These analyses have provided a foundation for metagenomic investigation of FMT: there are good reasons for considering whole genomes and strain-level diversity, since bacterial strains with identical 16S rRNA sequences can exhibit wide variability in terms of phenotype and pathogenicity resulting from nucleotide level DNA sequence differences or differing gene content. For example, commensal <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are abundant facultative anaerobes in the human gut [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], yet enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are important pathogens. A recent study of patients undergoing FMT for treatment of metabolic syndrome was the first to report strain-level dynamics after FMT. In this study of 10 patients, the investigators found that strains of donor bacteria are capable of both replacing and coexisting with same-species recipient strains at three months post-FMT [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These findings are intriguing, but questions remain regarding the generalizability of this finding to patients undergoing FMT for treatment of CDAD where, unlike the metabolic syndrome cohort, patients receive antibiotics prior to FMT and have an underlying dysbiosis. In the setting of prior antibiotic therapy, it is presumed that the total amount and diversity of microorganisms present in the FMT recipient is lower, and thus the gut may represent a relatively barren ecological niche for repopulation with donor-derived microbes. Additionally, no studies have yet reported on strain level engraftment at time points greater than three months after FMT.</p><p>To date, the collective understanding of FMT impact on the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota has been defined by studies of immunocompetent patients. However, as immunocompromised patients are at greatest risk of developing CDAD, there is much to gain from an investigation of FMT in this patient population, in which the impaired host immune system may have diminished influence on the gut microbiota community. Further, although the recent studies relating the success of FMT in immunocompromised individuals have begun to assuage concerns of safety [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], those concerns are not unfounded [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Characterizing the taxonomic and functional capacity of the immunocompromised patient microbiota post-FMT carries potential for both improving clinical outcomes of CDAD in patients lacking a robust immune system and advancing our understanding of the human microbiota landscape during transitions between states of health and disease.</p><p>We present eight HCT patients with three or more microbiologically-documented CDAD episodes, all of whom were successfully treated with FMT. For two of these patients, we were able to perform a longitudinal study of microbiota dynamics, employing shotgun metagenomic sequencing of serial stool samples obtained before, immediately after and over one year following FMT. We show that recipient stool assumed donor-like taxonomic and functional composition immediately following FMT, but that functional and taxonomic concordance were diminished after one year. These findings suggest that environmental, lifestyle and other host-factors are important determinants in long-term shaping of the microbiota. Furthermore, we show that despite the divergence of overall taxonomic and functional similarity at &#x0003e;1 year post-FMT, potentially important specific changes to the gene repertoire were retained, including the loss of pathogenicity genes from the pan-genome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and a reduction of community-wide antibiotic-resistance genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Treatment outcomes of FMT in eight HCT patients</title><p>FMT was delivered as an oral, encapsulated therapy using stool from a healthy unrelated donor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182585.t001">Table 1</xref>). All eight of the HCT patients to receive FMT experienced resolution of CDAD at 8 weeks, a standard time frame for determining cure. Subjects G and H died of underlying CNS disease and intracranial hemorrhage at 208 and 101 days following FMT, respectively. Both subjects were negative for CDAD at the time of death. Subjects A, B, C, E and F were free of CDAD at time of final stool sample collection at 408, 384, 456, 448 and 410 days post-FMT, respectively. Subject D experienced a recurrence of CDAD, and tested positive for CDAD at time of final stool sample collection, 179 days post-FMT. FMT is typically performed in patients with CDAD after significant clinical improvement is achieved with antimicrobial therapy. Subject B had active diarrhea at the time of FMT; the remaining five subjects were symptomatically quiescent.

Sample collection for Subjects A and B was performed as follows: a single stool sample was obtained immediately before FMT; four stool samples were collected within a short-term period following FMT (on days 6, 14, 16 and 21 for Subject A; and days 6, 8, 13 and 20 for Subject B); and one stool sample was obtained at a long-term timepoint post FMT (days 408 and 384 for Subjects A and B, respectively). We also performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of one long-term post-FMT sample from subjects C, D, E and F; pre-FMT samples were not available for these individuals. Long-term samples for subjects G and H were not collected as subjects were deceased at time of collection. Samples immediately pre-FMT and within 21 days post-FMT were not available for Subjects C, D, E, F, G and H.</p><p>In order to draw parallels between our results and the majority of FMT metagenomic studies to date, we began with an investigation of bacterial composition following FMT at the level of genus, a level of resolution typically targeted with the common approach of 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis.

Although donor-concordant patterns of engraftment were found to be sustained for all short-term samples (&#x0003c;21 days), compositional similarity was largely diminished in the long-term (&#x0003e;1 year) timepoints for both Subjects A and B.</p><fig id="pone.0182585.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182585.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Genus-level taxonomic composition reveals extensive short-term donor microbial engraftment with FMT, followed by long-term reduction in donor similarity relative to donor self-similarity over a similar time period.</title><p>Genera present in the donor appear in (a) Subject A and (b) Subject B recipients with inconsistent long-term residence.

However, at &#x0003e;1 year post-FMT, donor similarity was reduced beyond the range of variability observed in donor self-similarity. As a point of comparison, we also calculated donor self-similarity using multiple stool samples taken over 180 days from donor #29, who provided fecal samples for all subjects aside from D, G and H. Donor self-similarity was calculated as similarity across the donor time series to the initial timepoint. At the taxonomic level, donor self-similarity fluctuated by as much as 33%, though at the level of gene, variations in donor self-similarity were minimal (within 1%). Although stool sampled immediately pre-FMT and within a month post-FMT were not collected for Subjects C, D, E, F, G or H, we were able to obtain samples for Subjects C, E and F at &#x0003e;1 year post-FMT, and for Subject D at ~6 months following FMT.

The success of FMT in resolving CDAD in HCT patients has been demonstrated previously [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], however a detailed characterization of this &#x0201c;black box&#x0201d; therapy has been lacking. We used a shotgun metagenomic approach to examine both short- and long-term bacterial engraftment following FMT to treat CDAD in HCT patients. We show that although concordance was observed between microbiota composition of the donor and recipient in the short-term, concordance was reduced after 1 year. Previous studies investigating long-term donor similarity have been confined to immunocompetent individuals and have either (1) been limited to 16S rRNA sequencing analysis [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or (2) observed strain-level changes, but only through to three months following FMT. [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the case of the 16S rRNA studies, Broecker et al. [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] investigated family donor FMT in one subject, and reported long-term (&#x0003e;4.5 years) donor similarity but limited short-term (&#x0003c;7 months) concordance. Conversely, we observed short-term similarity and long-term donor discordance. For all eight HCT patients in our study, recipients received stool from a healthy, unrelated donor, in contrast to the method employed by Broecker et al, where fecal material was donated by the sister of the FMT recipient. Our findings that unrelated donors and recipients display dissimilar microbiota profiles at long-term timepoints post-FMT suggest that FMT engraftment is broadly impacted by external effects such as diet, host genetics, host immune surveillance, and subsequent antibiotic exposure. These factors may supersede FMT composition in determining long-term FMT durability.</p><p>Also employing 16S rRNA sequencing were studies by 1) Jalanka et al., who used FMT from &#x0201c;universal donors&#x0201d; to treat CDAD in 14 immunocompetent patients, and report on bacterial composition through to 1 year following FMT [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]Weingarden et al., who followed taxonomic changes for 151 days post-FMT from 4 immunocompetent CDAD-afflicted subjects treated with stool from a single donor. [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Like Broecker et al., Jalanka et al. found the unrelated donor bacterial profile to be retained in recipients at 1 year post-FMT. However, Weingarden et al. report the highest similarity between donor and recipient to be 1 day following FMT, with considerable divergence at all later time points. Such findings are more consistent with our observations of short-term similarity and long-term dissimilarity between donor and recipient gut microbiota composition. We attribute the respective discrepancy between the findings of Broecker and Jalanka with those of Weingarden and ourselves to differences in sensitivity between 16S and metagenomic methodologies, and to possible involvement of the host immune status and potential subsequent therapies in influencing the long-term fate of donor microbiota.</p><p>Our analysis of nucleotide-level similarity between donor and recipient, adapted from Li et al [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], showed donor concordance over short-term timepoints consistent with that group&#x02019;s findings, however after 1 year post-FMT we report high discordance between donor and recipient genus Roseburia SNVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182585.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We focused on this genus since it appeared to be absent in the recipient pre-FMT, abundant in both the donor and the recipient at all timepoints post-FMT, and showed the highest abundance of reads at &#x0003e;1 year post-FMT. Given the consistent presence of Roseburia across all timepoints, it was surprising that the genomic sequence(s) of Roseburia at &#x0003e;1 year post-FMT was extensively dissimilar to that of the Roseburia organism(s) that had initially engrafted in the recipient. It is possible that intra-species competition, neutral drift, or other mechanisms of nucleotide divergence drove strain turnover within the ecological niche harbouring Roseburia; however, more studies are needed to understand the importance of sub-species interactions and how such fluctuations might affect gut microbiome behavior and ultimately human health.</p><p>To gain a better appreciation for how gene-level differences between same-species strains of bacteria affect engraftment following FMT, we chose to investigate the gene complement of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, a species that exhibits wide variability between strains, ranging from dominant commensal in the human gut to highly virulent pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We chose this organism both because it occurs at high abundance through the time series obtained from Subject A, and because there is an extensive genome collection available for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. At the taxonomic level, the presence of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was consistent in Subject A throughout all samples; however, at the gene level, we observed massive losses and gains in the total <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> accessory genome between all measured timepoints, with the most pronounced differences occurring pre- and post-FMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182585.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Whether this change is due to strain replacement or genomic remodeling within a single resident strain is unconfirmed, although the rapid timeframe in which it occurs suggests the former.</p><p>Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are becoming increasingly common in patients with hematological malignancies, such as HCT recipients [<xref rid="pone.0182585.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Due presumably to both the requirement that antibiotic treatment be administered for at least 3 CDAD episodes before FMT will be attempted, as well as the use of antibiotics in conjunction with HCT therapy, recipients have been found to have higher numbers of antibiotic resistance genes than those of healthy donors. We sought to determine (1) whether immunocompromised patients carry an increased number of antibiotic resistance genes compared to a healthy donor, and (2) if FMT is similarly capable of reducing the abundance and variety of antibiotic resistance genes in HCT patients. We demonstrate that, for the immunocompromised subjects analyzed, there was an increased presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the recipient compared to the donor, and that abundance of the antibiotic resistome was reduced by &#x0003e;50% followed FMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182585.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Furthermore, this reduction persisted more than one year after FMT. This is consistent with findings in immunocompetent recipients, and bodes well for the potential reduction of antibiotic resistance via FMT in HCT patients. Given the lean toolkit of antibiotics that remain effective in the face of MDR pathogens, identifying strategies to mitigate antibiotic resistance is of tremendous importance, especially for immunocompromised individuals. Reducing antibiotic resistance may prove to be yet another potential application of FMT.</p><p>In conclusion, our work establishes a foundation for future studies employing a shotgun metagenomic approach to better understand the evolution of microbial communities after FMT in various disease states. We demonstrate that granular shotgun metagenomic analyses show high initial donor similarity and long-term donor divergence at the community-wide taxonomic and functional levels, as well as in single-species gene composition and nucleotide variation. While further studies involving a larger cohort of patients and more detailed statistical analysis are necessary to validate our early findings, the findings reported herein lend support to the safe use of FMT for CDAD and reveal preliminary evidence for short and long-term FMT dynamics in immunocompromised HCT patients. In addition, our results strongly support the value of detailed analysis of metagenomic sequence data, and suggest a holistic model of FMT engraftment durability informed by more than donor or recipient microbiome taxonomic composition at the species, genus or phylum level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Stool sample collection</title><p>Bone marrow transplant recipient fecal samples were collected by patients at home using collection kits provided.
