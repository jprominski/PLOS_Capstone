Metabolic cooperativity in these systems can arise due to the subtle interplay between microenvironmental conditions and the cells&#x02019; regulatory machinery, often involving cascades of intra- and extracellular signalling molecules. In the simplest of cases, as demonstrated in a recent study of the model organism <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, metabolic cross-feeding can arise in monoclonal colonies of bacteria driven merely by spatial heterogeneity in the availability of growth substrates; namely, acetate, glucose and oxygen. Another recent study demonstrated that even closely related <italic>E. coli</italic> strains evolved different glucose utilization and acetate production capabilities, hinting at the possibility of subtle differences in metabolic cooperativity and the resulting growth behavior of these organisms. Taking a first step towards understanding the complex spatio-temporal interactions within microbial populations, we performed a parametric study of <italic>E. coli</italic> growth on an agar substrate and probed the dependence of colony behavior on: 1) strain-specific metabolic characteristics, and 2) the geometry of the underlying substrate. To do so, we employed a recently developed multiscale technique named 3D dynamic flux balance analysis which couples reaction-diffusion simulations with iterative steady-state metabolic modeling. Key measures examined include colony growth rate and shape (height vs. width), metabolite production/consumption and concentration profiles, and the emergence of metabolic cooperativity and the fractions of cell phenotypes. Five closely related strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>, which exhibit large variation in glucose consumption and organic acid production potential, were studied. The onset of metabolic cooperativity was found to vary substantially between these five strains by up to 10 hours and the relative fraction of acetate utilizing cells within the colonies varied by a factor of two. Additionally, growth with six different geometries designed to mimic those that might be found in a laboratory, a microfluidic device, and inside a living organism were considered. Geometries were found to have complex, often nonlinear effects on colony growth and cross-feeding with &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; features resulting in larger effect than &#x0201c;soft&#x0201d; features. These results demonstrate that strain-specific features and spatial constraints imposed by the growth substrate can have significant effects even for microbial populations as simple as isogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1144245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0989-5288</contrib-id><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Joseph R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000086</institution-id><institution>Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1430124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luthey-Schulten</surname><given-names>Zaida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM112659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luthey-Schulten</surname><given-names>Zaida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9 P41 GM104601-23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luthey-Schulten</surname><given-names>Zaida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNA13AA91A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luthey-Schulten</surname><given-names>Zaida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant DGE-1144245 (to J.R.P.), by the National Institutes of Health Grants GM112659 and 9 P41 GM104601-23, by NSF (Center for the Physics of Living Cells) Grant PHY-1430124, and by NASA Grant no.

Whether it be the division of labor among the cells in an animal body or the complex chemical warfare among a soup of bacteria competing for limited resources, spatial and temporal variation are key factors which must be understood. Interactions in microbial communities, which often comprise tens to hundreds of metabolically distinct species [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], are of particular interest in areas ranging from human health [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to ecology of the world&#x02019;s nutrient cycles [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182570.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These communities form complex networks of cooperative and competitive interactions that ultimately determine the population&#x02019;s dynamics, steady-states, and robustness to change [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, it is now known that among people with chronic bowel diseases, the composition of the gut microbiota can vary considerably relative to the &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; patient [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182570.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. More generally, the potential for emergent metabolic cooperativity via a wide array of organic acids, inorganic molecules, salts, and purine/pyrimidines have been predicted in two-member bacterial communities [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Underlying the stability and structure of these populations are a complex network of metabolic and physical interactions that vary both spatially and temporally [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; thus, part of what is needed to understand how these populations behave is an understanding of the metabolism of community members growing alone and in concert with their neighbors.</p><p>A number of computational systems biology techniques have been developed for understanding the growth and metabolic requirements of different microbes. Chief among these is a family of methods based on flux balance analysis (FBA) [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. FBA describes the steady-state growth and fluxes within an organism&#x02019;s metabolic network subject to internal constraints (<italic>e.g</italic>. reaction upper bounds proceeding from the finite copy numbers of catalytic enzymes and their turnover rates) and external constraints (<italic>e.g</italic>. limited availability of a molecule needed for growth). Several FBA methods designed to examine communities of microorganisms have been developed including community FBA (cFBA), OptCom, dynamic multi-scale FBA (dmsFBA) and population FBA [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182570.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. cFBA compartmentalizes different organisms but allows them to compete for and exchange metabolites through an extracellular compartment [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. OptCom uses a similar technique, however it allows for a community objective to be defined, which enables users to identify optimal engineering strategies for a community [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. dmsFBA relaxes the common steady-state assumption in order to simulate how cross-feeding evolves with time [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Population FBA simulates metabolic phenotypes in populations of microbes that arise due to capacity constraints that arise from stochastic gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For an excellent review of these and other community methods and studies, see [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All of these methods are limited in that they treat the entire population as being &#x0201c;well-stirred&#x0201d;, that is, seeing the same chemical and spatial environment. This may be a reasonable approximation for some problems (e.g. bioreactors), but spatial heterogeneity is innate to many important scenarios (<italic>e.g</italic>. biofilms, microbiome).</p><p>A recently developed multi-scale systems biology technique provides a means to examine the spatial dependence of microbial growth. Named 3-dimensional dynamic flux balance analysis (3DdFBA) [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], this method solves a reaction-diffusion equation on a lattice, allowing chemicals to diffuse in and among various phases (<italic>i.e</italic>. solid, liquid, gas, cell, <italic>etc</italic>.) and be taken up by cells living in a given lattice site, effectively converting chemicals into biomass. The method has been formulated with both stochastic [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182570.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and continuous [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] descriptions of the reaction and diffusion of the chemical species. The stochastic version of the method was applied to small colonies (&#x0223c;100 cells) of <italic>E. coli</italic> growing in a micro-aerobic environment [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182570.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These simulations suggested that metabolic cooperativity could arise in an isogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> population, which in turn prompted the development of a continuous version capable of simulating macroscopic colonies [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Laboratory scale simulations of <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies growing on 2.5% glucose minimal media predicted that after sufficient time the population would fractionate into glucose-utilizing cells that ferment acetate, and acetate-utilizing cells which are starved of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A number of other spatially-resolved FBA methods have also been developed, and used to study mutualism and competition in two dimensional multispecies communities (COMETS; [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) as well as chronic wound biofilm homoeostasis (DFBALab; [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182570.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]).</p><fig id="pone.0182570.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182570.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Metabolic crossfeeding in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</title><p>A visualization of a 3DdFBA simulation of metabolic cooperativity in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 growing on a 2.5% glucose agar substrate (described previously [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). The image depicts metabolic cooperativity between aerobic (purple) and anaerobic (red) glucose utilizing cells, which generate acetate that is utilized aerobically by glucose starved cells (green).

As a demonstration of their utility for complex 3D geometries, we performed parametric studies of metabolic cross-feeding using 3DdFBA in: 1) colonies of closely related <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, and 2) colonies grown on agars with geometries other than merely flat surfaces. We also analyze the error resulting from the discretization of the reaction-diffusion equation and show that grids finer than 20 &#x003bc;m are required to ensure converged solutions. Our simulations demonstrate that 3DdFBA can predict significant effects on the dynamics of microbial populations that arise through subtle differences between strains. Finally, we show that while abrupt changes in the shape of a colony&#x02019;s substrate (<italic>i.e</italic>. the existence of a nearby wall of agar) can dramatically impact the colony&#x02019;s growth, more subtle curvatures (such as those that may arise within the gut) give rise to growth dynamics that are very similar to reference colonies grown on flat agar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>3DdFBA</title><p>Three dimensional dynamic flux balance analysis (3DdFBA) is only briefly reviewed here, as it was described rigorously previously [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

We examined how several features of interest (<italic>e.g</italic>. fluxes, chemical concentrations, and cellular phenotypes) differ across a range of grid resolutions.</p><p>As a test system, we simulated the previously published <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 model [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] at eight grid resolutions ranging from 4.1 to 120 &#x003bc;m. Each colony simulation was seeded with the equivalent of a single cell&#x02019;s mass on the surface of the agar in the center of the simulation domain. Growth of the resulting colony was simulated for 40 hours to allow sufficient metabolic cooperativity to arise. Colonies grew to fill the agar and began to interact with the simulation boundary conditions at about 35 hours of growth. After this simulations began to exhibit boundary effects due to the use of fixed-concentration (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. Therefore, the resolution dependence was examined at the 30 hour time-point before any significant boundary effects arose.</p><p>We examine first the resolution dependence of the chemical concentration profiles within the colony; this particular feature is important in driving the partitioning of community members into different metabolic phenotypes during the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Profiles taken through the colony&#x02019;s central axis show that the concentration profiles sharpen and the colony height narrows as finer grid resolutions are employed (compare profiles between &#x02212;0.2 and 0.4 depth). This spreading as the resolution is coarsened allows the acetate utilizing fraction of the colony to grow more quickly and to a larger overall fraction of the total colony composition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g004">Fig 4a</xref>). The acetate concentration profile is especially illustrative of the resolution dependence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g003">Fig 3</xref> (right), showing how the structure changes as the resolution is coarsened.

As no analytical solution to the problem is known, we compute the error relative to the finest grid resolution simulation (<italic>i.e</italic>. 4.1 &#x003bc;m). The average relative error was computed over the period from 10 to 30 hours of growth as this is when the initial expansion and differentiation occurs in the colony.

Our results show that in order to simulate processes in which the reaction to diffusion ratios of metabolites are similar to those of glucose and acetate, finer grid resolutions must be used. While we did not study the resolution dependence of any of the previous studies, our results suggest that at least some of them may not have been simulated at a resolution adequate to ensure reasonably converged results. Nevertheless, we note that our results are for a colony growing at the boundary of two different phases (<italic>i.e</italic>. agar/cells and air), one of which occludes certain metabolites, and that the convergence characteristics might therefore be different from previous studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title><italic>E. coli</italic> strain-dependent features of acetate cross-feeding</title><p>Different <italic>E. coli</italic> strains have evolved different glucose utilization rates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182570.t001">Table 1</xref>), presumably due to some environmental (or engineered, in the case of commercial strains) stress. While aerobic and anaerobic growth rates were highly correlated with glucose utilization rates (p&#x0003c;0.05 and p&#x0003c;0.02, respectively), the aerobic and anaerobic growth rates were not significantly correlated (p&#x0003e;0.19). Guessing what cross-feeding behavior will arise due to these differences is nontrivial. To complicate the issue, two of the strains produce acetate via overflow metabolism when grown aerobically, the rates of which are uncorrelated with the acetate production rate when grown anaerobically.</p><p>We hypothesized these differences could give rise to strain-specific cross-feeding features which 3DdFBA simulations could predict. Models for each of the organisms were obtained from the BiGG database [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and fit to measured aerobic and anaerobic growth and acetate secretion rates [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The fit models exhibited very low error in the growth and aerobic acetate secretion rates and moderate error in anaerobic acetate production rates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182570.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref> for a detailed analysis of the models). Each strain was simulated on a flat agar surface with identical initial conditions for 50 hours of growth with a grid resolution of 10 &#x003bc;m to ensure a converged answer.</p><p>Overall, colonies grew at different rates due primarily to their differences in substrate utilization rates. Generally, glucose diffusing up through the agar was depleted by the cells growing at the periphery and bottom of the colony, while oxygen diffusing in from above was predominantly consumed by those at the top of the colony (producing an anoxic zone with little growth at the colony center). Heatmaps depicting concentrations and fluxes of the major metabolites in a slice through the colony center can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182570.s002">S2 Fig</xref> The structure of the actively growing cells (depicted by high metabolic flux in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182570.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) are generally the same, though several significant differences can be seen (for instance, compare oxygen and glucose uptake rates for strains W3110 and BL21). Counter-intuitively, height to width ratios of the colonies varied by at most 22% early on, and settled down to a maximum difference of 12% (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182570.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Acetate cross-feeding naturally arose in simulations of all <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g005">Fig 5</xref>). While the structural profiles of the colony (<italic>i.e</italic>. the spatial arrangement of acetate to glucose utilizing populations) were similar among the strains, several features did vary significantly. Specifically, the timing of the onset of the cross-feeding and the partitioning of the colony members into metabolic phenotypes differed significantly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g005">Fig 5</xref>; top left). The timing of the emergence of an acetate utilizing fraction varied by &#x0223c;10 hours, ranging from 15 to 25 hours after inoculation. This time appears to primarily be set by the rate of aerobic growth on glucose (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182570.s007">S1 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182570.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This can be understood simply to be a matter of how much time is required for the colony to grow tall enough such that the glucose entering the bottom is metabolised before it reaches the top. Partitioning among the metabolic cooperators also shows a high degree of strain dependence. After the onset of metabolic cooperativity, the acetate utilizing fraction of the population quickly rises to some (nearly) steady-state. Acetate utiliziers were found to comprise between 5 and 10% of the colony by volume (of which &#x0223c;70% are actually consuming acetate). The Crooks <italic>E. coli</italic> strain had the largest fraction of acetate utilizers while the W3110 strain had the smallest fraction. The other three strains had similar acetate utilizing fractions of about 6 and 7%. Quantitatively, the strains shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g005">Fig 5</xref> have significantly different chemical turnover; for instance Crooks (W3110) has &#x0223c;40% higher (lower) acetate turnover after accounting for differences in colony volume (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182570.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0182570.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182570.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Strain dependence of crossfeeding.</title><p>Differences in metabolite utilization efficiency of closely related <italic>E. coli</italic> strains give rise to differences in metabolic cross-feeding. Cross-sections of the acetate utilizing volume fraction of cells after 30 hours of growth show that, while the colony growth rates are slightly different, the structure of the metabolic cross-feeding is essentially the same (heatmaps). A quantification of colony volume, however, shows that the fraction of colony that utilize acetate can vary by a factor of 2 and the timing for onset of metabolic cooperativity can vary by up to 10 hours (top left). The acetate utilizing fraction are cells that have transitioned into the phenotypic state where they can catabolize acetate; while these cells are not necessarily consuming acetate, they have the capacity to do so. In general, about 70% of these cells are consuming acetate and are doing so at the maximum uptake rate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0182570.g005"/></fig><p>To identify the sources of differences between strains, correlations were computed between various strain-dependent characteristics and both the maximum acetate utilizing fraction and the onset time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182570.s007">S1 Table</xref>). We found that the onset time and overall acetate fraction were set by qualitatively different strain features. Specifically, the onset time was primarily controlled by the maximal aerobic growth rate (with faster-growing strains having earlier onset times), while the overall acetate utilizing fraction was only weakly correlated with the aerobic and anaerobic growth rates. The acetate utilizing fraction turned out to be highly anti-correlated with the maximal acetate uptake rate. In essence, the onset time depends on how quickly the colony grows large enough to have an anoxic region in the interior, while the thickness of the acetate utilizing fraction depends on how much of the colony is acetate-rich, which in turn depends on how fast cells deplete the available acetate. We found that gene expression values for malate dehydrogenase (mdh), succinyl-CoA synthettase (sucCD), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (sucAB) were correlated with anaerobic flux values through their reactions (a similar result was identified in [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), and could be the sources of differences in growth rates and acetate production rates in the different strains. More practically, we found that the overall acetate production rate (<italic>i.e</italic>. loss of acetate to the environment) was highly correlated with the acetate utilizing fraction.</p><p>Subtle differences in strain growth, when considered in the context of microbial communities, could give rise to drastically different population dynamics. For instance, competition for acetate with another microbe could be drastically affected by the onset time for metabolic cross-feeding. Additionally, partitioning of the colony into different phenotypes could effect its robustness to environmental changes or stresses. While we did not study these effects here, it is clear that the 3DdFBA methodology could be used for their investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Geometry dependence of acetate cross-feeding</title><p>The cross-feeding behavior in <italic>E. coli</italic> depends on characteristics intrinsic to the particular strain (<italic>i.e</italic>. growth rate, maximum uptake and efflux rates, metabolic efficiency, <italic>etc</italic>.) as well as interactions with the environment (<italic>i.e</italic>. structural confinement and availability of nutrients).

This acetate fraction grows significantly faster than the one seen in flat surface colonies, and leads to a larger overall acetate volume fraction by about 25%. The formation of this second fraction is due primarily to the large build-up of acetate in the center of the colony. A similar effect is seen in the hole geometry discussed later.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Hole and plateau</title><p>Colonies growing on the top of plateaus and at the bottom of holes exhibit the most complex dynamics of any in this study.

The duration and extent of this transient drop in acetate utilixing fraction depends strongly on the aspect ratio of the plateau; wider plateaus exhibit more moderate transients (less of a dip, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g008">Fig 8</xref>; bottom). Wider plateaus also exhibit faster growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g008">Fig 8</xref> top), primarily due to the longer expansion time before having to grow around the edge.</p><fig id="pone.0182570.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182570.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Plateau geometry.</title><p>Plots of total colony volume (top) and fraction of acetate utilizers (bottom) for colonies grown on plateaus of agar 0.2 (left) and 0.4 (right) mm in height.

This is quite apparent from examining images of the simulations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182570.g006">Fig 6</xref>). When grown on plateaus, the limitation of glucose causes the large acetate utilizing fraction of cells near the column. It is easy to imagine how more complex arrangements of plateaus and holes will exhibit even more complex dynamics.

Using 3DdFBA, a multi-scale method coupling reaction-diffusion with FBA, we were able to elucidate subtle differences in the growth and metabolic cross-feeding of colonies growing on various agar surfaces due to varying initial conditions. Three observations are particularly important for future studies.</p><p>First, by examining the dependence of the solution on grid resolution we determined that a lattice spacing of &#x0223c;10 &#x003bc;m (or smaller) is required to ensure a converged solution. While larger resolutions get the overall colony growth more or less correct, larger errors in the extent of cross-feeding arise. And in fact, with grid resolutions of greater than about 30 &#x003bc;m, oscillatory patterns arise in the solution, suggesting numerical instability. While we acknowledge that the actual solution depends on the relative rates of diffusion, reaction and regulation, we nevertheless suggest future studies use a grid spacing of &#x0223c;10 &#x003bc;m when making quantitative predictions about metabolic cross-feeding.</p><p>Second, metabolic cross-feeding can depend on strain specific characteristics, even for nearly (genetically) identical organisms. As we found for five <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, the onset time of metabolic cross-feeding and the partitioning of the colony between metabolic phenotypes depend non-linearly on features such as growth, uptake and efflux rates for shared metabolites. These subtle differences could give rise to drastically different behavior when growing in consortia of competing organisms. Hypothetically, if another organism were to compete for acetate, <italic>E. coli</italic> strains W3110 and BL21 might not fractionate into different phenotypes, while the Crooks and W strains might. This behavior will likely be highly dependent on the actual scenario simulated; as a recent study of microbiome associations showed, the extent of cooperation versus competition is highly dependent on the concentration of available nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This conjecture could be easily verified via further 3DdFBA simulations.</p><p>Third, by examining various idealised geometries we were able to identify which features significantly impacted cross-feeding. Colonies growing on &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; geometries near walls, edges, holes and plateaus resulted in significant differences compared to growth on flat surfaces. Partitioning of the population between phenotypes could be significantly affected by geometry (<italic>e.g</italic>. plateau and hole). Additionally, such geometries could introduce transient deviations from &#x0201c;steady-state&#x0201d; growth which could last for more than 20 hours (depending on the particular geometry). These results are in contrast to those seen for &#x0201c;soft&#x0201d; geometries (convex or concave surfaces), which showed minor deviations of maximally 5% in growth. Overall, our results suggest that when simulating microbial communities, it may suffice to only capture abrupt geometric features (<italic>i.e</italic>. walls, turns, confinement, <italic>etc</italic>.) while neglecting minor features (<italic>i.e</italic>. rough surfaces, mild curvature, <italic>etc</italic>.).</p><p>We believe that even this relatively simple study demonstrates the utility of 3DdFBA; such multi-scale methods supplement experimental techniques that are limited in temporal and/or spatial resolution. The simplicity and speed of 3DdFBA (nearly real-time on a modern, inexpensive GPU [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) means it could become a computational instrument in experimental and theoretical laboratories alike. That being said, there are a number of algorithmic improvements that need to be implemented; such as multi-GPU spatial decompositions (for example [<xref rid="pone.0182570.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]), and the addition of an advection equation to the algorithm, such as has been proposed by Chen <italic>et al</italic>.
