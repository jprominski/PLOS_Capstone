FcRn achieves this by binding IgG in a pH-dependent manner in acidic endosomes and recycling it to the plasma membrane to be released at neutral pH. This is important in maintaining high serum IgG and albumin levels and has the potential to be exploited to modulate the pharmacokinetics of antibody-based therapeutics. Although FcRn is responsible for the recycling of IgG, the dynamic behaviour of endogenous FcRn is not well understood. Our data shows that the majority of endogenous receptor is distributed throughout the endosomal system and is present only at a low percentage on the plasma membrane at steady state. A significant fraction of FcRn at the cell surface appears to be endocytosis resistant while the remainder can undergo rapid endocytosis. To maintain surface levels of the receptor, endocytosed FcRn is replaced with FcRn from the internal pool. This unexpected complexity in FcRn cell surface dynamics has led us to propose a model for FcRn trafficking that should be taken into account when targeting FcRn at the cell surface for therapeutic purposes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a UCB Pharma funded studentship to Lena D&#x02019;Hooghe.

FcRn expression is not however restricted to prenatal and young mammals. It is expressed widely in endothelial and epithelial cells and in tissues including liver, kidney and muscle of human adults [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In adults, FcRn has a number of proposed functions such as antibody-mediated antigen presentation in dendritic cells [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and facilitating transcytosis of IgG across epithelial barriers, both from basolateral to apical surfaces and <italic>vice versa</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, one of the main functions of FcRn in adults is in maintaining serum IgG and albumin levels. Mice with FcRn &#x02018;knocked out&#x02019; have markedly reduced serum IgG levels and IgG half-life compared to wild type controls [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In humans, siblings with familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], a condition characterised by reduced serum IgG and albumin levels with shorter half-life, were discovered to have an FcRn deficiency due to mutation in the &#x003b2;2-microglobulin gene [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a subunit of FcRn.</p><p>FcRn maintains high serum IgG levels by rescuing intracellular IgG, taken up by fluid-phase endocytosis, from degradation in lysosomes [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It facilitates this rescue due to its pH-dependent association with IgG [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182695.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], that allows binding of IgG in the acidic environment of endosomes and release at the near neutral pH at the cell surface [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This salvage of IgG requires that FcRn with bound IgG is transported from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. A number of elegant studies utilising live imaging of endothelial cells transfected with FcRn tagged with a fluorescent protein such as GFP have characterised the site of IgG salvage to be sorting endosomes [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It seems that IgG bound to FcRn is sorted into tubules originating from sorting endosomes leading to its return to the plasma membrane, while IgG unable to bind FcRn is not sorted into tubules and eventually gets degraded in lysosomes [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. FcRn protects albumin from catabolism in a similar pH dependent manner to IgG [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], however the albumin and IgG binding sites on FcRn are distinct [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The IgG/albumin salvage function of FcRn has been exploited to extend the serum half-life of biologics by fusing Fc or albumin to the active agent. Conversely when a reduction of half-life of endogenous IgG is desirable, such as in the removal of pathogenic autoreactive antibodies, blockade of FcRn (by IVIG) can be performed [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182695.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which essentially blocks the IgG salvage function of FcRn. This blockade approach however is non-specific leading to global depletion IgG and not just the desired species. The aforementioned strategies primarily depend on the binding of FcRn to IgG at acidic pH for their mechanisms of action although AbDegs, engineered to bind FcRn with high affinity at both neutral and acidic pH may have increased efficacy to IVIG [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Binding to FcRn at neutral pH also has additional potential therapeutic value. For example &#x02018;sweeping&#x02019; antibodies are engineered to bind to FcRn via their Fc domain at neutral as well as acidic pH. Furthermore, their antigen binding site is made pH-dependent so that antigen is bound at neutral pH but released at acidic pH [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, sweeping antibodies are proposed to function in the following way. They bind to FcRn and antigen at neutral pH at the cell surface. They get internalised by endocytosis (FcRn- receptor mediated) and release antigen in the acidic environment of endosomes. They get recycled back to the cell surface without antigen but still in complex with FcRn. Once returned to the cell surface they can bind more antigen. The sweeping antibody approach might be useful in depleting soluble antigens such as pro-inflammatory mediators of autoimmune reactions. They have enhanced efficacy in antigen removal over conventional antibodies and pH-dependent antibodies, having the potential to reduce frequency and concentration of dosage [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>While data from many studies is consistent with pinocytosed IgG being recycled back to the plasma membrane by FcRn, it has not been demonstrated that the FcRn itself is continuously endocytosed from and recycled back to the plasma membrane as is the case for transferrin receptor (TfR) [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In order to assess the potential of antibodies, particularly sweeping antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] that gain enhanced function through trafficking of FcRn, it is necessary to begin to understand something about the kinetics of FcRn internalisation and return to the cell surface.</p><p>In this study cell surface biotinylation assays and fluorescence microscopy have been used to investigate the distribution of endogenous FcRn and quantify the proportion that is at the surface of HepG2 cells. The dynamics of removal of FcRn from, and return to, the cell surface have also been investigated, revealing some unexpected behaviour. We present a model for endogenous FcRn trafficking that should be taken into consideration when targeting surface FcRn for therapeutic purposes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>HepG2 cell culture</title><p>HepG2 cells (European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cutures) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (85011430-1VL).

However, an alternative interpretation is that by 5 minutes, trafficking has reached an equilibrium where the amount of biotinylated FcRn returning to the plasma membrane balances the amount being endocytosed with 50% of the biotinylated FcRn being at the cell surface at any given time point. In order to test which is the most likely scenario an endocytosis/ recycling assay was performed. In this assay, the return of previously internalised biotinylated FcRn to the cell surface is monitored by introducing a second surface strip at subsequent time points following an additional incubation of cells at 37&#x000b0;C. No loss of biotinylated FcRn was observed upon stripping a second time, independently of the time point tested up to one hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182695.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>).

It should be noted that quantifying co-localisation is not straightforward [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], although we have taken an unbiased approach by presenting Pearson coefficients and Manders coefficients (with the same threshold values for all images) calculated using the ImageJ Plugin JaCoP [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] from multiple images. Furthermore, the markers used should not be considered as markers of unique compartments [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] with their steady-state distributions almost certainly overlapping in cells. Despite these caveats the cellular distribution of endogenous FcRn in HepG2 cells is consistent with previous reports investigating the distribution of recombinant tagged-FcRn in endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The proportion of surface FcRn in HepG2 cells is approximately 4%-7% of the total cellular FcRn. This is very low when compared to TfR in HepG2 cells, which has 33% at the cell surface [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However this FcRn distribution is similar to estimates from other cell types such as jejunal epithelial cells of neonatal rat [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] indicating that mechanisms controlling this distribution may be common to different cell types and that HepG2 cells are unremarkable. Cell type specific differences in distribution of FcRn cannot however be ruled out and multiple cell types of different origins that express endogenous FcRn should be tested before generalisations can be made.</p><p>Endocytosis of surface FcRn is rapid with around 50% of surface biotinylated FcRn protected from stripping with a membrane impermeant reducing reagent after 5 minutes and does not increase even after 1 hour of endocytosis. This unexpected result supports the presence of an endocytosis resistant pool of FcRn at the plasma membrane of HepG2 cells. If newly endocytosed biotinylated FcRn were recycled directly back to the plasma membrane establishing an equilibrium between endocytosis and exocytosis of biotinylated FcRn this would have been detected in the recycling assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182695.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Using this assay we have readily detected rapid recycling of claudin-1 and transferrin receptor in epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182695.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Almost identical kinetics of endocytosis of Fab fragments bound to a chimeric FcRn (cytoplasmic domain)/Fc&#x003b3;RII (extracellular and transmembrane domain) expressed in MDCK cells have been observed previously, intriguingly with only 50% of surface bound Fab being endocytosed [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Together with our data this suggests that there may be some sequence motif in the FcRn cytoplasmic domain responsible for maintaining a balance between endocytosis resistance and competence. The mechanism of retention of the endocytosis resistant surface pool of FcRn remains to be determined but the presence of endocytic resistant pools of receptors at the plasma membrane is not without precedent. Dopamine transporters in the plasma membrane of a human neuroblastoma cell line have been shown to be present endocytosis resistant and endocytosis &#x02018;willing&#x02019; populations [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore receptor tyrosine kinases present in actin based plasma membrane protrusions or caveolae are endocytosis resistant [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is possible that a pool of FcRn in the plasma membrane of HepG2 cells is immobilised and rendered endocytosis incompetent by cytoskeletal attachment or association with membrane subdomains such as lipid rafts although this will require further investigation. A physiological function of endocytosis resistant FcRn is difficult to speculate on as it doesn&#x02019;t bind to its known ligands IgG or albumin at neutral pH. However, if endocytosis resistant pools of FcRn are present <italic>in vivo</italic> this is likely to influence the effectiveness of engineered antibodies such as sweeping antibodies that bind to FcRn at neutral pH at the cell surface.</p><p>The pool of rapidly endocytosed biotinylated FcRn is replaced by FcRn from an internal pool or <italic>de novo</italic> synthesised that has not been previously biotinylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182695.g005">Fig 5</xref>). With each round of biotinylation more FcRn was labelled with no evidence of plateauing. We propose that given time the entire intracellular pool would eventually have access to the plasma membrane although it was not technically practical to carry out more than 4 rounds of biotinylation. For this reason we cannot rule out the possibility that there is an intracellular pool of FcRn that does not have access to the plasma membrane and is present in a &#x02018;storage compartment&#x02019;. This &#x02018;stored&#x02019; FcRn could be mobilised to the plasma membrane in response to a stimulus such as the presence of high levels of IgG, although we (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182695.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and others [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182695.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] have not detected changes in FcRn subcellular distribution in the presence or absence of IgG. Thus, if there is some signal leading to the mobilisation of intracellular FcRn to the cell surface, or between intracellular compartments, it is yet to be elucidated. FcRn associated with antibodies bound to multivalent antigens do however get sorted to lysosomes demonstrating that trafficking of FcRn can be influenced by extracytoplasmic molecular interactions, possibly due to physical exclusion of large complexes from &#x02018;recycling&#x02019; tubules [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182695.g006">Fig 6</xref>), in which there is continuous exchange between a mobile pool of FcRn on the cell surface (50% is endocytosis resistant) and intracellular FcRn. Consequently each individual FcRn will, on average, reside at least twentyfold longer in an intracellular compartment than at the cell surface due to the intacellular pool being more than twentyfold that of the mobile surface pool. This differs from the classical recycling behaviour of TfR and LDL receptor that rapidly return to the plasma membrane following endocytosis [<xref rid="pone.0182695.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the recycling assay employed does not reveal any return of endocytosed receptor back to the cell surface does not necessarily mean that FcRn does not recycle. With surface derived FcRn being &#x02018;diluted&#x02019; by mixing with the large internal pool of FcRn any return of biotinylated FcRn to the cell surface is likely to be below the detection threshold of the methodology that readily detects recycling of TfR. We favour a model in which, on average, each mobile FcRn can cycle multiple times between the plasma membrane and the internal pool, albeit infrequently. This is supported by the observation that surface biotinylated FcRn does not get detectably degraded upon incubation of cells at 37&#x000b0;C. The &#x02018;infrequent&#x02019; return of endocytosed FcRn to the cell surface also has implications for sweeping antibodies that bind to FcRn at the cell surface. These will presumably be recycled with the same kinetics as the unbound receptor. The model we present should be further scrutinised experimentally and tested to determine whether it is generally applicable to other cell types.</p><fig id="pone.0182695.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182695.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>A model for the endocytic trafficking of FcRn.</title><p>(1) Approximately 4% of cellular FcRn is present on the plasma membrane and accessible to biotinylation reagent.
