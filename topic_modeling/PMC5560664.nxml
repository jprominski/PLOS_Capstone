The association of a fraction of various serum proteins such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) with circulating exosomes has been debated. The establishment of a method to measure the exosomal fraction of such proteins might help resolve this controversy. The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to measure serum exosomal molecules, for example CEA, is rare in research laboratories and totally absent in clinical biology. In this study, we optimized a method for assessment of serum exosomal molecules combining a treatment by volume-excluding polymers to isolate the exosomes, their subsequent solubilization in an assay buffer and ELISA.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred sixteen consecutive patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled for this study between June 2015 and June 2016 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital (WMUH). Whole blood samples were collected from patients during surgery. Exosomes were isolated using the ExoQuick reagent, solubilized in an assay buffer and subjected to CEA detection by ELISA. The procedure of serum exosome isolation and the formulation of the assay buffer used for the ELISA were optimized in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>A five-fold increase in the concentration of the exosomes in the assay buffer (using initial serum volume as a reference) and the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) resulted in more accurate measurements of the serum exosomal CEA. The thawing temperature of frozen serum samples before exosome extraction was also optimized. A validation study that included one hundred sixteen patients with colorectal cancer demonstrated that serum exosomal CEA from samples thawed at 25&#x000b0;C exhibited a better AUC value, sensitivity, and specificity as well as a more correct classification than serum CEA.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We optimized an easy and rapid detection method for assessment of serum exosomal CEA. The thawing temperature of frozen serum prior to exosome extraction, the formulation of the assay buffer used for exosome solubilization and the concentration of the exosomes in this buffer were fine-tuned to enable the appropriate and accurate measurement of serum exosomal CEA.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>26461958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1301-6434</contrib-id><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Shozo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Grant-in-Aid 26461958 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan.

Various cell types are able to generate and release exosomes [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and exosomes reflect the characteristics of their parent cells [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, an exosome can transfer various signals via proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA, and microRNA [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, it has been speculated that the accurate measurement of serum exosomal markers may provide a great deal of information regarding diseases such as cancer [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183337.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183337.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and/or metabolic and cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to measure serum exosomal molecules is neither common nor clinically available. To address these issues, we investigated the feasibility of measuring serum molecules by ELISA and volume-excluding polymers for exosome isolation. The goal is to provide a simple and rapid method for performing such measurements for both clinical and research applications.</p><p>Exosomal miR-19a [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and exosomal CD9 and CD147 [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] are diagnostic and predictive markers for colorectal cancer, whereas exosomal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has not yet been investigated in this context. Because serum CEA is used clinically as a marker worldwide, we selected CEA as a target molecule in this study, although it has certain limitations. CEA is used to monitor the recurrence of colorectal cancer but not for early detection [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Serum CEA is also associated with high false-positive rates [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], leading to unnecessary examinations following curative surgical resection of colorectal cancer. Serum CEA includes secreted and cleaved CEA as well as exosomal CEA. Normal colonic mucosa secretes CEA [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. If cancer cells release more exosomes [<xref rid="pone.0183337.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] than normal cells, the measurement of serum exosomal CEA may enable the discrimination between normal and morbid conditions. Moreover, clinicians and surgeons need a tumor marker that can be used to discriminate between the presence and absence of distant metastasis before and after curative resection.</p><p>In the present study, we optimized a method to measure serum exosomal CEA by utilizing volume-excluding polymers and ELISA, and we examined whether serum exosomal CEA can better predict the existence of distant metastasis than serum CEA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>We enrolled 116 consecutive patients treated for colorectal cancer between June 2015 and June 2016 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital and 8 normal healthy subjects.

Based on the TNM classification system, 39, 22, 36, and 19 patients had colorectal carcinoma of stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. All patients underwent surgery, during which whole blood samples were collected. The current study was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of Wakayama Medical University Hospital.

Frozen serum samples from normal healthy subject were thawed at 4, 25, or 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. After exosome isolation by using ExoQuick Exosome Precipitation Solution, protein extraction was performed with RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Paso Robles, CA, USA). The samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In each lane, 10 &#x003bc;l of each sample was loaded and separated in a precast polyacrylamide gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Proteins were then electrotransferred onto PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After blocking the membrane with 5% electrophoresis-grade nonfat milk, primary and secondary antibodies were incubated for 60 min each in a 5% milk solution. Immune complexes were visualized by incubating the membranes with an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody using the ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). The primary antibody was mouse monoclonal CD63 antibody (Ts63, diluted at 1:250, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The secondary antibody was sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP (diluted 1:1000, GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Optimization of pre-analytical conditions</title><p>To optimize measurement of serum exosomal CEA, the effects of concentration of the samples, formulation of the solvent, and thawing temperatures for frozen samples were evaluated.

When Milli-Q water was used as a solvent for the exosome sample serum exosomal CEA could not be detected by ELISA, whereas when 1% BSA was used it was able to be measured. The use of 1% BSA as a solvent is therefore required for the detection of serum exosomal CEA. Notably, 1% BSA, which is typically used as a blocking buffer for ELISA, may alter the antigen&#x02014;antibody reaction or interactions among exosomes. Further investigations are required to address how 1% BSA contributes to the detection of CEA.</p><p>CEA is a glycoprotein and is generally hydrated. The thawing temperature for frozen samples may change the hydration of CEA, which affects antibody responses against the antigen. Therefore, different thawing temperatures were examined. Exosome quantities did not differ among thawing temperatures, but exosomal CEA values measured using ELISA differed among thawing temperatures. Therefore, thawing temperature may affect the antigenicity of CEA by affecting the dehydration status. Additional molecular research is required to address this variation.</p><p>It is important for clinicians and surgeons to discriminate between local and systemic disease status of patients with colorectal cancer, because each calls for different therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The accurate diagnosis of distant metastasis in colorectal cancer can let clinicians and surgeons devise a proper treatment plan. Moreover, the accurate diagnosis of distant metastasis also benefits patients without recurrence of colorectal cancer, because a false-positive test result leads to improper examinations. The present study demonstrated that measurements of serum exosomal CEA could increase the rate of correct diagnosis and could allow discrimination between the presence and absence of distant metastasis. Serum exosomal CEA is a promising tumor marker for diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer.</p><p>This method may be applicable for other proteins and glycoproteins. However, this study had certain limitations. The selected concentration, solvent, and temperature are not common across all exosomal proteins and glycoproteins and must be adjusted to the selected exosomal glycoprotein. Moreover, because our data are derived with respect to a specific exosome isolation reagent and ELISA kit, each parameter should be adjusted for the selected reagent and kit. We used a ready-made ExoQuick reagent and a CEA (human) ELISA kit. Neither the reagent nor the antibodies were prepared for the detection of exosomal markers. Exosome isolation reagents should be developed for specific exosomal markers. The measurement range for the CEA (human) ELISA kit used in this study was 0 to 120 ng/ml, which is unsuitable for detecting exosomal CEA, because the cut-off value for exosomal CEA was approximately 2 ng/ml in the current study. Appropriate exosome isolation reagents and ELISA kits specific for exosomal markers need to be improved and established for appropriate applications involving exosomal proteins and glycoproteins.</p><p>In conclusion, we optimized a simple and rapid detection method for exosomal glycoproteins such as CEA. The concentration of the exosome sample, the formulation of the solvent for the exosomes, and the thawing temperature of frozen serum before extraction were fine-tuned to enable the appropriate and accurate measurement of exosomal CEA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Writing assistance</bold>: Dr. Neil M.
