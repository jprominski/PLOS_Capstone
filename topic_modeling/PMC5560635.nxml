In this study, the effects of exoskeletal constraints on metabolic energy expenditure were evaluated in able-bodied volunteers to gain insight into the demands of walking with a hybrid neuroprosthesis after paralysis. The exoskeleton had a hydraulic mechanism to reciprocally couple hip flexion and extension, unlocked hydraulic stance controlled knee mechanisms, and ankles fixed at neutral by ankle-foot orthoses. These mechanisms added passive resistance to the hip (15 Nm) and knee (6 Nm) joints while the exoskeleton constrained joint motion to the sagittal plane. The average oxygen consumption when walking with the exoskeleton was 22.5 &#x000b1; 3.4 ml O<sub>2</sub>/min/kg as compared to 11.7 &#x000b1; 2.0 ml O<sub>2</sub>/min/kg when walking without the exoskeleton at a comparable speed. The heart rate and physiological cost index with the exoskeleton were at least 30% and 4.3 times higher, respectively, than walking without it. The maximum average speed achieved with the exoskeleton was 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.2 m/s, at a cadence of 104 &#x000b1; 11 steps/min, and step length of 70 &#x000b1; 7 cm. Average peak hip joint angles (25 &#x000b1; 7&#x000b0;) were within normal range, while average peak knee joint angles (40 &#x000b1; 8&#x000b0;) were less than normal. Both hip and knee angular velocities were reduced with the exoskeleton as compared to normal. While the walking speed achieved with the exoskeleton could be sufficient for community ambulation, metabolic energy expenditure was significantly increased and unsustainable for such activities. This suggests that passive resistance, constraining leg motion to the sagittal plane, reciprocally coupling the hip joints, and weight of exoskeleton place considerable limitations on the utility of the device and need to be minimized in future designs of practical hybrid neuroprostheses for walking after paraplegia.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006380</institution-id><institution>Rehabilitation Research and Development Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B0608-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kobetic</surname><given-names>Rudi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AR007505-29</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VA Center of Advanced Platform Technology</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Rehabilitation Research and Development Service of Veterans Affairs (merit review award B0608-R to RK), and the Department of Veterans Affairs Center of Advanced Platform Technology.

Passive lower limb bracing can enable stepping by locking joints to support the user while the upper extremities balance and advance the body [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Powered exoskeletons have motors capable of supporting and moving lower extremity joints through the trajectories needed to complete steps [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In general, commercially-available powered exoskeletons (12&#x02013;23 kg) have electric motors at hip and knee joints to move the lower limbs through a preset walking pattern. The HNP is a muscle-first approach that combines the primary power derived from FNS and the stability of passive lower limb controllable bracing (exoskeleton) [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Neural stimulation generates the necessary joint moments required for walking in paraplegia, while the exoskeleton provides the ability to support and stabilize the user by locking, unlocking, coordinating joints, and constraining degrees of freedom to the sagittal plane. Exoskeletons can be instrumented with sensors for feedback control to coordinate neural stimulation with context-dependent joint constraints. Most systems for walking in individuals with paraplegia require some upper body effort to maintain balance by means of walking aids. In addition, because muscle stimulation response differs among individuals and muscles fatigue rapidly at high duty cycle of stimulation required for walking, power assistance by external motors has recently been proposed and implemented to improve walking in hybrid systems [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Each of these technologies requires users to expend a certain amount of metabolic energy to walk that is typically more than required during able-bodied walking. Metabolic energy can be measured in the volume of oxygen consumed (ml of O<sub>2</sub>/min/kg). In addition, the physiological cost index (PCI) measured in heart beats per meter is often used to report energy cost of walking [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While this method is not reliable for comparison across subjects, it is reliable for comparing energy cost within a subject under different conditions [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Able-bodied individuals walking at an average normal speed of 1.3 m/s use about 3.4 times the average amount of oxygen consumed at rest [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], expressed as a &#x0201c;metabolic equivalent&#x0201d; where one MET is approximately 3.5 ml O<sub>2</sub>/min/kg. An individual with paraplegia uses 8 METs when walking at 0.5 m/s with FNS-alone [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and 4.4 METs when walking with an RGO at approximately 0.2 m/s [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In comparison, individuals with paraplegia walking in powered exoskeletons had metabolic demands averaging 3.3 METs at an average speed of 0.27 m/s [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Only a limited number of muscles can be activated via stimulation for walking after paraplegia, resulting in generation of joint moments less than able-bodied values but adequate to restore stepping motions before onset of muscle fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, users of FNS-only systems rely substantially on the upper extremities for support and balance. As a result, the metabolic energy consumed when walking with stimulation alone or combined with an exoskeleton in a hybrid neuroprosthesis is considerably higher than for normal walking at comparable speeds. In order to isolate the effects of the exoskeleton and separate them from the metabolic costs of stimulation, only able-bodied subjects were evaluated in this study. Unimpaired walking by abled-bodied individuals provides the optimal neuromuscular system for stepping in the exoskeleton, since normal muscle activation is available. An exoskeleton that increases effort and limits walking speed in able-bodied individuals is also likely to hinder walking in individuals with paraplegia whose muscles may be deconditioned and easily fatigued with stimulation. Therefore, we hypothesized that able-bodied individuals walking with the joint constraints of an exoskeleton could attain speeds relevant for community ambulation at sustainable levels of metabolic energy expenditure. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the passive exoskeletal component of the HNP system during able-bodied walking, as measured by metabolic energy consumption, physiological cost index, walking speed, cadence, and step length.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Six able-bodied individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183125.t001">Table 1</xref>) volunteered and signed the written informed consent forms to participate in this study approved by the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center Institutional Review Board.

The average PCI when walking with and without the exoskeleton was calculated by subtracting the average resting heart rate from the average walking heart rate and dividing by walking speed [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Responses to stimulation differ with fatigue and between individuals resulting in varying joint torques and joint angular velocities during stepping.</p><p>In this study, the able-bodied participants walked with the knees unlocked in order to eliminate the need for a control system to coordinate joint locking with each step. Locking the knee joints during stance phase could be beneficial for individuals with paraplegia to provide added stability and additional time during gait when the knee extensor muscles could rest to potentially delay the onset of muscle fatigue by reducing duty cycle of muscle activation [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The exoskeletal component of the HNP, rather than a commercially-available exoskeleton, was selected for this study because its design is compatible with implanted neuroprostheses that individuals with paraplegia would use for stepping [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

This study indicates a need to focus on designing an exoskeleton that reduces the effects of device weight and joints&#x02019; passive resistance in order to minimize user effort, unlike the available commercial devices where motive power is derived from motors and the user effort is required only to maintain balance. Future designs of a muscle-first approach should consider external motor power for assistance on an as-needed basis to compensate for weakened muscles and when muscles fatigue with stimulation in order to maintain walking. The passive resistance of exoskeletal joints should be minimized, and actuators used to move the joints should be backdrivable to maximize stimulated walking and physiological benefits of a muscle-first approach.</p><p>As commercial technology continues to advance toward incorporating FNS in coordination with the exoskeleton capabilities, there will be a convergence of technologies that will result in their optimal combination into a hybridized system to restore stepping in individuals with paraplegia. The effects of joint constraints, passive resistance and device weight will need to be addressed to achieve this goal. While existing commercially-available powered exoskeletons can successfully restore stepping in individuals with paraplegia, these devices also limit the degrees of freedom to the sagittal plane, have inherent passive resistance in the electric motors, do not provide actuation at the ankle joint, and add weight to each segment of the lower limb, all these factors need to be considered in future system designs that are to be integrated with FNS technology or residual voluntary function.</p><p>This study indicates that, even though able-bodied individuals were able to attain community ambulation speeds in the exoskeleton, the metabolic energy expenditure was significantly elevated to levels not sustainable for prolonged walking. This suggests that there are limitations in the system that should be addressed in future designs of devices to restore stepping in individuals with paraplegia. In particular, reducing the passive resistance, having the ability to modulate the reciprocally coupled hips, and unlocking the ankle joint could improve the system. The passive resistance of the hydraulics increased the amount of friction that users had to overcome in order to take each step. Needing to overcome this resistance likely increased the amount of energy that had to be expended. Ideally, the amount of passive resistance should be minimized in any system used to restore gait. By modulating the hip joints between reciprocally coupled and independently freed, the PCI could potentially be lowered by means of increasing step length and speed. However, it is important to balance variable hip coupling with freed hips to ensure that the users have optimal truncal support to reduce forward trunk tilt during walking and reduce the need for upper body support [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Activating the paralyzed plantar flexor muscles with neural stimulation could provide the active push-off required to increase gait speed and step length, thus reducing energy cost [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Responses to stimulation can differ between each individual with SCI, resulting in different capabilities for restored stepping [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Muscle fatigue and joint range of motion limitations (e.g., contractures) typical after paralysis may also affect system performance. However, physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises can be designed and implemented for each individual with SCI using stimulation to increase endurance and effectiveness of stimulation for restored stepping [<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183125.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, constraining hip movements to the sagittal plane with the exoskeleton likely had an effect on speed and efficiency of walking. The weight of the exoskeleton that needs to be overcome during each step should also be minimized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec005"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183125.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Data used in all analyses.</title><p>Walking speed, cadence, step length; average METs, heart rate, oxygen consumption, and PCI.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183125.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by the Rehabilitation Research and Development Service of Veterans Affairs (Merit Review Award B0608-R to RK), and the Department of Veterans Affairs Center of Advanced Platform Technology.
