Demo-genetic modelling allows inferring the way past demographic and migration dynamics have determined this structure. <italic>Amborella trichopoda</italic> is an emblematic relict plant endemic to New Caledonia, widely distributed in the understory of non-ultramafic rainforests. We assessed the influence of the last glacial climates on the demographic history and the paleo-distribution of 12 <italic>Amborella</italic> populations covering the whole current distribution. We performed coalescent genetic modelling of these dynamics, based on both whole-genome resequencing and microsatellite genotyping data. We found that the two main genetic groups of <italic>Amborella</italic> were shaped by the divergence of two ancestral populations during the last glacial maximum. From 12,800 years BP, the South ancestral population has expanded 6.3-fold while the size of the North population has remained stable. Recent asymmetric gene flow between the groups further contributed to the phylogeographical pattern. Spatially explicit coalescent modelling allowed us to estimate the location of ancestral populations with good accuracy (&#x0003c; 22 km) and provided indications regarding the mid-elevation pathways that facilitated post-glacial expansion.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004562</institution-id><institution>Minist&#x000e8;re de l'Education Nationale, de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tournebize</surname><given-names>R&#x000e9;mi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>RT is supported by a PhD grant from the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Climatic fluctuations have prevailed throughout the Quaternary period, influencing species distribution and population dynamics through an alternation of expansion, contraction and fragmentation phases [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183412.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These dynamics have shaped the current distribution and structuring of intra-specific genetic diversity [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Specifically, isolation of small populations within refugial habitats during past glacial periods could increase genetic drift and favour population divergence [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], both influencing the present-day pattern of genetic diversity.

New Caledonia is an archipelago located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183412.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and a biodiversity hotspot where more than 74% of the 3,099 inventoried angiosperm species are endemic [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. High environmental heterogeneity prevails in this country [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the climate&#x02014;currently tropical to sub-tropical&#x02014;has greatly fluctuated over the last 30,000 years [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183412.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Furthermore, <italic>Amborella</italic> is the most basal clade of angiosperms, and previous studies have investigated its genome and genetic diversity in order to understand the evolution of flowering plants [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Moreover, the present geographical distribution of <italic>Amborella</italic> in New Caledonia suggests that climate change had an impact during the LGM (ca. 22,000 years BP) and Holocene (ca. 12,000 years BP), when <italic>Amborella</italic> experienced a dramatic reduction in suitable habitat.

We thus compared twelve demographic scenarios&#x02014;assuming either a single or two past ancestral population(s) present during the potential contraction phase, out of which the two currently major genetic groups could be derived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183412.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). In addition to the number and size of putative ancestral populations, the twelve demographic scenarios also considered different divergence time between the two major genetic groups. We also considered variations in expansion dynamics: (a) abrupt or smooth population growth, and (b) presence or absence of gene flow among populations before and/or during the expansion phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183412.s005">S3 Table</xref>).

Moreover, to account for the possible impact of current unsampled populations onto the demographic inference, a supplementary structured model was designed, including three additional unsampled populations to the two previously sampled ones. In this model, the five current populations diverged at the same time and the sampled populations were allowed to exchange symmetric gene flow with the unsampled ones after the expansion onset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183412.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Localizing ancestral populations and characterizing expansion dynamics</title><p>To infer the geographical extent of the ancestral populations and their recent expansion, we carried out spatially explicit, coalescent demo-genetic modelling using the microsatellite marker dataset.

Major climate disturbance associated with the Pleistocene-Holocene transition could have fostered the genetic differentiation of <italic>Amborella</italic> by driving the fragmentation of its distribution into two separate ancestral populations from 23,400 to 12,800 years BP.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Geographical locations of the ancestral populations</title><p>Spatially explicit modelling using microsatellite markers allows pinpointing the geographical extent of population expansion origins, accounting for landscape heterogeneity and the effect of unsampled local populations. Our spatial model displayed two separate geographical origins between ~23,400 and ~12,800 years BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183412.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Post-hoc tests suggested that the estimated locations were not biased by the a priori number of ancestral populations implemented in the spatial model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183412.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>).</p><p>Their locations were predicted in suitable habitats under the MIROC SDM, while the area between the two geographic regions was predicted to have been unsuitable at the mid-Holocene. The two ancestral populations then stood on both sides of the Houa&#x000ef;lou River valley, likely an unsuitable area for <italic>Amborella</italic> about 12,800 years BP. Unsuitable microclimatic conditions in this area during the LGM and the glacial-interglacial transition could have created and maintained an ecological barrier disrupting gene flow between the Northern and Southern groups and promoting their divergence. Owing to the time estimate uncertainty for the expansion onset (6,500&#x02013;39,040 years BP), the distribution of the ancestral population locations could be also compatible with the pattern of suitable habitat at mid-Holocene (~6,000 years BP).</p><p>The Northern ancestral population origin was included within an area that was already identified as a refugium for sixty relict angiosperm taxa predominantly restricted to non-ultramafic rainforests under the LGM [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Based on CCSM paleo-projections of their species distribution models, Pouteau <italic>et al</italic>. (2015) found maximum species richness under LGM in the Aoupini&#x000e9; Mount area, which is in line with our predicted location of maximum presence probability for the Northern ancestral population of <italic>Amborella</italic>. Although the Massif des L&#x000e8;vres has been suggested as a putative refugium in a preliminary study [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], our modelling allowed to pinpoint more accurately the most likely origin within the probability envelopes.</p><p>Moreover, our spatial demo-genetic modelling suggested a new expansion origin for the Southern population of <italic>Amborella</italic>. Previous studies based on species distribution modelling did not identify this area as a possible refugium for rainforest plant species [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183412.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Distribution modelling may be impaired in New Caledonia by lack of accuracy and spatial uncertainty in general circulation models [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This southern area, however, overlaps a major centre of present relict angiosperm diversity [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183412.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and could have preserved angiosperm diversity under recent environmental fluctuations. In this regard, our results suggest that demo-genetic modelling can complement species distribution modelling or descriptive phylogeographic analyses, to get insights into the location and dynamics of past refugia.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Dynamics of post-glacial population range expansion</title><p>The shape and speed of range expansion were likely influenced by environmental heterogeneity along with more intrinsic properties of species migration and growth rates [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Spatially explicit modelling suggested that the topography could have influenced gene flow among adjacent populations, limiting dispersion at low elevation since ~12,800 years BP. Our posterior estimates on friction coefficients suggest that <italic>Amborella</italic> was less likely to cross low elevations (valleys) than higher ones (mountain ridges). In addition, non-spatial modelling revealed that gene flow was 3-fold higher from Northern to Southern populations than inversely. The Northern population has had a greater and steadier size over the last 23,400 years, suggesting it could thus have been a source population for Southern populations during the expansion phase. The spatial model suggested that present genetic diversity was shaped by at least two waves of expansion stemming from at least two different genetic pools, one located in the neighbourhood of the Aoupini&#x000e9;, the other from the neighborhood of the Dogny plateau in the Southern part of <italic>Amborella</italic> distribution. Based on the spatial coalescent analysis, the Ba population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183412.g001">Fig 1</xref>) was first colonized by the Northern wave before being soon reached by the Southern one. This secondary contact zone between Northern and Southern expansion waves probably drove the admixture observed in Ba population along with high heterozygosity and low private allele counts. The Aoupini&#x000e9; could thus have been source population for the expansion with later admixture from the Southern wave.</p><p>Local population densities reached habitat carrying capacities in a few generations during the expansion phase for both North and South ancestral populations. The high growth rate and Northern and Central migration rate values indicated low founder effects above 21.3&#x000b0;S latitude. The expansion rate was higher in the Southern zone: the population size increased by 530% compared to its initial population size, indicating high post-glacial demographic expansion. Yet, based on spatially explicit modelling, the carrying capacity and effective migration rate in the zone were lower than in the Central or Northern ones, suggesting stronger genetic drift in the South. These results indicated that <italic>Amborella</italic> density had likely varied in space and time over the last 12,800 years, especially in the Southern zone, where more frequent fire events about 3,000 years BP [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183412.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] could have favoured open savannah over lowland rainforests. Low migration rates and topographic heterogeneity in the South likely led to anisotropic range expansion, genetically characterized by an excess of rare alleles in peripheral populations and increased genetic differentiation among populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Insights of demo-genetic models into evolutionary ecology</title><p>Using a large set of SNPs and geo-referenced microsatellite data, and by combining two demo-genetic modelling frameworks, we inferred the demographic history, the location of ancestral populations and the subsequent expansion dynamics of <italic>Amborella trichopoda</italic> in New Caledonia. The approach allows addressing past population dynamics in a spatially-explicit way, and it overcomes some limitations of inferring distribution changes from species distribution models (SDMs) neglecting demography and spatial population dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. SDM assumptions neglect the influence of genetic variability, extinction-recolonization metapopulation dynamics and range expansions [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], but we suggest that demo-genetic modelling can overcome these limits. We also illustrated that paleo-climate layers from various general circulation models introduced uncertainty in habitat suitability projection, a known issue for insular contexts [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Demo-genetic modelling is an alternative and complementary framework to investigate species distribution change. Specifically, they acknowledge the influence of dispersal limitations, here modelled as a two-dimensional stepping-stone model with topography-dependent friction [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. They however neglect long-distance dispersal processes, which are considered rare, especially in the understory where <italic>Amborella trichopoda</italic> grows, but which could potentially have strong impact on the evolution of genetic diversity [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Overall, demo-genetic models offer promising prospects for understanding evolutionary responses of organisms to climate change, especially when they can be compared to reliable SDMs and/or paleo-chorological maps derived from fossil or isotopic records [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Comparison of independent datasets and models can provide complementary insights into the relative balance of geographical shifts <italic>versus</italic> ecological niche shifts and into the evolution of genetic diversity under climate change. We argue that since species adaptability depends on current genetic diversity and its historical drivers [<xref rid="pone.0183412.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the critical interplay between climate and genetic variations should be more thoroughly investigated to better predict biodiversity dynamics under the influence of ongoing and future climate change.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Bioinformatic data pre-processing.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Data analyses and modelling.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Genetic sampling design.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Matrix of pairwise allele sharing distances.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Typology of the non-spatial demo-genomic models.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s006"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Non spatial demo-genomic model comparison.</title><p>Maximum composite likelihoods, AICs and evidence ratios for the 13 tested demo-genomic models.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s007"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Parameter estimation for the most likely demo-genomic model (2M).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s008"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Predictive check of the adjusted 2M demo-genomic model.</title><p>Genetic summary statistics derived from the observed probabilistic SFS vs. their prediction under the adjusted 2M scenario.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s008.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s009"><label>S7 Table</label><caption><title>Mean-standardized root-mean-square error (SRMSE) of parameter estimation for the spatial coalescent model.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s010"><label>S8 Table</label><caption><title>Mean posterior estimates for key parameters of the spatially explicit demo-genetic model.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s010.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s011"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Genetic structure.</title><p>(A; C) Inference using the ADMIXTURE software; (B; D) using the sNMF software; (E) using the full-genotype likelihood software NGSAdmix.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183412.s011.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183412.s012"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Posterior parameter distributions of the spatial demo-genetic inference.</title><p>Prior densities (grey-filled) and marginal posterior densities (red-filled) for 16 parameters of the spatially explicit demo-genetic modelling.
