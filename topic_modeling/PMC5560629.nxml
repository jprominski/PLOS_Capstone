However, studies on the regulatory mechanisms that operate in this plant in response to nitrogen (N) shortage are scarce. In this study, genome-wide transcriptional profiles of the roots and leaves of 8-week old physic nut seedlings were analyzed after 2 and 16 days of N starvation. Enrichment results showed that genes associated with N metabolism, processing and regulation of RNA, and transport predominated among those showing alterations in expression. Genes encoding transporter families underwent major changes in expression in both roots and leaves; in particular, those with roles in ammonia, amino acid and peptide transport were generally up-regulated after long-term starvation, while <italic>AQUAPORIN</italic> genes, whose products function in osmoregulation, were down-regulated. We also found that <italic>ASPARA&#x02212;GINASE B1</italic> and <italic>SARCOSINE OXIDASE</italic> genes were up-regulated in roots and leaves after 2 and 16 d N starvation. Genes associated with ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation were significantly up-regulated. In addition, genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway were strongly activated while expression of those in GA signaling was inhibited in leaves. We showed that four major classes of genes, those with roles in N uptake, N reutilization, C/N ratio balance, and cell structure and synthesis, were particularly influenced by long-term N limitation. Our discoveries may offer clues to the molecular mechanisms that regulate N reallocation and reutilization so as to maintain or increase plant performance even under adverse environmental conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>ZSZC-014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8204-4928</contrib-id><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Guojiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>GJW was funded by Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ZSZC-014) HWJ was founded by the National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB126603).

N limitation affects all aspects of plant function, since N is a key component of amino acids, nucleic acids, chlorophyll, ATP, and several plant hormones [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In order to cope with a lack of N, plants have evolved regulatory systems enabling them to adapt to adverse environments. High-throughput platforms such as microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) are effective methods with which to establish massive sets of transcriptomic, which can be used to delineate integrative networks [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous analysis of transcriptome profiles in Arabidopsis showed that two days of N deprivation repressed the expression of many genes, including those associated with photosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, and plastid protein synthesis, at the same time inducing many genes for secondary metabolism and the reprogramming of mitochondrial electron transport [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Another study showed that genes involved in nitrogen assimilation, chlorophyll metabolism, photosynthesis, photorespiration, photosystem (PS), the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway, and ribosomal components were repressed, while genes participating in the accumulation of starch, protein degradation, and anthocyanin synthesis, together with peroxidase and MYB transcription factors <italic>PAP1</italic> and <italic>PAP2</italic> were significantly up-regulated in Arabidopsis shoots by three weeks of low nitrate treatment [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In reproductive stage wheat, transcriptome clustering indicated that the expression of genes encoding NiR and ferredoxin-glutamate synthase, which participate in N assimilation, a protease, fructan-related enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate carbox-ylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small subunit, two subunits of PSII and enzymes of the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis pathway was elevated, whereas transcription of genes for sucrose synthase, and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase and arabinoxylan arabino-furanohydrolase which function in cell wall modification, was reduced under low N conditions [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Meta-analysis that integrated the publicly-available transcriptome data for roots treated with different N concentrations demonstrated that the most robustly nitrate-responsive functions were those of transport, signaling, and metabolism, and that G2-like transcription factors (TFs) were hub genes controlling transport and signaling functions [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These results indicated that most genes responsive to N limitation are associated with metabolic pathways for N availability, and that the transport of N-containing components is strongly impacted by N conditions.</p><p>Recently, studies have been published concerning the behavior of different organs during periods of exposure to N limitation. After 2 d and 10 d of N starvation in a hydroponic growth system, the genes up-regulated in Arabidopsis roots were found to be clustered in the metal handling, amino acid (AA) metabolism, transport and stress categories at day 10, whereas the similar groups were overrepresented among the genes down-regulated in shoots, except that metal handling, TCA cycle, hormone metabolism, and redox system components were specifically down-regulated at day 10 [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Arabidopsis under 4 d, 7 d and 10 d of N-free treatment, genes commonly up-regulated in true leaves mainly encoded members of the NAC and MYB families of TFs, and enzymes of protein degradation and secondary metabolism, while genes down-regulated at all time points included components of photosystem, protein synthesis, AA synthesis, tetrapyrrole synthesis and nucleotide metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In rice, after 1 h, 1 d and 7 d of N starvation, more kinase-related genes were down-regulated than up-regulated in roots, whereas the opposite was true for shoots, and large numbers of TF-related genes were transiently activated after 1 h stress, in contrast to genes encoding transporters, which were activated under long-term N starvation [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is estimated that the percentage of N responsive genes in the maize transcriptome is similar to that observed in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, 88% of the Arabidopsis genes showing a response to given treatment did so in an organ-specific manner [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, although there has been much research on model plants, studies on responses to N limitation in non-model species including trees are scarce, and the integrative networks that operate in such species are still unclear.</p><p><italic>J. curcas</italic> (physic nut), a multipurpose shrub or tree with medical uses and considerable potential as biofuel, which belongs to the family <italic>Euphorbiaceae</italic>, possesses valuable characteristics, such as rapid growth, drought tolerance, and adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We have established a high-density genetic map for further dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits, based on previous studies on the <italic>J. curcas</italic> genome [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Research into the response of physic nut to salt and drought stresses has also been conducted recently [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Information about the genome and transcriptomic profiles of physic nut tissues can provide valuable resources not only for fundamental studies but also for practical application in improving the resistance of the species to stresses. However, studies on the responses of physic nut roots and leaves to N depletion have not previously been reported. The work presented here focuses on obtaining detailed insights into the impacts of N starvation on <italic>J. curcas</italic> in different organs and over medium and longer time-frames. We obtained the transcriptomic profiles of roots and leaves after 2 d and 16 d of nitrate deficiency in order to explore the effects of these treatments at a molecular level. Genes showing consistent changes in expression in response to N deficiency were identified, and the adaptive responses potentially associated with these changes are discussed. We aim to elucidate the organ-specific responses of <italic>J. curcas</italic> to medium- and long-term N starvation, and hence provide molecular tools with which to improve the efficiency of N utilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material and growth</title><p>Seedlings of physic nut cultivar GZQX0401 were grown to the six-leaf stage in pots containing sand irrigated daily with Hoagland nutrient solution [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Before stress treatments were applied, the growth medium was washed with deionized water to removing soluble ions.

These were the point at which the Pn ratio began a rapid process of attenuation to 80% after two days of treatment (mid-term N deficiency response), and the time at which ratio of Pn was maintained at 64% after a 16-day treatment (long-term N deficiency response). Root samples comprised all root tips 5-10 mm long, and leaf blades sampled were from the fourth fully expanded leaf from the apex. Samples were harvested from three seedlings for each time point, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until required for RNA extraction.

MapMan classification showed that DEGs associated with the processes of N assimilation and AA and protein metabolism were predominated under stress in both roots and leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g002">Fig 2</xref>). DEGs with roles of processing and regulation of RNA, signaling and transport were also significantly enriched. Because transporters are the crucial gateways through which nutrient elements enter plants, the functions of N transporters and the genes that encode them have been intensively studied. Meta-analysis has shown that the ion transport gene network module is robustly responsive to nitrate in Arabidopsis roots [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among the transporters, members of high-affinity NRT2 families play important roles in N uptake under low N conditions [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our profiling study, the levels of <italic>JcNRT2.1</italic> transcript in roots were up-regulated at both 2 d and 16 d of N deprivation, while both <italic>JcNRT1.1</italic> and <italic>JcNRT1.11</italic> were repressed after 16 d of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In leaves, however, the up-regulated NRT genes were <italic>JcNRT2.5</italic> and <italic>JcNRT1.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The dual-affinity Arabidopsis protein AtNRT1.1 has receptor activities which can operate over a wide range of concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Under conditions of severe N starvation, AtNRT2.5 contributes to the phloem loading of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> in Arabidopsis shoots and functions with AtNRT2.1, AtNRT2.2, and AtNRT2.4 to support shoot growth [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We inferred that the high-affinity N transporters play leading roles under N limitation in roots, while the coordinated action of JcNRT1 and JcNRT2 makes leaves more adaptable to variations in N concentration. In addition, <italic>JcAMTs</italic> were up-regulated, probably to promote the uptake of ammonia under stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Most membrane channel AQP proteins facilitate efficient transfer of water and small neutral molecules across biological membranes, and they are extremely sensitive to nitrogen deprivation in plants [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our study, the expression of <italic>JcTIP2;1</italic>, <italic>JcTIP1;3</italic>, and <italic>JcTIP2;3</italic> was reduced in roots, suggesting that in these plants internal osmotic stress was increased by a reduction in the levels of expression of <italic>AQPs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p><p>Nitrogen uptake is coupled with N assimilation and the remobilization of organic nitrogen at the whole-plant level [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Under N deprivation, <italic>JcNR</italic>, <italic>JcNIR</italic>, <italic>JcGOGAT</italic>, and genes related to the synthesis of organic acids and Asp family AAs were negatively regulated in roots, suggesting that not only N assimilation but also the production of AAs was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In Arabidopsis, organic N induces <italic>AtNR</italic> and <italic>AtASN1</italic>, but negatively regulates <italic>AtAMT1.1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, the inhibition of <italic>JcASN1</italic> expression and the up-regulation of <italic>JcAMT1.1</italic> are consistent with the reduction in N availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). In leaves, many genes associated with AA synthesis and degradation and protein degradation were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In particular, the gene <italic>ASPGB1</italic> was significantly up-regulated in both roots and leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182700.s008">S2 Table</xref>). Under long-term exposure of reproductive-stage wheat to low N, <italic>ASPG</italic> was also significantly up-regulated in stems and leaves [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Expression of genes in the ubiquitination pathway for protein degradation, including those encoding enzymes of the E2 and E3 families, was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Long-term N limitation induced the same effect in Arabidopsis. For instance, ubiquitin ligase <italic>nla</italic> mutants grown with low N failed to degrade N metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, the genes encoding Rubisco and enzymes required for the synthesis of chlorophyll precursors were dramatically repressed in our studies, indicating that N-containing reserves were being remobilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Rubisco is the main leaf N storage protein, typically representing 30-50% of the total protein [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Expression of genes in the AAT family was strongly activated in both leaves and roots (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">4A</xref>). Amino acids distributed by AATs after the N assimilation and reduction of inorganic N root or shoot tissue [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Because AAs have a wide range of structures and physical properties, most plants possess multiple AATs. For example, AtBAT1 is a bi-directional transporter which is a possible exporter for certain AAs [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while AtCAT5 prefer basic AAs, and AtCAT3, AtCAT6 and AtCAT8 prefer neutral or acidic AAs [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Among the peptide and oligopeptide transporter genes, <italic>JcPTR</italic>, <italic>JcOPT5</italic>, and <italic>JcPTR3</italic> showed increased expression in leaves. In Arabidopsis, AtPTR proteins carry di- and tri-peptides, while AtOPTs transport tetra- and penta-peptides, and glutathione [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our data thus suggest that organic N transporter activities increased under conditions of N deficiency, leading to an increase in the degradation of organic N-containing compounds and export of the resulting products from source organs (leaves) to sink organs in order to enable the latter to deal with the consequences of N starvation.</p><p>The interconnections between C fixation and N metabolism are complex. C skeleton and substantial amount of energy needed for N reduction derive from photosynthesis, photorespiration and respiration [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, concentrations of sugars and starch increased or remained unchanged under N deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We observed that few genes encoding PSII component underwent changes in expression in leaves during mid- or long-term N limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). On the other hand, the degradation of AAs and proteins release large quantities of C skeleton that can cause a C/N imbalance. A high C/N ratio can induce anthocyanin accumulation, which is one of the traits typically observed under N deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our study, genes associated with the biosynthesis of terpenoid back-bones, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids were dramatically up-regulated after 16 d; these genes included three <italic>JcCHSs</italic> and two <italic>JcCHIs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). The phytohormone JA can play pivotal roles in C and secondary metabolism. In our profiling analysis, six genes encoding component of the JA biosynthesis pathway were strongly up-regulated under N deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). JA not only works as an elicitor to increase the accumulation of secondary metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182700.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but also induces AA reallocation from leaves towards roots [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In reproductive stage wheat, <italic>AOC</italic> and <italic>OPR</italic>, which encode enzymes of JA biosynthesis, were expressed at higher levels in all organs under low N [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We therefore suppose that increased JA signaling led to anthocyanin accumulation, chlorophyll degradation and acceleration of AA reallocation. JA signaling can recruit some members of the NAC, bHLH, R2R3-MYB, and WRKY families [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In our profiles, the genes for several TFs in the MYB and WRKY families were up-regulated after 16 d of nitrogen starvation, showing patterns similar to those of genes related to secondary metabolism and AATs. In Arabidopsis, some MYBs controlled the accumulation of anthocyanins and flavonoids in leaves under conditions of N depletion [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and regulated the expression of N assimilation genes, such as <italic>AtGS</italic> and <italic>AtASN</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. <italic>AtLBD 37/38/39</italic> genes negatively regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis, N uptake and assimilation [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We found that JcLBD37 was down-regulated at 16 d in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4G</xref>).</p><p>There is no doubt that N limitation has a major effect on cell structure. Ribosomes play regulatory roles in development [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Expression of genes associated with protein synthesis and of RP genes was reduced under N stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), possibly leading to inadequate biosynthesis of protein components including certain enzymes in roots. EXPs, PNP, and XTHs are types of cell wall protein [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Expression of <italic>JcEXPs</italic> and <italic>JcXTHs</italic> in both leaves and roots was greatly reduced after 16 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), whereas expression of <italic>JcPNAs</italic> in leaves increased at the same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). GA signaling was inhibited by the down-regulated of <italic>GA3OX1</italic> and four <italic>GASAs</italic> that interact with the negative receptor GID1B were up-regulated in leaves. <italic>GASA</italic> genes are implicated in cellular processes such as cell division and expansion [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These results suggested that cellular development in both organs was repressed under N deficit. ET inhibits primary root elongation, and ERF1 can stimulate auxin accumulation and ethylene-induced inhibition of root growth [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. ERF1 is also a downstream component in both ET and JA signaling and is involved in pathogen resistance [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. <italic>JcACO5</italic> and <italic>JcACO1</italic>, which encode enzymes of in ET synthesis, and <italic>JcETR1</italic>, showed increased expression at 2 d but their expression was repressed at 16 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting that primary root elongation was released from inhibition by ET signaling under long-term N-starvation, with a concomitant reduction in pathogen resistance. Further investigation into the potential role of N deficiency-induced cell wall modifications may shed light upon host-pathogen-phytohormone interactions. Other TFs also play important extensive roles in cell structure. <italic>PtaLBD4</italic> and <italic>PtaLBD1</italic> are specifically up-regulated in secondary phloem in poplar [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We found that <italic>JcLBD4</italic> was increased after 16 d in roots. <italic>NACs</italic> are involved in developmental programs, senescence, formation of secondary walls, and biotic and abiotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. <italic>JcNAC74</italic> increased at both 2 d and 16 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Long-term N starvation promotes the expressions of <italic>AtNF&#x02212;YA2, 3, 5, 7</italic>, and <italic>10</italic> in Arabidopsis, and plants over-expressing <italic>AtNF&#x02212;YA2/7/10</italic> have a dwarf phenotype caused by the impairment of cell elongation and they accumulate higher starch content [<xref rid="pone.0182700.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. <italic>JcNF&#x02212;YA3, 5</italic>, and <italic>10</italic> were up-regulated mainly in roots, and <italic>JcNF&#x02212;YA7, 10</italic> transcripts increased in leaves in response to N deficiency (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g003">3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182700.g004">4G</xref>). The activation of <italic>JcNF&#x02212;YA10</italic> could be associated with abnormal growth under N deficiency.
