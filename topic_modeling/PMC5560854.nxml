Evaluation of the total fat mass but also of the distribution between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue are important factors while assessing the pathophysiology of these two pathologies. Computed tomography (CT) and bioimpedance (BIS) are the translational methods the most frequently used in human beings as well as in rodent models in longitudinal studies on adiposity and obesity. Surprisingly, no direct comparison of micro-CT and BIS was reported yet in mice. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate and compare the accuracy and the uncertainty of measurement of micro-CT and BIS in this species.</p><p>The proportion of fat mass was measured with BIS, micro-CT and direct post-mortem tissue weight, and correlations between the data were established to evaluate the accuracy of the methods but also the uncertainty of BIS and micro-CT.</p><p>There were significant correlations between weights of fat tissues on scale and proportion of total fat mass determined by BIS or micro-CT (r = 0.81 and 0.86 respectively) but both methods overestimated the total fat mass, especially in the smallest animals; overestimation of fat mass was amplified with BIS compared to micro-CT. In addition BIS and micro-CT were highly correlated (r = 0.94). Test-test reliability showed a greater variability of the BIS with respect to the micro-CT (coefficient of variation = 17.2 vs 5.6% respectively). Hence, as far as subtle differences between groups or changes within one group are awaited, micro-CT may appear as the most reliable method for determination of fat mass in mice. Micro-CT, unlike BIS, will also allow to qualitatively and quantitatively differentiate between subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues, which is of major importance in studies on adiposity and its complications.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since its first description by Reaven in 1988 [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as &#x0201c;Syndrome X&#x0201d;, prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is in constant increase all over the world [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Between 1998 and 2009, several definitions of the metabolic syndrome have been proposed by different expert groups [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], all of them holding abdominal obesity as one of the diagnosis criterion. In its new worldwide definition of metabolic syndrome, the International Diabetes Federation [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] even retained central obesity as a mandatory criterion for diagnosis. Indeed, obesity is associated with a high risk of death by cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, several studies have suggested that changes in regional distribution of adipose tissues rather than obesity represent risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Hence, obese patients display worse metabolic profile when abdominal obesity is associated with an excess of visceral adipose tissue than when it is associated with an excess of subcutaneous fat tissue [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These observations led Haffner [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Despres <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to highlight the importance of being able to evaluate the amount of total adipose tissue and especially visceral adipose tissue, more than obesity in general.</p><p>In humans, the simplest and fastest methods to estimate the presence or absence of obesity are (i) the calculation of body mass index (BMI), defined as the ratio of weight (kg) to height (m<sup>2</sup>) and (ii) the measurement of waist circumference (cm). If the BMI allows to classify the population in underweight (BMI&#x0003c;18,5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal (18,5&#x02264;BMI&#x0003c;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (25&#x02264;BMI&#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obese (&#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), the relationship between BMI and the proportion of body fat depends largely on age, gender and ethnicity [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the same way, Despres <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported that waist circumference is a better predictor of visceral adipose tissue than BMI. For a long time, the gold standards for the quantification of total adipose tissue and especially visceral adipose tissue have been X-Ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, these two imaging methods are expensive and need specialized staff and specific installations; CT also exposes patients to ionizing radiations. Due to these disadvantages, new methods based on impedance measures were developed, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., single or multiple frequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS). These methods are non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, portable and do not require extensive operator training; therefore, they are increasingly used to assess body composition in many clinical applications, as prognostic indicator of disease severity, morbidity, hydration status, malnutrition or lymphedema [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, if conventional BIS gives the proportion of adipose tissue, it does not provide information on the distribution of adipose tissue within the body. Recently, a new dual-BIA instrument has been developed to assess intra-abdominal fat area and subcutaneous fat area, by measuring truncal impedance and surface impedance at the abdomen [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>As stated above, obesity seems to play a crucial role in the development of metabolic syndrome, but despite intensive research, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved remain poorly understood and efficient anti-obesity treatments are still lacking. Rodent animal models are the most largely used in preclinical studies to identify pathophysiological mechanisms and new therapeutical strategies for obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia or metabolic syndrome. The determination of adipose tissue proportion and distribution in these animals is therefore very important. Furthermore, since these pathologies usually evolve over several months, methods allowing longitudinal follow-up of the animals are needed.</p><p>The first method to determine the animal total fat mass (FM) is to recover and weigh all adipose tissues after sacrifice. Logically, this method does not allow to follow the evolution of the fat mass in the same animal over time. Another way to reach the proportion of fat mass is by using isotopic dilution. Animals are injected deuterium-labeled water (D<sub>2</sub>O) and/or H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O; the monitoring of the kinetics of deuterium (and/or <sup>18</sup>O) equilibration and disappearance allows the calculation of the total body water (TBW), then the deduction of the fat-free mass (FFM) and the FM [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This method has been used in many animal species, including rats, but since it requires repeated blood sampling, it is hardly applicable to the longitudinal follow-up of mice. Moreover, as far as translational studies are concerned, it may appear more appropriate to use the same method of body composition analysis in animals and humans. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) have also been used successfully to quantify the FFM and FM, but they do not provide spatial distribution of adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. X-Ray micro-computed tomography (&#x003bc;CT) is a well-established method since about ten years to determine adipose tissue proportion in rodents [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Advantages of &#x003bc;CT are multiple: it is non-invasive and relatively quick, enables repeated measurements over time in the same animal and provides detailed spatial information on body fat distribution. Limits are the image processing (manual or semi-automatic fat segmentation), which is time consuming, and exposure to ionizing radiation. Finally, over the last decade, the use of BIS to determine the body composition in small animals has spread from rat models [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to mouse models [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Similarly to &#x003bc;CT, this method is rapid; additional advantages are the low cost and the possibility to obtain at once the proportion of the different body compartments (TBW, FFM and FM). However, the procedure is more invasive than &#x003bc;CT due to the placement of needles and devices designed for BIS measurements in small animals do not allow to differentiate the various adipose tissues.</p><p>Accuracy of &#x003bc;CT and BIS in rodents have been validated by comparing values of body composition obtained with reference techniques. Hence, quantification of adiposity by &#x003bc;CT was mostly compared to direct post-mortem weighing of abdominal and subcutaneous fat pads [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and more recently, to in vivo qNMR in mice [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; body composition evaluated by BIS was correlated to values obtained by isotopic dilution and chemical carcass analysis [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To our knowledge, there is however no report of a comparison between &#x003bc;CT and BIS in mice. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate and compare the accuracy and the uncertainty of measurement of &#x003bc;CT and BIS in this species. For this purpose, the proportion of adipose tissue was measured with these two methods and by direct post-mortem tissue weigh, and correlations between the data were established. Intra-mouse variations were also calculated. These data may help identifying the most adapted method according to the pursued objectives, and thus making the choice between &#x003bc;CT and BIS when designing a new study in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 51 male C57Bl/6J mice were housed in standard conditions (12 hours light/dark cycle, temperature controlled) and had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. A first group of 5 mice was used to determine the density of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (see below). A second group comprising 24 mice was defined, in which fat mass (FM) was evaluated by BIS, &#x003bc;CT and in some of them, adipose tissue weight (see below); data served for the evaluation of uncertainty of the BIS and &#x003bc;CT methods (Study 1, n = 3) and for the analysis of the correlations between the different methods of measurement of FM (Study 2, n = 21).

In clinical research, only two studies have compared these two methods [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Both reported strong correlations between the different methods. However, Park <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] showed significant overestimation of visceral adipose tissue by dual-BIA in the larger ranges of values of fat mass. Surprisingly, no direct comparison of &#x003bc;CT and BIS was reported yet in mice.</p><p>First, we developed a semi-automated method for the segmentation and quantification of adipose tissues by &#x003bc;CT. Discrimination of fat from other tissues is achieved by applying a threshold in Hounsfield units that isolates density voxels of fat tissue from the others. Consequently, reliability of fat mass measurements relies on the choice of the most appropriate threshold. In our experiments, the threshold value was determined by matching the mass of a sample of harvested fat to the volume calculated by &#x003bc;CT and converted into mass using 0.92 mg/mL as fat density value. This value was measured with our density meter and is the same as that used by others [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The main interest of this first work is to have developed a semi-automated method for the segmentation which is independent of the operator; of note, threshold ranges used to discriminate tissues, as well as total fat and lean volumes obtained in mice were similar to values reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We also ensured that the total adipose tissue volume determined using our procedure was not overestimated by the respiratory movements of the animals and the presence of air within lung tissues. Approaches to limit miscategorizing of lung air as adipose tissue are (i) to perform respiratory-gated acquisitions or (ii) to perform manual segmentation around the lung area. After analyzing our data with and without synchronization and for each case, with and without manual segmentation, we did not observe any significant differences in the measured proportion of total adipose tissue in the thoracic region. The maximal error between the different conditions was about 2%, which is within the range of variability of the &#x003bc;CT procedure (1.2&#x02013;5.6%). These data suggest that both corrections, which are time consuming and considerably lengthen the duration of the whole &#x003bc;CT procedure, are not required in mice. Since duration is usually regarded as a major limit of the method, this result may represent a strong argument favoring the use of &#x003bc;CT in mice.</p><p>To validate the accuracy of &#x003bc;CT and BIS in mice and compare the two methods, total adipose tissue was evaluated by &#x003bc;CT or BIS and values were matched to the mass of adipose tissue resected at autopsy of the animals.</p><p>FM proportions estimated by &#x003bc;CT and BIS over a large range of values were strongly correlated (r = 0.94); of note, BIS values were slightly (3%) higher than &#x003bc;CT values and, more importantly, were more fluctuating than &#x003bc;CT values. Hence, for a FM measured by &#x003bc;CT settled at 20%, BIS displayed FM values varying from 14% to 22% (-30% to +10%); in contrast, for a FM measured by BIS settled at 20%, &#x003bc;CT values varied from -10% to +15% only. Total FM obtained by &#x003bc;CT or BIS was also highly correlated with the weight of harvested adipose tissue (r = 0.86 and r = 0.81, respectively). This is in agreement with previous studies which validated &#x003bc;CT measurement of adipose tissue against partially [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and completely [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] resected adipose tissue weights or compared the mass of total adipose tissue obtained by BIS with that obtained by chemical analysis carcass [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In all cases, very good correlations were reported, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.91 to 0.99. However, when calculating a theoretical fat mass from the BIS or &#x003bc;CT data and animals body weight, we noticed that both methods overestimated the fat mass, especially in the smallest animals, and that overestimation was amplified with BIS compared to &#x003bc;CT (theoretical fat mass ranging from 3.5-6g and 3.2&#x02013;4.2g for BIS and &#x003bc;CT respectively, in mice with 1.8g of fat measured at autopsia). Similar findings were reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. One possible explanation may reside in the difficulty of harvesting all the fat, particularly in the abdominal region, leading to underestimation of the total fat mass in animals. This, however, holds true for both methods and can therefore not account for the differences observed between BIS and &#x003bc;CT. A plausible explanation for this difference is the higher variability of the BIS measurements. While assessing the reliability of the two methods, we found coefficients of variation three times higher for BIS than for &#x003bc;CT. This can be explained by the fact that the value given by BIS, unlike &#x003bc;CT, is extremely dependent on the hydration animal status, the position of the animal and the placement of the needle electrodes [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In agreement, FM values varied considerably over 15 independent measurements (3x/day, 5 consecutive days), with a coefficient of variation of 17%. Our data show that the time of measurement represents the most important factor of variability (CV = 13.6&#x000b1;7.0% for data obtained at morning, noon and afternoon), most probably reflecting changes in the nutrition and hydration status of animal along the day. Thus, performing BIS evaluation always at the same time seems crucial to improve reliability. The influence of the time of measurements is much less pronounced for &#x003bc;CT. Based on our results we cannot reject the importance of measuring at the same time although for &#x003bc;CT. In the BIS procedure, accuracy in the determination of the distance between B and C electrodes also plays a key role. This length, together with age and body mass of the animal, is used for the calculation of the different parameters given by the device. Small differences in the measurement of this distance may produce large fluctuations in the calculated FM, accounting for high variations of the BIS method. Moreover, accuracy of the distance measurement likely decreases in small animals, which could contribute to the enhanced variability in this particular population. Finally, we noticed that intrinsic variability of BIS is much higher in animals with low FM: coefficients of variation within one session (30 continuous measurements during 30 seconds) were 8.6 to 19% in animals with low FM (13&#x02013;15%) versus 2.7 to 6.7% in animals with high FM (35&#x02013;38%). Although not fully understood, this observation may also partly explain why BIS overestimation was enhanced in small animals. In their studies using &#x003bc;CT, Hillebrand <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Lubura <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] noticed CV values of the same range than ours (4.5 and 2.2% vs 1.2 to 5.6%, respectively). Looking at BIS variability, a day-to-day variation of 3.5% has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], in accordance with the CV obtained in the present study (3.5&#x000b1;2.2). In contrast, Smith <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] found a CV of 5.4% on 2 successive sessions performed on the same day, after repositioning the needle electrodes, compared to our value of 13.6% on 3 successive scans. This large discrepancy may be explained by the fact that in their study, animals were not awakened between the two successive sessions, while in our study, animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia during several hours and were placed in their own cage with full access to food and water before repeating the measurement.</p><p>Finally, animal body weight and FM estimated by BIS and &#x003bc;CT were significantly correlated. However, the calculated coefficients of correlation were relatively low (r = 0.55 for both methods) and, for a same given body weight, the proportions of total fat mass varied greatly (even from single to double in some cases), irrespective of the method used. These data confirm that body weight <italic>per se</italic> is not a good prognostic factor for the presence of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In order to validate &#x003bc;CT as a valuable tool for the long-term follow-up of mice, we designed a study in which animals were proned to develop obesity through enriched diet. In all animals, the proportion of FM was evaluated on one day at the same time, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., in conditions which were set as the most reliable (CV = 1.2&#x000b1;0.3%). As expected in adult mice under normal diet, the proportion of FM increased only moderately over the 15 weeks (+2.5%), but the difference was beyond the detection threshold of the &#x003bc;CT. In contrast, enriched diet induced a 2-fold increase in total FM. These data confirm that &#x003bc;CT represents a precise and suitable tool for detecting moderate as well as large increases in FM in mice over a long period of time. In addition and in agreement with our conclusion, Upadhyay <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183523.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] demonstrated that &#x003bc;CT is also valuable to highlight small (&#x0003c;10%) reductions in the amount of white adipose tissue induced by pharmacological treatments.</p><p>In summary, our data show that BIS and &#x003bc;CT are two valid methods to assess the proportion of fat mass in mouse models of obesity or metabolic syndrome. However, BIS values display a much greater variability, limiting its sensitivity. Hence, as far as subtle (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., &#x0003c; 5&#x02013;10%) differences between groups or changes within one group are awaited, &#x003bc;CT may appear as the most reliable method for determination of FM. &#x003bc;CT, unlike BIS, will also allow to qualitatively and quantitatively differentiate between subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues, which is of major importance in studies on adiposity and its complications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Isabelle Chery, Alexandre Zahariev and Stephane Blanc (D&#x000e9;partement d&#x02019;Ecologie, Physiologie, et Ethologie, Institut Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, UMR 7178 CNRS, University of Strasburg, France) for the BIS device and their technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0183523.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Reaven</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name>. <article-title>Banting lecture 1988 Role of insulin resistance in human disease</article-title>. <source>Diabetes</source>. <year>1988</year>;<volume>37</volume>(<issue>12</issue>):<fpage>1595</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>607</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3056758</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0183523.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zimmet</surname><given-names>PZ</given-names></name>. <article-title>The metabolic syndrome: prevalence in worldwide populations</article-title>. <source>Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am</source>. <year>2004</year>;<volume>33</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>351</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>75</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecl.2004.03.005">10.1016/j.ecl.2004.03.005</ext-link></comment>
