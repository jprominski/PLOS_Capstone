Therefore, social interest in the fields of health, longevity, and anti-aging has been increasing as well. However, the basic research results obtained from a reductionist approach in biology and a bioinformatic approach in genome science have limited usefulness for generating insights on future health, longevity, and anti-aging-related research on a case by case basis. We propose a new approach that uses our literature mining technique and bioinformatics, which lead to a better perspective on research trends by providing an expanded knowledge base to work from. We demonstrate that our approach provides useful information that deepens insights on future trends which differs from data obtained conventionally, and this methodology is already paving the way for a new field in aging-related research based on literature mining. One compelling example of this is how our new approach can be a useful tool in drug repositioning.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research is partially supported by the Platform Project for Supporting Drug Discovery and Life Science Research (Basis for Supporting Innovative Drug Discovery and Life Science Research [BINDS]) from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>A lot of work has been done in the fields of health, longevity, and anti-aging since long-lived strains in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> were first isolated [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, the human genome project was completed in 2003 [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and it has fundamentally altered methods of researching biological and physiological phenomena. It has also provided a vast amount of data to the research community. However, it is questionable whether this data is being used effectively in our quest to understand aging and longevity. Basic research results obtained from a reductionist approach in biology and a bioinformatic approach in genome science have limited usefulness for generating insights on future health, longevity, and anti-aging-related research on a case by case basis.</p><p>Bioinformatic analyses are used to provide information overviews, and extract valuable data by collecting and analyzing an extensive amount of information derived from various sources, including microarray [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183534.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and literature data [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The bioinformatic method has been incorporated into data analyses in biology, nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and medical science [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as well as aging research [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183534.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which explains why research terms such as translational bioinformatics [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183534.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], health informatics [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183534.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and biomedical informatics [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183534.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have been defined and used on par with the newly coined term &#x02018;bioinformatics&#x02019;. These terms no longer describe fledgling disciplines but rather firmly established fields. However, the limits of reductionism still remain.</p><p>Deep learning as a machine-learning technique may have the potential to manage the limitations of reductionism on biological and physiological data and provides new insights on research trends [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This technique is capable of discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Therefore, it is applicable to many domains of science. For example, deep learning was used to predict the activity of potential drug molecule [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, deep learning comprises layers of features that are not designed by human engineers. These layers are obtained using a general-purpose learning procedure of machine learning. For this reason, only the input provided by the researcher and the results gained from machine-learning are observed. Thus, this technique may sometimes provide unsatisfactory results because researchers usually pursue the question of &#x0201c;Why?&#x0201d; in the world of science. For example, even if aging-related genes are identified based on deep learning, the reasons why these aging-related genes were selected as genes related to aging will remain unclear.</p><p>In order to overcome the limitations of reductionism in this study, we implemented a new approach that incorporates bioinformatics into the literature mining method. Unlike results obtained solely from deep learning, this new approach provides an explanation as to why genes are selected as aging-related genes, and which genes should be focused on in future research. Furthermore, our approach is not confined to aging research and can provide new insights into various research fields, by the effective use of an expanded knowledge base.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>It is indispensable to identify all aging-related genes involved in the aging phenomenon to comprehend the mechanisms of aging. In addition, overviewing the causal relationship between aging, disease, food, and lifestyle using these identified aging-related genes can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of aging, which will ultimately lead to the realization of healthy longevity. First, we identified aging-related genes by using our data mining techniques that identify the latest aging-related genes efficiently, effectively and comprehensively. Next, in order to verify the identified aging-related genes, we made a comparison to other aging-related databases. Then, in order to verify the usefulness of our new approach, we made a comparison between knowledge obtained via our new approach and data obtained via wet experiments. Finally, we demonstrated that our approach leads to a better perspective on research trends by providing an expanded knowledge base to work from. It can be observed that this methodology is already paving the way for a new field based on literature mining in aging-related research.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Identifying aging-related genes</title><p>Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased susceptibility to death.

Are the 3,189 genes that were not selected on the &#x02018;single sentence&#x02019; criterion true aging-related genes? The answer to this question will provide clues to the most useful criteria to use when identifying aging-related genes. In statistics, a confidence interval can be used to describe how reliable survey results are.

Similarly, we randomly chose 4 more different sets of 127 genes, and we obtained the following confidence intervals: 82.6% to 93.8%, 87.4% to 96.8%, 88.5% to 97.4%, 90.5% to 98.5%. We have decided whether the genes that we selected randomly are true aging-related genes, by examining the relationships between genes and aging-related terms in abstract texts. When this technique used, some aging-related genes may appear as false positives. Consequently, the lower limit of the confidence interval is likely to be greater than 82.6% when considering the entire paper rather than just the abstract. On this basis, we decided that it would be best to use &#x02018;the same abstract&#x02019; as the criterion for identifying aging-related genes.</p><p>In order to obtain a more comprehensive list of aging-related genes, we not only used literature mining, but we also used the pathway hypothesis, which states that a gene is an aging-related gene if it occurs in the same pathway as a pre-established aging-related gene. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that genes involved in the same biological phenomenon belong to the same pathway. We identified 1,339 additional aging-related candidate genes based on the pathway hypothesis. We also did an in-depth investigation of one of these additional candidate genes, which is the TNF receptor associated factor 5 (TRAF5) gene. It occurs in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway (hsa04064) of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) gene, which was identified as an aging-related gene by our literature mining technique. The NF-kappa B activation has been reported as a hallmark of the aging process [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported that TRAF5 regulates the IL-6R signaling needed for Th17 development [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and the Th17/Treg balance is disturbed during aging [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results suggest the following: one is that TRAF5 is an aging-related gene, and the other is that extracting genes that occur in the same pathway as aging-related genes is a valid method for identifying the highest number of aging-related genes.</p><p>However, if pre-selected aging-related genes identified by literature mining include false positives, aging-related genes identified based on the pre-selected aging-related genes are likely to include false positives as well. Therefore, the research strategy may be determined on the basis of the researcher&#x02019;s aims. Some researchers may favor the highest number of results whereas others will favor the most accurate results. For example, the following strategy can be adopted to reduce false positives and accurately select aging-related genes: identify reliable aging-related genes by intentionally using restricted criteria and then select genes located on the same pathway as the pre-selected aging-related genes to identify the highest number of aging-related genes.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Verifying aging-related genes</title><p>In order to verify identified aging-related genes, the data from four public databases were used: GenAge [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], AgeFactDB [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Digital Ageing Atlas [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (hereafter called &#x02018;Atlas&#x02019;), AGEMAP [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this study, because we focused on protein-coding genes obtained from human gene data, non-human and non-protein-coding genes in these databases were removed as verification data. For example, a non-coding RNA gene telomerase RNA component (TERC) was excluded from GenAge, and 304 genes out of 305 genes in GenAge were used. Additionally, 6,742 human homologous genes corresponding to 8,932 mouse genes in AGEMAP were used.</p><p>We checked whether the identified aging-related genes covered all of the genes in GenAge, because GenAge offers benchmark data for aging-related genes. By incorporating pathway information, the coverage of the genes in GenAge was increased from 90.1% (274 genes) to 94.4% (287 genes) for co-occurrences in a single sentence and from 96.1% (292 genes) to 99.0% (301 genes) for co-occurrences in the same abstract (see the second column from the right in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183534.t002">Table 2</xref>).

A possible explanation for this is that though these genes did not co-occur with our 14 selected terms, they may have co-occurred with other aging-related diseases.

In order to include so many aspects of aging research, we selected a wide range of aging-related terms, which are involved in aging, anti-aging, and health longevity as candidate terms, and which also occurred frequently in PubMed abstracts about aging. In this paper, we regard a gene as an aging-related gene if it co-occurs with at least one of these aging-related terms in a single sentence or the same abstract. In order to reduce false positives, we considered a method that can cover more aging-related genes using fewer aging-related terms. By viewing a histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183534.g005">Fig 5</xref>), we were able to see that 45 aging-related terms were both necessary and sufficient to identify all aging-related genes. In this graph, we can see that, by using the terms from &#x02018;aging&#x02019; to &#x02018;age-dependence&#x02019; exclusively, the cumulative number of aging-related genes that correspond to our 45 aging-related terms is 7,416. This indicates that our 45 aging-related terms are sufficient to identify all of the aging-related genes needed to meet our research objectives.</p><fig id="pone.0183534.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183534.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Histogram representing the cumulative number of aging-related genes.</title><p>The blue bars show the number of aging-related genes for each individual term and the orange line represents the cumulative number of aging-related genes identified by the terms progressively.

We questioned whether they should be considered aging-related terms. We identified 8,582-related genes by using only &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183534.g006">Fig 6</xref>. 2,808 of them did not co-occur with any of the 45 aging-related terms chosen, and 5,774 of them had already been identified in the group of 7,416 aging-related genes. This means that every one of those 5,774 genes co-occurred with at least one of the 45 aging-related terms, aside from healthy, in the same abstract. Incidentally, 1,642 out of 7,416 aging-related genes were not identified by using &#x02018;healthy&#x02019;. This means that though the term &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; can identify a wide range of genes, is too versatile to identify specific genes. This study is aimed at clarifying the mechanisms of aging and making healthy longevity attainable. While the 5,774 genes are likely to be involved in both aging and healthy longevity, the additional 2,808 genes widen the scope beyond that. We have decided not to use &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; as an aging-related term, or consider the 2,808 new genes, which were identified by using &#x02018;healthy&#x02019;, as healthy longevity genes related to aging for this reason. If the scope of the research requires it, these genes can be included. There are various types of aging-related research and we should choose aging-related terms according to their purpose. In our opinion, this potential flexibility is one powerful advantage of text mining. We found that the higher number of aging-related terms used, the higher the number of false positives present in the newly discovered aging-related genes. Therefore, we listed 45 aging-related terms that satisfy our requirements for avoiding both false positives and false negatives aging-related genes.</p><fig id="pone.0183534.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183534.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Histogram of the 14 terms that were discarded.</title><p>The blue bars show the number of genes that are included in the group of 7,416 aging-related genes identified by using 45 aging-related terms.

One is that a gene is an aging-related gene if it co-occurs with at least one of our pre-selected aging-related terms in a single sentence or the same abstract. Another is that a gene is an aging-related gene if it occurs in the same pathway as a pre-established aging-related gene. In order to guarantee the accuracy of identified aging-related genes we should choose the &#x02018;single sentence&#x02019; criterion. Conversely, in order to guarantee quantity, we should choose to use the pathway hypothesis. In this study, in order to guarantee both sufficient quantity and quality, we chose to use the 'same abstract' criterion, and identified 7, 416 aging-related genes, which consist of 4,227 aging related gene with co-occurrences in the same sentences, and 3,189 with co-occurrences in the same abstracts.</p><p>In Contrast, the classification of false positives depends on the focus of the research. Therefore, we determined that certain genes, which were not in alignment with our research objectives, were false positives. The tally of false positives is dependent on the criterion used to identify the aging-related genes. We randomly selected 845 out of the 4,227 genes (20%) and 638 out of the 3,189 genes (20%) in order to check for false positives, and we found that 41 and 53 genes were not aging-related genes, respectively. It is better to avoid giving a specific percentage, as the definition of false positives depends on the focus of the research. Our research gives false positives to some extent. Even when attempting to guarantee quality by using the single sentence criterion, false positives occur. Most of these false positives are due to gene symbol occurrences, because the gene symbol has the same spelling as acronyms, which symbolize other gene names or phrases unrelated to genes. In terms of reducing false positives, our study was successful to a certain extent. However, this will be the focus of our further research as more work is needed in this area.</p><p>In any case, one of the goals of this study is to propose genes that will be of interest to experimental researchers in the future. Whether genes can suppress or promote disease, it is important to recognize the fact that both types of genes have been attracting attention as research subjects. The advantage of text mining is that it can be used to gain high quality coverage. In addition, it is possible to narrow the focus down to genes of interest that match specific research objectives by using keywords, which are related to research objectives with a particular focus.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Comparison to other aging databases</title><p>Recently, several databases developed for aging-related genes have become widely accessible. In order to verify our identified aging-related genes, we compared them to aging-related genes in the following four databases: GenAge, AgeFactDB, Atlas, AgeMap. All the genes related to aging must be identified to understand the molecular mechanisms of aging and related diseases. The databases mentioned above are manually curated and provide information on high-quality aging-related genes, although they do not cover all of the genes that are associated with the aging process. However, because our approach is based on the scientific journal literature published to date, our database covers potential aging-related genes published so far.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Providing new insights</title><p>We investigated how many of our aging-related genes were used as target genes for known drugs, in order to demonstrate that our approach is an efficient tool for discovering new therapeutic indications for existing drugs. We found that 522 out of 7,146 aging-related genes that we identified using our literature mining approach are used as the target genes for known drugs. These genes can be used as a primary filter for discovering new uses for approved drugs. Metformin targets AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and has been used to treat diabetes since the 40&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It is currently in clinical trials as an anti-aging drug [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Genes known as AMPK are PRKAA1 and PRKAA2, and they are aging-related genes. Moreover, 38 out of 128 genes that co-occurred with 14 terms that are deeply related to aging are used as the target genes for known drugs. For example, the TLR2 gene is targeted by Erlotinib (DB00045), which is used to prevent Lyme Disease. This gene not only exists on pathways involved in aging and longevity such as MAPK signaling (hsa04010) and PI3K-Akt signaling (hsa04151), but it also exists on the following signaling pathways: leishmaniasis (hsa05140), malaria (hsa05144), toxoplasmosis (hsa05145), amoebiasis (hsa05146), tuberculosis (hsa05152), hepatitis B (hsa05161), measles (hsa05162), inflammatory bowel disease (hsa05321), rheumatoid arthritis (hsa05323), etc. TRL2 is clearly related to signaling pathways involved in aging and infection. The use of Erlotinib can be considered a possible treatment for aging-related diseases and infection-related diseases in the absence of contraindications related to side effects. For this reason, our approach is considered highly effective as a springboard to new discoveries that can lead to new therapeutic indications for existing drugs, commonly known as drug repositioning.</p><p>In this study, to overcome the limitations of reductionism, we implemented a new approach that incorporates bioinformatics in the literature mining method. The results obtained based on our approach can explain why genes are selected as aging-related genes and which genes should be focused on in future research. Furthermore, our approach can also provide new insights into various research fields, by the effective use of an expanded knowledge base. It would be also beneficial to collaborate with wet-lab researchers, in order to help them expedite the selection process for future research, and to fine tune our approach on the basis of their feedback.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Our approach consists of 3 parts: creating term dictionaries and literature databases, identifying aging-related genes, and classifying and providing an overview of the integrated information.

GenAge offers information on 305 aging-related genes and their PubMed IDs released in October 2015. Frequent terms relevant to aging and longevity in PubMed abstracts were extracted based on PubMed IDs, with the exclusion of general terms such as &#x02018;is&#x02019;, &#x02018;a&#x02019; and &#x02018;this&#x02019;.

In this study, the co-occurrence frequency of gene symbols and aging-related terms in the literature was used as the evaluation criteria for relationships between aging-related terms and genes. The higher the number of publications in which the gene and aging-related terms co-occurred, the more likely that the gene was an aging-related gene. Specifically, the following procedures were used:</p><p>First, all of the gene symbol occurrences were extracted from our non-redundant PubMed abstracts by performing a keyword search. Because gene symbols are generally created from the acronyms of gene names, certain symbols, such as the gene IMPACT (imprinted and ancient gene protein homolog), have the same spellings as general words, and these symbols may produce false positives in keyword searches. Therefore, in addition to the keyword search, additional gene symbol occurrence checks were performed, which are referred to as neighbor searches [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Neighbor searches check whether any of the words that have been abbreviated to form a symbol, which can be called a neighbor search word set, appear near the symbol in a single sentence. If any word from the neighbor search word set is found in the same sentence as the corresponding gene symbol, the occurrence is considered to be positive. The gene occurrence table consists of Gene IDs, PubMed IDs, and the sentence numbers where the corresponding gene symbols appear in the abstracts.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183534.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows an example of a neighbor search. Consider the case in which gene symbol ALK, Entrez Gene ID 238, occurs in an abstract. The gene names of ALK are anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase, CD246 antigen and mutant anaplastic lymphoma kinase. By splitting these gene names at the delimiters, we obtain a neighbor search word set: anaplastic, lymphoma, receptor, tyrosine, kinase, CD246, antigen and mutant. Among these words, receptor, tyrosine, kinase, antigen, and mutant are dropped as a neighbor search word set because they are not specific to ALK. Next, the neighbor search attempts to find any occurrence of one of these neighbor search words in the sentence in which ALK appears. In the first case, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183534.g007">Fig 7</xref> (PubMed ID = 7772531), we can see that the words anaplastic and lymphoma occur. On the other hand, in the second case (PubMed ID = 1522609), none of these words appear. Therefore, this occurrence of ALK is considered a false positive and is deleted from the gene occurrence table</p><fig id="pone.0183534.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183534.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>An example of a neighbor search.</title><p>For the gene names of ALK, the following neighbor search words are generated: anaplastic, lymphoma, and CD246.

In the second case (PubMed ID = 1522609), none of these neighbor search words appear. Therefore, this occurrence is discarded.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0183534.g007"/></fig><p>Next, the occurrence table for aging-related terms was created by performing a keyword search, which consisted of PubMed IDs and the sentence numbers where the corresponding aging-related terms appeared in the abstracts. Then, we regarded the co-occurrence of genes and aging-related terms in a single sentence as an association between the two. In addition, the range of term co-occurrence varied, such as in one document, one paragraph, a single sentence, and a string of words of a fixed length. In general, a broad range generates high recall and low-precision results. We chose to use a single sentence in the same abstract to guarantee the accuracy of our results for this study. However, certain genes with the potential for classification as aging-related genes were not selected based on the aforementioned criteria. To guarantee quantity over quality, the co-occurrence of genes and aging-related terms in the same abstract was considered an association between the two.</p><p>Furthermore, to identify the highest number of aging-related genes, the pathway hypothesis was applied, which states that a gene is an aging-related gene if it occurs in the same pathway as a pre-established aging-related gene. First, the KEGG database [<xref rid="pone.0183534.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], which provides information regarding molecular interactions, was checked for aging-related genes that co-occur in the same sentences as aging-related terms.
