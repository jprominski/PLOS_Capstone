It will be informative to understand the prevalence of multi drug resistance for a better drug regimen management in this geographical area. The Rifampicin resistance determining region (RRDR) sequencing was used to identify mutations associated with drug resistance in DNA extracts from 130 known multidrug resistant (MDR) cultured strains and compared with mutations observed in DNA extracts directly from 86 sputum samples from consecutive newly diagnosed cases in Lahore, Pakistan. These newly diagnosed samples were positive for smear microscopy, chest X-ray and presumed sensitive to first line drugs. In the known MDR group the most frequent mutations conferring resistance were found in <italic>rpo</italic>B531 (n = 51, 39.2%). In the newly diagnosed tuberculosis group with no history of MDR, mutations in <italic>rpo</italic>B531 were seen in 10 of the samples (11.6%). Collectively, all mutations in the RRDR region studied were observed in 80 (61.5%) of known MDR cases and in 14 (16.3%) of the newly diagnosed cases. Using the RRDR as a surrogate marker for MDR, sequences for the newly diagnosed (presumed sensitive) group indicate much higher levels of MDR than the 3.9% WHO 2015 global estimate and suggests that molecular screening directly from sputum is urgently required to effectively address the detection and treatment gaps to combat MDR in this high burden country.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Higher Education Commission Pakistan</institution></funding-source><award-id>1-8/HEC/HRD/2015/3697 PIN: IRSIP 28 BMS13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hameed</surname><given-names>Salma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Higher Education Commission, Pakistan (grant no: 1-8/HEC/HRD/2015/3697 PIN: IRSIP 28 BMS13).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information file.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information file.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pakistan is among the top 20 countries with a high TB and MDR-TB burden [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Chest X-ray, acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy and culture on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media are the conventional methods of investigation for tuberculosis [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] but require additional analysis to define the species of Mycobacteria as well as the mechanism of drug resistance. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> drug resistance detection using conventional methods is by culture of bacilli on a medium containing antibiotic and can require several weeks. However, with the development of rapid molecular methods it is possible to detect mutations in genes associated with resistance in a much shorter time [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Resistance to two first line predominant anti-TB drugs i.e., isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), is termed as &#x02018;multidrug resistance tuberculosis&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Molecular methods for this are diverse and each method has its benefits and drawbacks; for example PCR-RFLP [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and allele-specific PCR [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several molecular techniques have been evolved to detect the gene mutation related to resistance. These include hybridization methods; single strand polymorphism, DNA sequencing and other PCR based methods [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Multiplex Allele Specific (MAS) PCR, a rapid and cost-effective method simultaneously detects INH, RIF and Ethambutol (EMB) resistance associated genetic mutations [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. PCR technology can provide many advantages over traditional techniques. Many PCR tests can be rapidly performed and interpreted on the same day of submission of samples. A major advantage of PCR over traditional techniques includes the ability to rapidly identify organisms that are difficult to culture and the DNA of interest can be amplified with the DNA from just one cell. The sensitivity of PCR is also its major disadvantage since very small amounts of contaminating DNA (from a different sample) can also be amplified. One major limitation of PCR is that prior information about the target sequence is necessary in order to generate the primers that will allow its selective amplification [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) sequences the whole genome rather than specific genes. So, drug resistance prediction from the whole genome sequence is possible using publically available software which rapidly analyses all known gene targets and identifies mutations associated with resistance thus enabling targeted treatment [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but requires culture and is currently prohibitively expensive for high burden countries. Identification of MDR-TB is a crucial step as treatment of multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a considerable challenge. Globally in 2015, an estimated 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7&#x02013;5.1%) of new cases and 21% (95% CI: 15&#x02013;28%) of previously treated cases had MDR/RR-TB [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Resistance to rifampicin is the result of mutations in the rifampicin resistance determining region (RRDR) of <italic>rpo</italic>B, particularly mutations at codons 516, 526 and 531. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective anti-TB drugs. In December 2010, WHO recommended the use of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF to detect and infer resistance to rifampicin directly from sputum [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In May 2016, WHO issued guidance that &#x0201c;people with TB resistant to rifampicin, with or without resistance to other drugs, should be treated with an MDR-TB treatment regimen.&#x0201d; Together with MDR-TB, these are referred to as MDR/RR-TB.</p><p>This work was carried out in Pakistan to characterize mutations associated with rifampicin resistance directly from sputum samples from newly diagnosed (ND) patients with no history of drug resistance and identify their key risk factors in this setting. Identifying resistance in presumed resistant samples and inferring resistance profiles directly from sputum may enable a better tailored drug regimen where possible. It will also inform patient management more rapidly and consequently reduce the rate of onward transmission of MDR tuberculosis in high burden countries such as Pakistan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sampling</title><p>Tuberculosis patients attending the Ghulab Devi Chest Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan in collaboration with University of Health Sciences, Lahore were enrolled in this study over 18 months between 2013 and 2015, based on the following inclusion criteria.

To gain further information about the prevalence of MDR in newly diagnosed patients in this area of Lahore, Pakistan, the RRDR region of the <italic>rpo</italic>B gene from two groups was sequenced; the first group comprised extracted DNA from130 MDR strains from patients diagnosed previously with TB, and with a history of resistance to first line anti-tuberculosis drugs; the second group comprised 86, DNA extracts directly from sputum samples from consecutive newly diagnosed patients, with clinical symptoms of TB, positive in sputum smear microscopy AFB, chest X-ray positive and presumed drug susceptible with no history of resistance to any first line tuberculosis drugs. The most common mutation found in both groups was in line with other studies, i.e. at position 531, TCG&#x0003e;TTG/Ser&#x0003e;Leu, and at 61.3% and 57.1% for MDR and ND groups respectively, at a similar prevalence.</p><p>Studies indicate that 96.1% of the rifampicin resistant strains worldwide will have rpoB mutations (so a surrogate marker for MDR) studies [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183363.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Comparison of the DST results with the RRDR data from the MDR group in this study suggests that only 61.5% of strains carry mutations in this region of the <italic>rpo</italic>B gene so sequencing the RRDR does not correlate with rifampicin resistance as successfully. The reasons for this may be that resistance to rifampicin is conferred by mutations in other parts of the gene or genome or that the DST testing was sub optimal in some way and indicated resistance when none was present, although all patients from this group had a history of resistance to first line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Antimicrobial resistance testing (AST) or Drug resistance testing was established in the 1960s [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and there is no consensus reference method for MIC determination against which the different methods can be compared to determine common breakpoints.</p><p>The main finding of this study however is the high incidence of rifampicin resistance associated mutations, which is often used as a surrogate marker for MDR. At 16.3%, it is considerably higher than the WHO estimate of 3.9% of new cases of multi drug resistant tuberculosis [<xref rid="pone.0183363.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This single piece of study needs to be justified with the help of future studies to support a high percentage of rif resistant strains. The cost of rpoB sequencing in this study was approximately $10, the cost of a GeneXpert test in this region. The time taken to carry out rpoB sequencing is slightly longer than GeneXpert testing but requires more complex testing and analysis. GeneXpert testing or rpoB sequencing for detection of MDR TB in sputum samples is much faster than waiting for results of culture and DST. The diagnosis and effective treatment for individuals with MDR needs to be tailored and administered quickly by rapid molecular tests and, as a consequence of that, the control of transmission of MDR tuberculosis will be tightened. Only then will MDR tuberculosis infection and transmission be effectively controlled in high incidence areas such as Pakistan, where it is most needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183363.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Alignment of RRDR sequences from this research work.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183363.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0183363.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">WHO.
