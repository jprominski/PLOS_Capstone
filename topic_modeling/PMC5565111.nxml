The combination of siramesine, a lysosome disruptor, and lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to synergistically induce cell death in breast cancer cells mediated by ferroptosis. These treatments also induce autophagy but its role in this synergistic cell death is unclear. In this study, we determined that siramesine and lapatinib initially induced ferroptosis but changes to an autophagy induced cell death after 24 hours. Furthermore, we found that intracellular iron level increased in a time dependent manner following treatment accompanied by an increase in ROS. Using the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) or the ROS scavenger alpha-tocopherol decreased both autophagy flux and cell death. We further discovered that decreased expression of the iron storage protein, ferritin was partially dependent upon autophagy degradation. In contrast, the expression of transferrin, which is responsible for the transport of iron into cells, is increased following treatment with lapatinib alone or in combination with siramesine. This indicates that ferroptosis and autophagy induced cell death occur independently but both are mediated by iron dependent ROS generation in breast cancer cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009395</institution-id><institution>CancerCare Manitoba Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0119-732X</contrib-id><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>Spencer B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000147</institution-id><institution>Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0119-732X</contrib-id><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>Spencer B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by an operating grant from the CancerCare Manitoba Foundation and the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, Prairie/NWT Chapter.

Inhibiting the cystine-glutamate antiporter (system X<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) causes the depletion of glutathione (GSH), the major cellular antioxidant [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This leads to ferroptosis through the loss of cellular redox homeostasis. In addition, alterations in iron transport proteins increases iron mediated ROS that also leads to ferroptosis [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This illustrates the central role ROS plays in regulating ferroptosis.</p><p>Autophagy an intracellular catabolic process involving lysosomes that could lead to programmed cell death through extensive degradation of intracellular structures or organelles [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Autophagy is usually characterized by the formation of double membranes called autophagosomes. These autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes forming autolysosomes where degradation occurs [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similar to ferroptosis, this process is regulated by ROS levels as increased oxidative stress leads to autophagy induce cell death. In recent reports, autophagy contributes to ferroptosis through degradation of the iron-storage protein, ferritin [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ferritin is a universal intracellular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion. Degradation of ferritin cause increased iron levels leading to accumulation of ROS in cells ultimately leading to cell death. Whether ferroptosis and autophagy induced cell death are dependent upon each other is currently not well understood.</p><p>We have found that siramesine disrupts lysosome membranes leading to cell death and in combination with lapatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2) induces ferroptosis in breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This occurs through inhibiting the iron transport system leading to an increased in ROS and cell death. In addition, both siramesine and lapatinib induce autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182921.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but the role of autophagy in siramesine and lapatinib induced synergistic cell death is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of ferroptosis and autophagy on siramesine and lapatinib induced cell death and the role of intracellular iron and ROS plays in regulating both ferroptosis and autophagy induced cell death in breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Siramesine and lapatinib induced ferroptosis and autophagic cell death at different times</title><p>To determine whether the extent of ferroptosis, apoptosis or autophagy induced cell death following siramesine and lapatinib treatment, we pretreated MDA MB 231 and SKBR3 cells with ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, ferroptosis inhibitor), 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) or Z-VAD (apoptosis inhibitor) and determined the amount of cell death.

In this study, we found that siramesine and lapatinib induce both ferroptosis and autophagy induced cell death at different times after treatment. Similarly, we have previously demonstrated that autophagy will initially promote cell survival but elevated and prolonged autophagy will promote cell death under hypoxia [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Siramesine and lapatinib treatment increased intracellular iron levels and ROS over 24 hours and ROS scavengers effectively blocked both ferroptosis and autophagy induced cell death. This indicates that different types of cell death can be favored at different times following treatment in breast cancer cells.</p><p>Autophagy is an important catabolic process that delivers cytoplasmic material to the lysosome for degradation [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It also plays a significant role in regulating iron balance in cells, through the degradation of ferritin [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Ferritin is controls the removal of excess iron from the cytoplasm and stores iron in its non-redox active form [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, ferritin has been shown to be degraded in cells by lysosomal acid hydrolases and it is known that ferritin enters lysosomes through the autophagic pathway [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182921.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Entry of ferritin is also independent of the presence of LAMP-2A, which suggests that ferritin entry does not result from chaperone-mediated autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In agreement with this, we found that LAMP-2A and LC3 fails to co-localized following siramesine and lapatinib treatment indicating siramesine and lapatinib fail to induce chaperone-mediated autophagy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182921.s017">S17 Fig</xref>). Our results demonstrate that ferritin degradation is at least partially due to autophagy suggesting it might regulate ROS and cell death following siramesine and lapatinib treatment.</p><p>Ferroptosis is dependent upon intracellular iron and prevented by lipophilic antioxidants, such as trolox and vitamin E, and by iron chelators such as deferoxamine but not by well-known small-molecule inhibitors of apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The relationship between autophagy and ferroptosis remains unclear. Autophagy could promote ferroptosis by degradation of ferritin, a process known as ferritinophagy [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182921.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Using RNAi screening, researchers have identified multiple autophagy-related genes as positive regulators of ferroptosis [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One of these genes is cargo receptor NCOA4 which is involved in the degradation of ferritin [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182921.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Consistently, inhibition of ferritinophagy by NCOA4 knockdown blocked the accumulation of cellular labile iron and ROS, as well as eventual blockage of ferroptotic cell death [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182921.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This suggests ferroptosis is an autophagic cell death process. Conversely, prolonged iron mediated ROS generation can induce autophagy in the absence of ferroptosis. Our results show that ferroptosis can occur independently of autophagy induced cell death. Indeed, inhibition of autophagy at early time points promotes cell death. This indicates ferroptosis and autophagy might cooperate to induce cell death but ferroptosis could be occurring independent of autophagy induced cell death.</p><p>Iron is a requisite metal in almost all biological systems. It is required for numerous critical processes such as DNA synthesis, heme and iron-sulfur cluster synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0182921.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It also plays an important role in the active sites of various enzymes such as cytochrome c, aconitase, and ribonucleotide reductase [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the levels of iron in the cell need to be tightly balanced, as an excess of iron can have damaging effects due to the generation of ROS [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Exogenous application of iron oxide nanoparticles to cells in culture can lead to induction of autophagy due to ROS generation [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Addition of reactive iron also leads to increased ROS and autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0182921.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our results shown that at 24 hours after treatment iron levels are increased corresponding to increased ROS and autosis. Thus, iron is required ferroptosis but iron mediated ROS could also lead to elevated and prolonged autophagy leading to autosis.</p><p>Taken together, our findings provide insight into the regulation of ferroptosis and autosis. This involves altering iron transport and iron storage in a time dependent manner leading to increased ROS and cell death in breast cancer cells. Using clinical agent for the treatment of breast cancer (lapatinib) in combination with a lysosomotropic agent such as siramesine, new therapeutic strategies to overcome apoptotic resistance in breast cancer could be developed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Trypan blue solution (Prod.
