Worldwide, cataracts are a major cause of treatable visual impairment in children, occurring in 1.2&#x02013;6 per 10,000 live births [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hereditary congenital cataracts account for 10&#x02013;25% of pediatric cataract cases [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In these cases, cataracts can occur in isolation or with other ocular and systemic abnormalities. Mutations in lens crystallins and gap junction proteins constitute one of the most common genetic alterations causing hereditary congenital cataract, but there is considerable genetic heterogeneity [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Ocular lenses are avascular structures that derive nutrients from the adjacent aqueous humor. Water and solutes enter the lens driven by pumps in the epithelium, move through extracellular spaces, and cross the cell membranes of lens fiber cells before being brought back to the surface through channels contained in gap junctions; this process allows for nutrient and metabolite exchange, maintenance of resting potentials, and lens clarity [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Gap junction proteins (i.e., connexins) oligomerize to form hexameric hemichannels that traffic to the plasma membrane. Two hemichannels from adjacent cells dock with each other to form a gap junction channel containing a central pore that allows for communication between the cells. Connexins share a similar membrane topology with four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, one cytoplasmic loop, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In human lenses, three different gap junction proteins have been identified; mutants of those found in mature lens fiber cells, connexin50 (Cx50) and connexin46 (Cx46) have been associated with congenital cataracts [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we identified a family with congenital cataracts associated with a variant of <italic>GJA8</italic> encoding a substitution in the fourth transmembrane domain of Cx50 (c.658A&#x0003e;G; p.N220D) and examined the biochemical and functional consequences of this variant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

After 5 min following microinjection of the tracers, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, subjected to immunofluorescence (using rabbit anti-Cx50 antibodies and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies), and incubated with Cy3-streptavidin conjugate to allow detection of the Neurobiotin by fluorescence microscopy. Lucifer yellow was used to identify the injected cell, because Cx50 shows limited permeability to this dye. Incidence of coupling was quantified in clusters of Cx50-immunopositive cells as the number of injections that resulted in Neurobiotin transfer divided by the number of injections.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec016"><title>Results</title><p>We identified a three-generation Caucasian family comprising three individuals with congenital cataracts and aphakic glaucoma inherited in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant transmission (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183438.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>). The proband (III-1) was born 5 weeks prematurely and had a 14-day stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. She was noted to have partial cataracts at 4 weeks of age, which became very dense nuclear and cortical cataracts by 6 weeks of age. She underwent uncomplicated bilateral lensectomy and anterior vitrectomy at 7.5 weeks of age. She was diagnosed with aphakic glaucoma at 3 months of age and was treated with a glaucoma drainage tube in the right eye and aqueous suppressant medications in the left eye. The proband&#x02019;s mother (II-2) was diagnosed with bilateral cataracts at a few months of age. She had bilateral cataract extraction at age 5 months and subsequently developed aphakic glaucoma in both eyes. The proband&#x02019;s maternal aunt (II-3) had bilateral congenital cataracts and microphthalmia. She developed aphakic glaucoma in both eyes following cataract extraction, requiring multiple surgical interventions.

This variant results in the substitution of a polar, uncharged asparagine at amino acid position 220 for a negatively charged aspartic acid (N220D). Asparagine at this position in Cx50 is highly conserved across species and across other connexin isoforms. The substitution is predicted to be probably damaging based on bioinformatic algorithms. However, based upon genetic evidence, the pathogenicity of this variant is equivocal. It was first identified in a subject from a family with congenital cataracts, but was also found in 1 out of 340 alleles in the control population (allelic frequency: 0.003), which led to the conclusion that was a non-pathogenic polymorphism [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The mutation was also found in a subject with congenital cataract and microcornea and in his unaffected father, but not in his affected sibling, indicating that it did not segregate with the disease in the family [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In our pedigree, the mutation was present in all affected subjects, but it was also found in the proband&#x02019;s maternal grandfather who was reported to be unaffected. These observations suggest that the mutation is either an incidental finding or that it is pathogenic with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. Environmental factors, stochastic events, epigenetic changes or differences in genetic background (or modifiers) can all contribute to differential effects of a mutation. Notably, in the family reported here all affected members are female, however, in a previous study the affected child and the unaffected father that carried the mutation were male [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Ours is the first study to characterize the consequences of the N220D variant on the biochemical and functional properties of Cx50. The most common pathogenic mechanism found in other cataract-associated Cx50 mutants is failure to form gap junctions due to impaired protein folding and/or localization to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Unlike most pathogenic mutations, Cx50<sup>N220D</sup> localized to appositional plasma membranes and formed functional gap junction plaques between adjacent cells. These results demonstrate that this variant does not abolish intercellular channel function (at least not in transfected HeLa cells). Variations of cell density within the same tissue culture dish and of protein expression in transient transfection experiments preclude us from estimating whether the extent of transfer differs between Cx50 and Cx50<sup>N220D</sup>. The ability of Cx50<sup>N220D</sup> to support intercellular communication may explain the lack of segregation of the variant with the cataract phenotype in the different families. The results suggest that other factors might contribute to the pathology.</p><p>Although Cx50<sup>N220D</sup> is the only variant in the fourth transmembrane domain of Cx50 identified to date, mutations in the corresponding region of other connexins have been associated with diseases, including autosomal dominant congenital cataract (Cx46<sup>F206I</sup>) and autosomal dominant and recessive hearing loss (Cx26<sup>C202F</sup> and Cx26<sup>N206S</sup>, respectively). Interestingly, the N220D substitution in Cx50 occurs in a homologous position to N206S in Cx26, however, the functional consequences appear to be different. This might relate to the differential permeability of the intercellular channels formed by Cx50 and Cx26. Cx50 channels are permeable to Neurobiotin, but show limited intercellular transfer of Lucifer yellow whereas Cx26 channels are permeable to both cationic and anionic molecules with a cationic preference. This implies that the amino acid residues determining permeation must differ between Cx26 and Cx50 [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. N206 is involved in critical interactions within the Cx26 channel; the crystal structure of Cx26 shows that N206 forms a hydrogen bond with R143, located on the third transmembrane domain [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Mutations in this residue are predicted to disrupt this interaction; indeed, Cx26<sup>N206S</sup> gap junction channels show altered voltage gating properties and decreased permeability to ethidium (charge +1, MW: 314.39), but preserve permeability to anionic Lucifer yellow [<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183438.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In Cx50 <sup>N220D</sup>, however, we did not find a difference in intracellular transfer of Neurobiotin compared to wild-type Cx50.</p><p>In summary, we identified and characterized a variant occuring in transmembrane domain 4 of Cx50 in a family with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts. Functional studies demonstrated that Cx50<sup>N220D</sup> forms gap junctions that allow the passage of small, cationic molecules, similar to wild-type Cx50, supporting that this is a rare, benign variant rather than the causative mutation in this family.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the family members for their participation and Dr. Cassandra Labelle-Dumais for input and technical support.
