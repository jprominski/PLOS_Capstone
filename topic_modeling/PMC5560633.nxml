We discuss herein the fundamental problems in breeding for disease resistance with the aim being to better understand the interactions between plant, pathogen, and spatial patterns. The goal of this study is to fine tune breeding decisions by incorporating spatial patterns of such biotic factors into the definition of disease-occurrence probability. We use a preexisting statistics method based on geostatistics for a descriptive analysis of biotic factors for trial quality control. The plant-population structure used for spatial-pattern analysis consists of two F1-hybrid cultivars, defined as symptomatic and asymptomatic controls with respect to the studied pathogen. The controls are inserted at specific locations to establish a grid arrangement over the field that include the F1-hybrid cultivars under evaluation. We characterize the spatial structure of the pathogen population and of the general plant environment&#x02014;with undetermined but present abiotic constraints&#x02014;not by using direct notation such as flower time or rainfall but by using plant behavior (i.e., leaf symptom severity, indirect notation). The analysis indicates areas with higher or lower risk of disease and reveals a correlation between the symptomatic control and the effective level of disease for sunflowers. This result suggests that the pathogen and/or abiotic components are major factors in determining the probability that a plant develops the disease, which could lead to a misinterpretation of plant resistance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>CIFRE</institution></funding-source><award-id>2013/1431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Missonnier</surname><given-names>H&#x000e9;l&#x000e8;ne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Project was supported by French Ministry of Higher Education and Research: CIFRE 2013/1431, ANRT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/espace_cifre/accueil.jsp">http://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/espace_cifre/accueil.jsp</ext-link>.

The accurate selection of desirable genotypes based on phenotype observations can be restricted by environmentally dependent trait expression, which causes non-heritable variations and prevents plants from expressing their full genetic potential [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, improving crop productivity partially means improving tolerance or resistance to these environmental stresses [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Stresses caused by environmental factors could be related to suboptimal climatic and/or edaphic conditions that impair growth and fitness; these are referred to as abiotic stresses [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several examples of breeding for abiotic-stress tolerance may be found and concern mainly drought and salinity, which are the primary causes of crop loss worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, environmental stresses could be biotic factors, including pathogen pressures, which play an important role in limiting yield. In sunflower (<italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> L.<italic>)</italic> production, fungal pathogens (including oomycetes) bear a critical responsibility in large yield losses and indeed are fully integrated in breeding programs, with the case of phomopsis stem canker or downy mildew being prime examples [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Leaf senescence is a crop stage of interest when a crop development is observed. Leaf senescence, plant response that is basically governed by the developmental age is also influenced by various internal and environmental signals that are finally integrated into the age information. Among these environmental factors, including the main abiotic stress of sunflower (heating stress, drought, and nutrient deficiency), pathogen infection is one of them and Verticillium, a &#x0201c;turgor reducer&#x0201d; increase senescence process [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Strategies to breed for disease resistance may be (i) pragmatic breeding (direct selection), (ii) marker-assisted breeding and genomic selection or, more recently, (iii) effector-assisted breeding; all are combined with selection based on phenotypic information [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Host genes involved in resistance and tolerance to environmental factors are still a famous strategies for environmental stress management. In sunflower, several genes have been found to directly or indirectly be involved in various interaction leading to resistance. Sunflower leaf senescence is actively studied as well as sunflower resistance to downy mildew [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Environmental variance results in plants or experimental plots varying even when they are genetically uniform and have received the same treatment [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Abiotic stress can reduce or enhance susceptibility to a biotic pest or pathogen and vice versa. Among the most interactive abiotic stresses that contribute to plant-disease development are high temperature and humidity, which affect pathogen growth and modify disease resistance in plants [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Recording plant-disease phenotypes involves, in addition to recording the biotic parameters of the studied pathogen, recording both the environmental stresses that increase plant predisposition to the given disease and the environmental stresses that directly interact with the pathogen. It can indeed modulate symptom expression of the disease and thus affect host-pathogen interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181050.g001">Fig 1</xref>, in red). Deciding how to breed plants for disease resistance requires knowledge of the type and magnitude of all environmental variations that limit disease expression; the specific interaction narrows the link between pathogen and plant genetics, as indicated schematically by the black zone in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181050.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone.0181050.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0181050.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Representation of the complex relation leading to disease.</title><p>The plant evolves in an environment (in gray) described by abiotic and biotic parameters (light gray and dark gray, respectively). The disease phenotype in the field is the result of the interaction of a plant with a pathogen in a specific environment (in red). The pathogen first evolves in a microbiome, in interaction with other microbes that can promote or decrease the virulence. The abiotic conditions interact with plant growth and plant defenses but also with pathogen virulence. In breeding (Br), the plant disease resistance results from the interaction between the plant genetics and the specific pathogen. To be generalizable, the other biotic and abiotic conditions, even if integrated when the resistance gene is discovered, should interact to a lesser extent in the discovery of the resistance gene.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0181050.g001"/></fig><p>The case of soilborne pathogens is interesting because they directly interact with the environmental factors of the rhizosphere and are also indirectly affected by the phyllosphere through changes in plant metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The spatial organization of host and pathogen populations may be critical in determining patterns of disease occurrence and dynamics. Disease phenotyping is done either through field-plot research in naturally infested fields with a disease history or by artificial inoculation [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One problem related to the screening for resistance against the soilborne fungi is the distribution of the pathogen, which is not always uniform across the fields. Two phenomena explain this non-random distribution: (i) soilborne pathogens tend to occupy a patchy distribution that results mainly from the primary inoculum survival pattern [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and/or (ii) soilborne pathogens have limited dispersal capabilities [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Lower pathogen pressure at particular locations in a field may lead to misinterpretations of the presumed plant response [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>A large collection of spatial statistical techniques exist for integrating the effects of environmental variation or to explore the structure of plant-pathogen interactions. A classical approach to minimizing field heterogeneity is to design the experiment to account for the existing variability [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Plants are often arranged either homogeneously or in a regular grid lattice and are confined to the place where they grow. Under such configurations, the pathogen distribution can be analyzed by simply plotting in absolute coordinates the spatial pattern of the disease status of sample plants. A classic way to deal with local spatial variation is the use of control plots. Symptomatic genotypes considered as controls can reveal the presence or absence of favorable conditions (both environmental and pathogenic parameters) for the disease [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This approach, although incomplete, provides good support for investigating the heterogeneity of pathogen pressure in natural systems.</p><p>Geostatistics were first introduced in the mining industry before spreading to many different fields, such as geology, meteorology, soil sciences, agronomy, and precision agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This tool accounts for correlations between data that are not considered by the more common statistical tools (which generally assume that each datum is independent of all others). Geostatistics models spatial dependence by identifying the structural variability via a semivariogram. It provides an optimal prediction of unrecorded data through kriging methods by using observations at nearby locations [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Many examples of applications in ecology have been reported, which demonstrates the interest in this tool for studying environment-dependent variables [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In plant pathology, spatial tools are commonly applied [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and this is especially the case for diseases caused by soilborne fungi. Such an approach focuses on the primary inoculum-distribution patterns. Several examples involving soilborne fungi pathosystems are available, such as bait plant- <italic>Rhizoctonia</italic>. <italic>solani</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Lettuce- <italic>Sclerotinia</italic> minor [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], tobacco transplant- <italic>Phytophtora</italic>. <italic>parasitica var</italic>. <italic>nicotianae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and wheat-fusarium head blight [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

To document the spatial interactions in breeding for disease resistance, we introduce application of geostatistics technique on novel experimental design.

Disease caused by soilborne fungi depends largely on the spatial pattern of the primary inoculum, and the primary-inoculum distribution depends strongly on crop practices [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Artificial inoculation remains the best option for screening soilborne disease [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. When not applicable on large scales or when the pathogen has to be studied in a native system, the proposed methodology integrates both pathogen and disease components in the breeding evaluation. An original method to phenotype disease caused by soilborne fungi was developed and consists of the systematic integration of control plots within the field at fixed locations to cover the evaluation area. A different randomization was applied to simultaneously evaluate the symptoms of genotypes as a function of pathogen constraints and within-field variability. The proposed experimental design provides a first insight into disease-expression variability [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This method also provides temporal information on the spread of disease (i) over the short term with the implementation of two different phenological stages; and (ii) over the long term because fields are reused every other year (due to farming practices and rotation). The disease pattern can thus be fully described both temporally and spatially.</p><p>Spatial-analysis indices were largely applied on primary distribution inoculum, which led to strong results and unambiguous interpretation [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A spatial analysis of the disease severity remains difficult because it encompasses the probability of the infection to occur and the probability of a plant to develop the disease [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The index of aggregation confirms that field heterogeneity may be estimated with the experimental design used in this study. The best method to visualize field variability and disease pattern in this study is through geostatistics that describe the entire area being evaluated. Semivariograms confirm the spatial dependence of the disease (i.e., disease level depends on plot location).</p><p>The introduction of symptomatic control within the field provides a first view of a disease pattern [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0181050.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. According to S-control results, variations in the expression of Verticillium wilt symptoms appeared in the fields investigated. The infection of each experimental plot was expressed in terms of degree of infection of its associated interpolated S-control score. This criterion provided additional information on the environmental effects that included the pathogen parameters. The coefficient of correlation for 2013 between the S-interpolated score and the evaluation of F1-hybrid cultivars (0.32) confirms that the disease evaluation must be interpreted carefully. The difference in disease expression between the S-interpolated score and the under-evaluation genotypes is likely due to genetic variation in the plants. The ability to differentiate disease variation caused by plant genetics and pathogen parameters represents an opportunity to both improve breeding for resistance and obtain knowledge on the pathogen. Results from this two-year study allow us to analyze disease variability at the field level and reveal that microenvironment parameters likely play an important role in disease expression.</p><p>One aspect of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> remaining to discover is to what extent its genetic makeup is uniform over the field, or whether various pathogen strains are present simultaneously, each with their own patchy distribution [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Due to the diversity among different strains of the same pathogen and the differential range of selection pressure, the pathogen-population genetics should be integrated into the disease-management strategy to fully exploit the potential of resistance sources [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This is particularly relevant for the present study because species in the <italic>Verticillium</italic> genus are considered asexual, which leads to the question how <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> can be competitive in the arms race with its hosts [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. <italic>V</italic>. <italic>dahliae</italic> has been shown to be an unusual pathogen in terms of evolution and adaptability, and different strains that carry differing effector catalogs may co-occur [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The proposed method, which focuses on symptom expression at two different plant stages, indirectly accounts for the fungal population (the means of individuals at various stages of their life cycle). The experimental design that enables the visualization of the evolution of symptoms related to the pathogen in question provides valuable information regarding the design of plot sampling in subsequent pathogen field diversity studies.</p><p>The impact of pathogen-pathogen associations on disease expression has been considered for a long time and is important for soilborne diseases [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The disease-phenotype concept illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181050.g001">Fig 1</xref> is represented in a hierarchical phenomenon where pathogens often do not act independently and infection is related to the presence or absence of other microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The non-disease-specific method can be applied simultaneously on different pathosystems. The next step is to include several genotypes with different susceptibility levels to several pathogens. Indeed, the simultaneous implementation of appropriate controls makes it possible to extend the developed methodology to multiple diseases. Co-geostatistics analyses can then be applied and tend to crop-disease-complex modeling, which add an additional parameter in the disease equation&#x02014;another host pathogenic microorganism. With this method the pathogen-pathogen effects can be considered in the phenotype most related to the host-pathogenic microorganism. In a similar way, the disease-phenotype concept is represented in a hierarchical phenomenon where infection, which can be driven by abiotic stresses, is also related to environmental conditions. Regarding the current work on the sunflower model and epidemiological model coupling (SUNFLO_Maladies), the method developed in this work could provide additional information to implement in the model [<xref rid="pone.0181050.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The next step is the simultaneous implementation of crop notation in conjunction with specific abiotic stress and the measurement of environmental heterogeneity (e.g., soil structure in the case of soilborne pathogens, or temperature and relative humidity) to obtain information on the specific pressure of a pathogen or on pressures due to several pathogens.</p><p>The proposed method is not expected to capture all factors of a complex spatial pattern in the evolving environment of a pathogen, but it adds a practical tool that, in combination with other statistical and biological approaches, should advance research in this field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181050.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>R Script for model fitting.</title><p>Each line represents a code to apply on the dataset.</p><p>(TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181050.s001.txt"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181050.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>R script for spatial analysis.</title><p>Each line represents a code to apply on the dataset.</p><p>(TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181050.s002.txt"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181050.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Example of a dataset: 2013 Symptomatic control database.</title><p>The dataset contains the geographic coordinates of control plot and the disease notation of each plot that will be extrapolated using the Kriging method.</p><p>(TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181050.s003.txt"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0181050.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Field grid for 2013 dataset analysis.</title><p>The dataset contains the geographic coordinates for each field plots to draw the field for further extrapolation.</p><p>(GRID)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0181050.s004.Grid"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Project was supported by French Ministry of Higher Education and Research: CIFRE 2013/1431, ANRT, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/espace_cifre/accueil.jsp">http://www.anrt.asso.fr/fr/espace_cifre/accueil.jsp</ext-link></p><p>Syngenta provided support in the form of salaries for authors [HM, JB, VMT], but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0181050.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Fairfield</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>A discriminant function for plant selection</article-title>. <source>Annals of Human Genetics</source>. <year>1936</year>;<volume>7</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>240</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>50</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0181050.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Boyer</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Plant productivity and environment</article-title>. <source>Science</source>. <year>1982</year>;<volume>218</volume>(<issue>4571</issue>):<fpage>443</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>8</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.218.4571.443">10.1126/science.218.4571.443</ext-link></comment>
