LPAP is a component of a supramolecular complex composed of the phosphatase CD45, the co-receptor CD4, and the kinase Lck. In contrast to its immunologically important partners, the function of LPAP is unknown. We hypothesized that the biological role of LPAP may be determined by analyzing LPAP phosphorylation. In the present study, we identified LPAP phosphorylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis, phospho-specific antibodies, and protein immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry analysis. Our results confirmed previous reports that Ser-99, Ser-153, and Ser-163 are phosphorylated, as well as provided evidence for the phosphorylation of Ser-172. Using various SDS-PAGE techniques, we detected and quantified a set of LPAP phosphoforms that were assigned to a combination of particular phosphorylation events. The phosphorylation of LPAP appears to be a tightly regulated process. Our results support the model: following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or TCR/CD3 activation of T cells, LPAP is rapidly dephosphorylated at Ser-99 and Ser-172 and slowly phosphorylated at Ser-163. Ser-153 exhibited a high basal level of phosphorylation in both resting and activated cells. Therefore, we suggest that LPAP may function as a co-regulator of T-cell signaling.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002261</institution-id><institution>Russian Foundation for Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-04-00526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6460-9427</contrib-id><name><surname>Filatov</surname><given-names>Alexander V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project 14-15-00702) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rscf.ru/prjcard?rid=14-15-00702">http://www.rscf.ru/prjcard?rid=14-15-00702</ext-link>) and a grant from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research No. 17-04-00526.

LPAP is located predominantly on the plasma membrane as part of a supramolecular complex and is tightly bound to the phosphatase CD45 via its transmembrane domain [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Two segments of LPAP are identified as putative binding domains, including a WW domain [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and an acidic domain required for interaction with the kinase Lck [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Another component of the supramolecular complex is the co-receptor CD4 [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although LPAP is located at the cell membrane in proximity to several immunologically important molecules, its function remains unclear.</p><p>It was assumed that LPAP may serve as a substrate for CD45 [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or, alternatively, may regulate CD45 activity [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These hypotheses initially ignited interest in LPAP, but this interest dissipated upon generation of <italic>PTPRCAP</italic> knock-out (KO) mice and the associated uncertain and contradictory results. The absence of <italic>PTPRCAP</italic> may have an effect on antigen-specific signaling [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], whereas other results found that <italic>PTPRCAP</italic> was dispensable for signaling [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since these results were reported, new data related to LPAP have appeared only sporadically and in the context of large-scale transcriptomic [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and proteomic studies [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; very little LPAP-specific work has been conducted.</p><p>Because LPAP is a phosphoprotein with its phosphorylation status dependent upon cell activation, we hypothesize that analyzing LPAP phosphorylation may provide insight into its function. There are several identified LPAP phosphorylation sites [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but these data were gleaned from bulk large-scale proteomic studies, and, unfortunately, do not specify stoichiometry or functional significance of particular phosphosites. A new set of anti-LPAP monoclonal antibodies, generated in our laboratory [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and tested on the 10<sup>th</sup> human leukocyte differentiation antigen (HLDA) [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], provide an additional instrument for LPAP investigation. Using these antibodies, we identified at least five different LPAP phosphoforms in lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Detection of protein phosphorylation is widely used to monitor signal transduction during cell activation. For instance, T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation of Jurkat cells leads to changes in the phosphorylation status of nearly 700 unique sites associated with signaling, cytoskeleton polarization, alternative splicing, and other processes [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. LPAP was identified as one such protein that phosphorylation status was dependent on cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the activator of protein kinase C (PKC) and Ras pathways, also alters LPAP phosphorylation [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Through determination of LPAP phosphorylation sites and the conditions under which their phosphorylation occurs, as well as identification of the kinases and phosphatases involved, the biological function of this protein can be understood. Here, we conducted a small-scale study focused on LPAP posttranslational modifications. We experimentally confirmed the sites of previously reported LPAP phosphorylation and identified a new site of phosphorylation. We assigned diverse combinations of phospho variants to particular LPAP proteoforms and determined their stoichiometry. Finally, we found that the phosphorylation status of LPAP changes dynamically upon cell activation with PMA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of NRC Institute of Immunology, Russia.

Cell debris was pelleted at 20,000 g for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Cell lysates were cleared overnight at 4&#x000b0;C by rotation with normal mouse IgG covalently linked to CNBr-Sepharose. Precipitations of precleared lysates with specific mAbs were carried out by using 30 &#x003bc;L 25% AffiGel Hz hydrazide agarose beads (Bio-Rad) coupled to anti-LPAP CL7 or CL3 mAb. Samples were precipitated under rotation at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h. Then, the beads were washed four times in the lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted by heating the beads in the SDS sample buffer at 80&#x000b0;C for 5 min or in isoelectric focusing sample buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% Triton X-100, 2% ampholytes, pH 3&#x02013;10, and 100 mM DTT at 28&#x000b0;C for 2 h.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Dephosphorylation</title><p>LPAP immune-purified with AffiGel-CL7 beads was transferred into the buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM DTT.

The position of the band containing unlabeled LPAP on the gel was identified by a parallel running of Cy3-labeled LPAP. Bands were manually excised and fixed in acetic acid. To remove SDS gel pieces were washed twice in 40% methanol with 10% glacial acetic acid and rinsed three times in deionized water. For trypsin digestion gel fragments were equilibrated with 50 mM triethyammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0). Trypsin (Promega) was added in a ratio of 1/50 (w/w) and samples were incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 5 h.

The instrument was operated in the positive ionization mode. The capillary voltage was set at -2.1 kV, and the ion transfer tube temperature was 260&#x000b0;C. The electrodynamic ion funnel voltage (s-lens RF level) was adjusted to 75%. In the data-dependent analysis (ddMS2) the precursor ions were surveyed in a range of 420&#x02013;1200 m/z at a resolution of R = 60K using quadrupole mass analyzer and Orbitrap detector type. The acquisition gain control (AGC) target was set to 4e5 ion, or maximum integration time of 85 ms. Dynamic exclusion after 3 consequent scans within 20 s (independent on single charge state per precursor) for 45 s and active apex triggered detection were applied during analysis. The precursor ions were selected for MS/MS using top-speed mode. The high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) was used as an activation type.

To address this issue, freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were labeled with Cy3/Cy5, lysed, and LPAP was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE or difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, LPAP from CEM cells, a T-lymphoblastoid cell line, and from PBMCs, migrated on 18% 1D-SDS-PAGE as two bands with apparent molecular masses of 28 and 32 kDa. Treatment of LPAP with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) resulted in disappearance of the lower band and an increase in the intensity of the upper band, indicating that the lower band corresponded to the phosphorylated protein. When resolved by 2D-SDS-PAGE, every band of LPAP split into at least three spots designated as U0, U1, and U2 for the upper train and L1, L2, and L3 for the lower train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Phosphatase treatment collapsed the spots into one, overlaid with the most alkaline spot from the upper train in the untreated sample, suggesting that the spot designated as U0 represented unphosphorylated LPAP, while U1 and U2 were mono- and di-phosphorylated forms. Phosphorylation of an unknown residue resulted in the downward shift in electrophoretic mobility of LPAP and the formation of the lower train. Some high MW spots on 2D gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) observed in fluorescent images were unspecific, because we could not detect them in Western blotting using anti-LPAP mAb.</p><fig id="pone.0182468.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182468.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of LPAP phosphoforms from PBMCs and CEM cells.</title><p>(A) LPAP immunoprecipitated from TX-100 lysates of PBMCs or CEM cells was dephosphorylated by CIP (+) or left untreated (-).

These results also indicate that Ser-153, but not Thr-155, is phosphorylated. Thus, the site-directed mutagenesis enabled us to conclude that Ser-99, Ser-153, and Ser-172 were the phosphorylation sites of LPAP.</p><p>Based upon our results, we assigned spots and bands to particular phosphoforms. The U0 spot on 2D-PAGE corresponds to unphosphorylated LPAP, U1 is a mono-phosphorylated form at either Ser-99 or Ser-153, and U2 represents a di-phosphorylated protein at both Ser-99 and Ser-153. All spots from the lower train were phosphorylated at Ser-172 and shifted into the acidic part of the gel. The L1 spot, which was very faint, represents the Ser-172 mono-phosphorylated form. The more intense spot, L2, corresponds to the mixture of di-phosphorylated forms pSer-99/pSer-172 with pSer-153/pSer-172. Finally, the most acidic spot, L3, comprises tri-phosphorylated LPAP pSer-99/pSer-153/pSer-172.</p><p>Unfortunately, 2D-PAGE has some limitations regarding the resolution of phosphoforms with the same number of phosphates. In order to overcome this obstacle, we used phosphate-affinity SDS-PAGE based on the interaction of phosphates with the Phos-tag molecules, which are co-polymerized in a gel and retard the mobility of phosphoproteins [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As different sites may have distinct surface exposure, and thus different binding to the Phos-tag reagent, proteoforms with the same number of phosphogroups can be separated. Using phosphate-affinity PAGE, we revealed phosphoforms that were impossible to detect by conventional 2D-PAGE. LPAP from wild-type CEM cells migrated on Phos-tag-PAGE as four major bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, lane 2), P1, P2, P3, and P4, according to their relative mobility from fast to slow. In the phosphatase-treated sample, P2, P3, and P4 collapsed into the P0 band that was shifted slightly downwards relative to P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, lane 1). The S172A mutant did not have bands P3 and P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, lane 7), whereas the S99A mutant lacked P4, but the P2 band was present with reduced intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, lane 3). The S153A mutant had P0 instead of P1. Therefore, we assumed that phosphorylation at Ser-153 leads to the smallest mobility shift in Phos-tag-PAGE, and P1 corresponds to the mono-phosphorylated form at Ser-153. Ser-99 phosphorylation leads to a moderate mobility shift resulting in formation of P2, including mono-phosphorylated pSer-99 as well as di-phosphorylated pSer-99/pSer-153. Following this logic, Ser-172 phosphorylation produces the greatest shift and gives rise to P3, which contains mono-phosphorylated pSer-172 and di-phosphorylated pS172/pSer-153. Finally, the highest band, P4, represents the tri-phosphorylated form at Ser-99, Ser-153, and Ser-172.</p><p>The intensity ratio of the bands P2, P3, and P4 may be used to assess the stoichiometry of the phosphoforms bearing pSer-99, pSer-172, and pSer-99/pSer-172 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The intensity of the first band represents the quantity of the unphosphorylated and pS153 mono-phosphorylated forms. Taking into account our previous results [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], demonstrating that the level of unphosphorylated LPAP was approximately 15%, we calculated the proportion of the pS153 mono-phosphorylated form to be approximately 40%.</p><p>Thus, our results obtained by two different electrophoretic methods are in agreement.

Cell stimulation with PMA, a PKC activator, changes the phosphorylation status of LPAP [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, we observed a significantly altered pattern of LPAP phosphorylation after PMA treatment of CEM cells. The most prominent modification was the disappearance of the entire lower train on 2D-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) as well as of the lower band on 1D-SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, upper panel). At the same time, the upper train was reduced to two spots, mono-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated. The kinetics of LPAP dephosphorylation was relatively quick, such that 5 min following PMA addition, the lower 29 kDa band disappeared on 18% 1D-PAGE, indicating that Ser-172 was dephosphorylated. In order to obtain more detailed information regarding the kinetics of LPAP phosphorylation, we performed Phos-tag-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, lower panel) and found that at 5 min of stimulation, the two upper bands, ascribed to Ser-172 phosphorylation, disappeared. Concurrently, the intensity of the band containing pSer-99 substantially decreased, and a new band appeared and increased in intensity until 20 min, after which it was maintained at the same level up to the end of the experiment. This new band migrated more slowly than the band with pSer-153 and was abrogated by phosphatase treatment. Thus, PMA stimulation led to phosphorylation of a new site on the LPAP molecule, and to identify this site, we tested additional mutants; however, the only mutation that abolished the PMA-triggered phosphoform was Ser-163A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Noticeably, PMA activation resulted in a subtle downward shift of the mono-phosphorylated phosphoform on 2D-PAGE, which may be indicative of Ser-163 phosphorylation. Based upon these data, we conclude that after PMA stimulation, LPAP undergoes complete dephosphorylation at Ser-172, partial dephosphorylation at Ser-99, and phosphorylation at Ser-163. In contrast to PMA-dependent sites, the level of LPAP phosphorylation at Ser-153 remains very high in both resting and activated cells.</p><fig id="pone.0182468.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182468.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>LPAP phosphorylation in activated CEM and Jurkat cells.</title><p>(A) CEM cells were activated with PMA (10 ng/ml) for 30 min, lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-LPAP antibody.

In spite of its small size, LPAP is a challenging protein to analyze for posttranslational modifications by MS. LPAP has no Lys residues and can be cut only at rare Arg residues, resulting in relatively large peptides, particularly in the area of interest. The phosphorylation site Ser-99 was easily identified because it was located on a MS-friendly tryptic peptide 95-AELGpSTDNDLER-106 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182468.t001">Table 1</xref>). However, the majority of the predicted phosphorylation sites are found on two very large tryptic fragments with molecular masses of 4287 and 4145 Da. The most poorly detected peptide was that with pS153 due to its sizable length and slow chromatographic mobility. This peptide was eluted in a far hydrophobic segment of the applied gradient. The reasonable signal of this peptide, with high accuracy suitable for the purpose of spectrum match sequencing, was obtained for an ion with a z = 4+ charge state. We did not observe any other modifications on the tryptic peptides and used pepsin digestion under strong acidic conditions in subsequent experiments. In this case, the peptide (aa 160&#x02013;177) was the most interesting, because it was expected to bear a new phosphorylation site. Modification of the S172 residue was confirmed by a ladder of b-type fragment ions carrying neutral losses of 98 Da, which is a feature of a phospho-moiety. The y-type ions were poorly represented, because non-tryptic peptides are poorly ionized.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0182468.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0182468.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Identification of LPAP phosphorylation sites by tandem mass spectrometry.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0182468.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0182468.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Digestion</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phosphosite</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Charge (z)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Observed m/z</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Calculated m/z</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Accuracy (ppm)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Retention time (min)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X corrected (for peptide)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95-AELG<underline><bold>pS</bold></underline>TDNDLER-106</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">trypsin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ser-99</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2+</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">700.2901</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">700.2905</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">-0.60</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.43</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.37</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">147-AEEARD<underline><bold>pS</bold></underline>DTEGDLVLGSPGPASAGGSAEALLSDLHAFAGSAAWDDSAR-194</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">trypsin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ser-153</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4+</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1195.7877</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1195.7878</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">+0.22</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.79</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.43</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160- VLGSPGPASAGG<underline><bold>pS</bold></underline>AEALL-177</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pepsin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ser-172</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2+</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">817.3951</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">817.3953</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">-0.13</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.29</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.17</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">160-VLG<underline><bold>pS</bold></underline>PGPASAGGSAEAL-176</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">pepsin</td><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Ser-163</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2+</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">760.8533</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">760.8538</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">+0.65</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="2" colspan="1">37.05</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3+</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">507.5713</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">507.5716</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">+0.59</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.71</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>In order to identify sites phosphorylated upon cell stimulation, we used samples of LPAP immuno-purified from PMA-stimulated CEM cells.

There were two Ser residues within the peptide, but this ambiguity was resolved by rigorous investigation of fragmentation spectra. The location of the phosphogroup at S163 was elucidated by a series of b-ions starting from the b4 fragment, because some (such as b4, b5, b7, b9, b11) carried the phosphogroup, as well as ions with neutral losses of a water molecule and a phosphomoiety. However, because pS163 was located close to the N-termini, the vast majority of y-series ions were detected intact and only a small portion (y14, y15, and y16) could be fixed as phosphogroup carriers.

(B) In resting normal lymphocytes LPAP is present as a mixture of mono-, di-, and three-phosphorylated proteoforms with phosphogroups located at Ser-99, Ser-153, and Ser-172. Soon after PMA activation pSer-99 and pSer-172 are dephosphorylated by an unknown phosphatase. However, by 20 min of activation Ser-163 is phosphorylated presumably by ERK/CDK kinases. P, phosphorylation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0182468.g009"/></fig><p>The cytoplasmic tail of LPAP contains three tyrosine residues, two of which, Tyr-64 and Tyr-115, are predicted to be phosphorylated with a high score by NetPhos. Tyr-115 is part of a consensus sequence, YxxV/L/I, for phosphorylation by Src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and a small portion of Tyr is indeed phosphorylated [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Nevertheless, we failed to detect any phosphorylation at Tyr-115 by site-directed mutagenesis, anti-pTyr Ab staining, or MS analysis.</p><p>In contrast to protein kinases, Ser-Thr phosphatases from the most abundant group of PPP phosphatases do not have well-defined motifs and the prediction of their potential substrates is not straight-forward [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. There are several degenerate motifs for Ser-Thr phosphatases reported in the literature (in comparison to more than a hundred of motifs for kinases), but none of them is found in LPAP [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, the nature of LPAP phosphatases is still under question.</p><p>Conventionally, proteomic data concerns individual phosphorylation sites and does not reflect the presence of site combinations, but this information can be deduced from analysis of particular phosphoforms. Using 2D-PAGE and Phos-tag-PAGE, we resolved and quantitatively characterized at least six LPAP phosphoforms, providing the first quantitative measurement of LPAP phosphorylation at individual sites. Furthermore, we found that Ser-153 was phosphorylated in most LPAP molecules, whereas in resting CEM cells, Ser-99 and Ser-172 were phosphorylated in 35% and 15% of LPAP molecules, respectively.</p><p>It is important to determine whether LPAP phosphorylation characterized for CEM cells is valid for primary lymphocytes. We found that patterns of LPAP phosphorylation detected by SDS-PAGE in PBMCs resembled those in CEM cells. Therefore, we considered the phosphorylation sites identified in LPAP from CEM cells appropriate for LPAP from PBMCs. However, there is some uncertainty about phosphorylation of Ser-172 in lymphocytes. Thus, we could not detect a downward shifted band at 28 kDa in purified CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets. In line with this phospho-specific anti-p172 Abs gave poor reaction with LPAP from PBMC, possibly due to low stoichiometry of pSer-172 in these cells.</p><p>In order to understand how proximal or distal LPAP phosphorylation takes place in a signaling pathway, we compared the kinetics of LPAP phosphorylation changes after PMA stimulation with the time courses of other PMA-induced processes. PMA is a direct PKC activator that promotes rapid (&#x0003c;5 min) redistribution of PKC from the cytosolic to the membrane compartment [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. PMA stimulation also leads to activation of the Ras signaling pathway. The PMA-triggered phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK occurs by 2 min, and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and p90Rsk increases more slowly and peaks by 15&#x02013;30 min [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Eventually, PMA activates the transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-kB, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and others. However, this is a delayed process that requires several hours [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Compared to the processes described above, the dynamic of pSer-99 and pSer-172 dephosphorylation is rapid (&#x0003c;5 min), and therefore, related to early events associated with PMA-induced cell stimulation. This supports the idea that LPAP dephosphorylation at pSer-172 is proximal to PMA stimulation and is not the effect of secondary processes. Similarly, Mayya et al. [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] demonstrated that Ser-99 is dephosphorylated after activation of lymphocytes through the TCR. In contrast, the phosphorylation kinetics of Ser-163 were significantly delayed, suggesting that they are mediated by a kinase working at the late signaling steps, presumably by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a proline-directed kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that the phosphorylation of LPAP is involved in signal transduction in lymphocytes for the following reasons. First, LPAP is localized to the cell membrane. Second, LPAP is tightly associated with the following molecules involved in the regulation of lymphocyte signaling: protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], co-receptor CD4 [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and kinase Lck [<xref rid="pone.0182468.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Third, the kinetics of LPAP phosphorylation are consistent with those observed for other major signaling molecules. Taken together, these data make it possible to hypothesize that LPAP plays a role in cell signaling.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrated that LPAP in lymphocytes exists in several phosphoforms, which we detected through site-directed mutagenesis, phospho-specific antibodies, and MS analysis. We have shown that phospho-modification of LPAP is altered dynamically and site-specifically upon cell stimulation with the PKC activator, PMA. We believe that the changes in the phosphorylation status of LPAP are important for TCR activation and signal transduction in primary human lymphocytes, and its comprehensive analysis may ultimately uncover a true function of this small enigmatic molecule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182468.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Supplementary images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182468.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182468.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Supplementary images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g003">Fig 3</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182468.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182468.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Supplementary images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g004">Fig 4</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182468.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182468.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Supplementary images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g005">Fig 5</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182468.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182468.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Supplementary images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g006">Fig 6</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182468.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182468.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Supplementary images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g007">Fig 7</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182468.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0182468.s007"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>Supplementary images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182468.g008">Fig 8</xref>.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0182468.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0182468.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Schraven</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kirchgessner</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gaber</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Samstag</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Meuer</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>A functional complex is formed in human T lymphocytes between the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45, the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck and pp32, a possible common substrate</article-title>. <source>Eur J Immunol</source>. <year>1991</year>;<volume>21</volume>: <fpage>2469</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>2477</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.1830211025">10.1002/eji.1830211025</ext-link></comment>
