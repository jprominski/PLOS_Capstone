In addition, Na,K-ATPase also acts as a signal-transducing receptor for cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain and activates a number of signalling pathways. Several studies report that ouabain affects cell migration. Here we used ouabain at concentrations far below those required to block Na,K-ATPase pump activity and show that it significantly reduced RPE cell migration through two mechanisms. It causes dephosphorylation of a 130 kD protein, which we identify as p130cas. Src is involved, because Src inhibitors, but not inhibitors of other kinases tested, caused a similar reduction in p130cas phosphorylation and ouabain increased the association of Na,K-ATPase and Src. Knockdown of p130cas by siRNA reduced cell migration. Unexpectedly, ouabain induced separation of nucleus and centrosome, also leading to a block in cell migration. Inhibitor and siRNA experiments show that this effect is mediated by ERK1,2. This is the first report showing that ouabain can regulate cell migration by affecting nucleus-centrosome association.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 111008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3542-1257</contrib-id><name><surname>van der Hoorn</surname><given-names>Frans A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>national science and engineering research council</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3542-1257</contrib-id><name><surname>van der Hoorn</surname><given-names>Frans A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 111008 to FVDH): (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/">http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/</ext-link>) and the National Science and Engineering Research Council (Discovery Grant to FVDH): (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp</ext-link>).

During each functional cycle, it pumps three sodium ions out and transports two potassium ions into the cell for each hydrolyzed molecule of ATP. The enzyme consists of two nonconvalently linked subunits: the &#x003b1;-subunit contains the ATP catalytic domain and the &#x003b2;-subunit may facilitate the insertion of the &#x003b1;-subunit into the correct location at the cell membrane [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Ouabain, derived from plants, has been used to treat heart disease for more than a century. Ouabain binds, with high affinity and specificity, to the extracellular domain of the &#x003b1;-subunit of Na,K-ATPase. The binding inhibits the enzyme&#x02019;s function, thereby altering the transmembrane electrochemical potential of the cell. In addition to altering the pump activity, ouabain binding to Na,K-ATPase was shown to also trigger signaling pathways including IP3R/calcium and Src pathways [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Specifically, Na,K-ATPase interacts via its the N-terminal domain with the SH2 and kinase domains of Src [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is believed that binding of ouabain to Na,K-ATPase releases the kinase domain of Src, which transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and in turn activates the MAPK pathway [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Inhibition of the pump activity requires ouabain at micromolar (1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M) concentration, but ouabain can trigger signaling pathways at picomolar to nanomolar concentrations (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Different Na,K-ATPase isoforms can have different sensitivity to ouabain. It is estimated that at nanomolar concentrations ouabain binds only 1 per 104 Na,K-ATPase molecules [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In preliminary studies, we observed that ouabain at nanomolar concentrations can cause a block in cell migration in several cell lines, including RPE cells. This is in agreement with recent reports showing that ouabain can affect cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The predominant Na,K-ATPase subunits expressed in RPE cells are the &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b2;1 subunit [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b2;2 subunits were also described [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Here, we explored the signaling pathway(s) in RPE cells that may be involved in this phenomenon. Since the ouabain-src connection had been established previously, we first focused on possible phosphorylation changes. Ouabain treatment significantly reduced tyrosine-phosphorylation of a 130 kDa protein, which we identified as p130cas. Specific RNAi of p130cas confirmed its role in cell migration. p130cas was shown previously to be a critical signaling node implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization and cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Examination of cells treated with ouabain at nanomolar concentrations showed actin fiber disruption. Using kinase inhibitors, we found a link between ouabain, p130cas and src. Second, we observed separation of nucleus and centrosome upon nanomolar ouabain treatment of cells. We had previously shown using a system of ATP and hypoxia that such separation causes a block in cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. RNAi and kinase inhibitors suggested that ERK is critically involved in this pathway. Thus, we identified two signaling pathways activated by ouabain that control cell migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>Ouabain and phalloidin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Luis, MO, USA).

In addition to human sera, ouabain was also detected in cerebral spinal fluid, as well as in commercial bovine and horse sera [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Altered levels of the ouabain analogue were detected in patients with arterial hypertension, eclampsia and myocardial infarction [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These data suggest that ouabain functions as an endogenous hormone [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Here we investigated the possible mechanisms involved in the negative effect of ouabain on cell migration. It has been well established that -in addition to the critical pump activity- Na,K-ATPase nanomolar concentrations of ouabain activate its function as a signal transducer implicated in a number of signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We discovered that nanomolar concentrations of ouabain affect Tyr phosphorylation of p130cas, a signal node implicated in many signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and that this involves Src. We found that in RPE cells, at low concentrations, ouabain causes a loss of p130cas Tyr phosphorylation, enhanced binding of p130cas to Src and a reduction of Src Tyr phosphorylation at Y416, indicative of inhibition of Src activity. Src inhibition likely contributes to the observed reduction in p130cas Tyr phosphorylation, a well-known Src substrate [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], because we show that the use of Src kinase inhibitors -but not inhibitors to other kinases tested- also decreases Tyr phosphorylation of p130cas. This suggests that p130cas is a downstream target of Na,K-ATPase signalling. Ouabain/Na,K-ATPase signalling can however have different effects in different cell lines: ouabain was reported to activate Src and/or IP3R pathways resulting in Tyr phosphorylation of multiple proteins and consequently stimulating cell proliferation and viability [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], whereas other studies have concluded that ouabain, through Na,K-ATPase, inhibits Src and inhibits proliferation, e.g. of T lymphocytes (both CD4+ and CD8+) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus the effect exerted by ouabain through the Na,K-ATPase protein may be concentration dependent, cell-specific, and/or linked to the particular signaling pathway activated [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our result is consistent with recent work showing reduced Src activity after ouabain treatment of transformed A549 human cells [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>We also found that a reduction in p130cas Tyr phosphorylation by ouabain causes loss of actin stress fibers and inhibits cell migration, again implicating p130cas as a Na,K-ATPase downstream target in these processes. It should be noted that inhibition of Src by ouabain/Na,K-ATPase may also affect other downstream substrates and pathways. This raises the question: does ouabain/Na,K-ATPase directly interact with p130cas or does it signal via Src? We show here that in RPE cells Na,K-ATPase interacts with Src, and earlier studies showed that Src binds p130cas. However, using co-immunoprecipitation-western blotting we failed to show direct interactions of Na,K-ATPase and p130cas (not shown). It should be noted that Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a substrate of Src [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and forms a complex with p130cas [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Src-FAK-p130cas complexes can dissociate upon loss of cell attachment to the matrix, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of p130cas, and Na/K-ATPase appears close to this complex [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. A possible role of FAK in the ouabain effect we document remains to be investigated.</p><p>In a previous study we had shown that ATP blocks cell migration and does so by inducing the Epac1/RapGef3 pathway in cells resulting in separation of nucleus and centrosome [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this work, we addressed if ouabain can also affect nucleus-centrosome arrangement, in addition to its activation of the p130cas/Src pathway. We demonstrate for the first time that ouabain causes separation of nucleus and centrosome. Our analysis of pathways shows that the ERK1,2 kinase is directly involved. Indeed, ouabain decreases ERK1,2 phosphorylation, an indicator of reduced activity, and ERK1,2-specific siRNAs cause separation of the two organelles. ERK1,2 signalling is well documented and impacts many processes including cell proliferation and mitosis. Earlier studies have identified activated ERK1,2 on kinetochores and spindle poles [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and on centrosomes [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Raf1 protein has also been localized to centrosomes [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] indicating the existence of an efficient Raf1-ERK1,2 signaling pathway to regulate mitosis via AuroraA kinase.</p><p>In comparison, little is known about a direct role for ERK1,2 in the coordination of nucleus and centrosome localization. We show that inhibitors of EGFR, PI3K, AKT, Plk1 and Src did not induce separation of nucleus and centrosome in RPE cells, whereas ERK1,2 inhibitors and siRNAs did. This suggested the possibility that ouabain/Na,K-ATPase activates ERK1,2 without involvement of the paradigm EGFR-Raf1-ERK1,2 signalling pathway. Indeed, our results thus suggest that the ouabain-activated p130cas/Src pathway may not be directly linked to the ERK1,2/nucleus-centrosome path. Further studies should reveal the players involved in the signalling from ouabain/Na,K-ATPase to ERK1,2. Intriguingly, we show internalization of ouabain at 30 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183343.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), which process is already detectable at 7 hrs. A recent report describes that Na,K-ATPase bound to ouabain can be internalized possibly for lysosomal degradation [<xref rid="pone.0183343.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We do not know if fluorescent-labeled ouabain is entering the cell free or -more likely- bound to Na,K-ATPase: in the latter case it is conceivable that this complex triggers signaling pathways involving ERK1,2 independent of EGFR or Src-mediated steps.</p><p>Our results are schematically represented in the models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183343.g007">Fig 7</xref>.</p><fig id="pone.0183343.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183343.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Models for ouabain action on cell migration.</title><p>Two models are schematically presented that incorporate all results.
