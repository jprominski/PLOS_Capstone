Notably, MAC susceptibility is regulated by various factors, including the host immune system. Persimmon (Ebenaceae <italic>Diospyros kaki</italic> Thunb.) tannin is a condensed tannin composed of a polymer of catechin groups. It is well known that condensed tannins have high antioxidant activity and bacteriostatic properties. However, it is hypothesized that condensed tannins might need to be digested and/or fermented into smaller molecules <italic>in vivo</italic> prior to being absorbed into the body to perform beneficial functions. In this study, we evaluated the effects of soluble persimmon-derived tannins on opportunistic MAC disease. Soluble tannins were hydrolyzed and evaluated by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. The ORAC value of soluble tannin hydrolysate was approximately five times greater than that of soluble tannin powder. In addition, soluble tannin hydrolysate exhibited high bacteriostatic activity against MAC <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, in an <italic>in vivo</italic> study, MAC infected mice fed a soluble tannin-containing diet showed significantly higher anti-bacterial activity against MAC and less pulmonary granuloma formation compared with those fed a control diet. Tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels were significantly lower in lungs of the soluble tannin diet group compared with the control diet group. Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines induced by MAC stimulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages were significantly decreased by addition of soluble tannin hydrolysate. These data suggest that soluble tannin from persimmons might attenuate the pathogenesis of pulmonary NTM infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The joint-research project from Kio University</institution></funding-source><award-id>22985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsumura</surname><given-names>Yoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Yamato-Kanpo Research Funding from Nara Medical University</institution></funding-source><award-id>27-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kitabatake</surname><given-names>Masahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants obtained for the joint-research project from Kio University (No. 22985), and Research Grant Activities for Yamato Kampo Medicine from Nara Medical University (No. 27-2).

NTM, including <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> complex (MAC), causes chronic pulmonary infection, especially in immune-deficient people, however, the factors involved in MAC pathogenesis are not identified. These organisms are more resistant to antibiotics than <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and an effective treatment has yet to be established. MAC is the most common NTM that causes disease in humans [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As NTM disease is an opportunistic infection, there may be a positive association between this disease and host factors.</p><p>A number of studies have demonstrated that MAC disease is associated with the host immune system [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A granuloma is a characteristic pathophysiological feature induced by mycobacterial infections, and is an important element of the host defense system. The typical mycobacterial granuloma contains macrophages and dendritic cells surrounded by T lymphocytes, with macrophages being the dominant cell type found in granulomas [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. During mycobacterial infection, macrophages become activated and produce proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, and nitric oxide (NO) to protect against mycobacterial infection and create a T-helper (Th) 1-inducing microenvironment. It is well known that macrophages can be activated by either a classical (M1) or alternative (M2) pathway depending on the stimulus. M1 macrophages, induced by the Th1-dependent cytokine interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, play an important role in the elimination of various pathogens including MAC [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They upregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1;) and via activation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) are able to secrete NO, a free radical that is toxic to bacteria and other pathogens. Th1 cells also play a central role in protection against intracellular pathogens and induce activation of macrophages. Thus, they are deeply involved in inflammation and granuloma formation, which play critical roles in protection against MAC [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Persimmon (Ebenaceae <italic>Diospyros kaki</italic> Thunb.) tannin is a condensed tannin composed of a polymer of flavan-3-ols including catechin groups. The astringent persimmon fruits contain large quantities of tannin, which is polymer of catechin group such as epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate and epicatechin. These four catechins are mainly condensed and formed large molecule ranging from 7 to 20 kDa (degree of polymerization 19&#x02013;47) [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and show high antioxidant activity [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Dietary antioxidants may reduce oxidative stress to DNA, proteins and lipids; however, it is important that these antioxidants act as efficiently <italic>in vivo</italic> as <italic>in vitro</italic>. We have demonstrated that the plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value of rats fed the non-extractable fraction of persimmon fruit, which contains condensed tannin, was higher than the control diet group. This suggests that condensed tannin may be fermented by enteric bacteria, followed by absorption as smaller antioxidant molecules <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>De la Fuente et al. showed that antioxidants have immunomodulatory functions [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

If the tannin is effective against MAC disease, it may be a valuable new therapeutic lead against opportunistic infection by MAC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Tannin preparation</title><p>We used fruits of astringent persimmon (Ebenaceae <italic>Diospyros kaki</italic> Thunb., cv. &#x02018;Tone-wase&#x02019; and &#x02018;Hiratane-nashi&#x02019;) for preparation of soluble tannin. &#x02018;Hiratane-nashi&#x02019; was designated as a protected species No.24, Niigata Prefecture, Japan in 1962. &#x02018;Tone-wase&#x02019; is mutated variety of &#x02018;Hiratane-nashi&#x02019;, and was registered for &#x02018;The Plant Variety Protection No.28&#x02019;, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan in 1980. In this study, the species of persimmon were identified by Sadahiro Hamasaki, Chief Researcher of Nara Prefecture Agricultural Research and Development Center, scientist No.80393396 of electric research and development (e-Rad) in Japan, and soluble tannin was prepared from immature fruits of these persimmons according to the modified method in his study [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, immature persimmon fruit, which were harvested in Gojo City, Nara, Japan in 2011, were treated with 0.2% (v/w) ethanol for 5 days to insolubilize tannin. The treated fruits were crushed into small pieces, water added, and kept for 2 days at room temperature. The preparation was then divided into supernatant, which contains soluble components such as sugars, and decanted residue which contains insoluble tannin. For extracted tannins, water was added to the residue and heated at 120&#x000b0;C for 30 min to extract insoluble tannin as soluble tannin. The extract was filtrated, evaporated <italic>in vacuo</italic>, and drum dried at 160&#x000b0;C to obtain soluble tannin powder.

In Japan, persimmon tannin is processed into kaki-shibu, and used for waterproofing and for dyeing leather and cloth. Recently, persimmon tannin was also used for the prevention of dental caries and biofilm formation [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that soluble tannin hydrolysate could have antimicrobial activity against MAC, and it might thus prevent opportunistic MAC disease. Interestingly, soluble tannin powder had no significant effect against MAC <italic>in vitro</italic>, which suggests that it is necessary to hydrolyze soluble tannin into small molecules for its anti-bacteriostatic activity. In a previous study, we investigated the plasma ORAC value of animals fed a tannin-containing diet, and demonstrated that the plasma ORAC value of animals fed tannin was higher than the control diet group [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To increase plasma ORAC values, decomposition and absorption of tannin are required. Tannin was initially presumed to be nondigestible and unabsorbed, however, we hypothesized that tannin might be absorbed in the large intestine of animals after intestinal bacterial degradation. Notably, soluble tannin hydrolysate showed significantly higher ORAC values than soluble tannin <italic>in vitro</italic>. This suggests that hydrolysis of soluble tannin into small molecules is necessary for its bacteriostatic and antioxidant activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus there might be a gap both in the degree of hydrolyzation and in the concentration of tannin between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.</p><p>Here we demonstrated in an <italic>in vivo</italic> animal model that the MAC bacterial count of lungs isolated from mice fed soluble tannin powder was significantly less than the control diet group. We also demonstrated formation of significantly smaller pulmonary granulomas in MAC-infected mice treated with the soluble tannin diet compared with the control diet group. Macrophages are the dominant cell type in granulomas, and can be activated by either classical (M1) or alternative (M2) pathways depending on the stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. M1 macrophages, induced by proinflammatory molecules, play an important role in the elimination of various pathogens including mycobacteria such as MAC. They upregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x000df;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;) and <italic>via</italic> activation of iNOS are able to secrete nitric oxide (NO), a free radical that is toxic to bacteria and other pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In granuloma macrophages, iNOS expression is induced following mycobacterial-induced granuloma formation [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, hydrolysable tannins reduced iNOS protein expression by the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and murine macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that soluble tannin powder, which is a non-digestible macromolecule, was hydrolyzed into small molecules in vivo prior to performing its bacteriostatic activity and reducing granuloma size in lungs.</p><p>To confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of persimmon-derived tannin, we also evaluated expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x000df;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;) and iNOS levels following MAC infection of BMDMs. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines and iNOS were significantly reduced by treatment with soluble tannin hydrolysate, which might help to regulate both excessive innate inflammatory and acquired Th1 immune responses. However, the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines by persimmon- derived tannin was less in the MAC disease animal model. This discrepancy in antioxidant activity between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results may be due to differences in the molecular size of hydrolyzed tannin. For instance, non-digestible macromolecules such as condensed tannin must become small molecules to exhibit their antioxidant activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the mechanism regulating this was not proven in detail in this article. Chen et al. demonstrated that proanthocyanidins, another name for condensed tannins, ameliorate allergic contact dermatitis, directly inhibiting T cell activation and Th1/Th17 responses [<xref rid="pone.0183489.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus there seem to be some similarities in the biological properties of condensed tannins. However, the optimal method of administration, concentration of persimmon fruit extract including tannin, and a detailed analysis of the chemical structure of soluble tannin (hydrolysate) should be determined in future research.</p><p>In this article, we elucidated that the soluble tannin hydrolysate has immunological benefits in MAC disease.
