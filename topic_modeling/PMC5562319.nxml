This impacts the ability to implement conservation activities and to understand the effects of infrastructure developments and other hydrological changes. We used Local Ecological Knowledge from fishing communities on the Mekong River in the Siphandone waterscape, Lao PDR to estimate mean and mode last capture dates of eight rare or culturally significant fish species in order to provide conservation monitoring baselines. One hundred and twenty fishermen, from six villages, were interviewed. All eight species had been captured, by at least one of the interviewees, within the waterscape within the past year. However the mean and mode last capture dates varied between the species. Larger species, and those with higher Red List threat status, were caught less recently than smaller species of less conservation concern. The status of the Critically Endangered <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic> (mean last capture date 116.4 months) is particularly worrying suggesting severe population decline although cultural issues may have caused this species to have been under-reported. This highlights that studies making use of Local Ecological Knowledge need to understand the cultural background and context from which data is collected. Nevertheless we recommend our approach, of stratified random interviews to establish mean last capture dates, may be an effective methodology for monitoring freshwater fish species of conservation concern within artisanal fisheries. If fishing effort remains relatively constant, or if changes in fishing effort are accounted for, differences over time in mean last capture dates are likely to represent changes in the status of species. We plan to repeat our interview surveys within the waterscape as part of a long-term fish-monitoring program.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>HSBC Bank USA (US)</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and HSBC.

The pressures on freshwater ecosystems worldwide are encapsulated by the Mekong: the largest river in Asia and ranked amongst the top three rivers globally in terms of fish diversity [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The Mekong also supports a unique assemblage of freshwater megafauna (species &#x0003e;100-kg and &#x0003e;180-cm long) including four of the six largest freshwater species globally. Three of these species, Mekong giant catfish <italic>Pangasianodon gigas</italic>, giant carp <italic>Catlocarpio siamensis</italic>, and dog-eating catfish <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic>, are IUCN listed as Critically Endangered largely as a result of declines driven by unsustainable levels of exploitation [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additional threats to Mekong biodiversity include extensive planned infrastructure developments that are likely to impact habitat quality and cause fragmentation particularly for migratory species such as <italic>Pangasianodon gigas</italic> and <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic> (henceforth mega-catfish) [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Twelve large hydropower dams are proposed on the un-dammed lower and middle mainstream Mekong River in the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Cambodia and these would have implications for both human livelihoods and biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Basin-wide hydrological changes caused by increases in levels of annual glacier melt [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the impacts of pollution from industrial agriculture (e.g. Economic Land Concession in Cambodia; [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) are likely to create additional stresses to freshwater biodiversity in the Mekong. However a lack of knowledge of the status, distribution, and trends of Mekong megafauna is impacting the ability to implement, and monitor success of, conservation activities for these species and understand the impacts of hydropower development and other environmental changes.</p><p>Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK), the knowledge of local communities obtained from interactions with their environment, is increasingly used by conservationists to provide information on distribution [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], trends [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and abundance [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] of threatened species. For species that are large and distinctive, or have high socio-economic or cultural importance, local communities can often provide information on the status or last occurrence of threatened species. In such circumstances targeted community interviews may represent a robust and cost-effective method for collecting data [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example by recording the last known sighting date of various terrestrial ungulates in Vietnam and the Lao PDR Turvey <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] were able to generate information on the current status of the mammal community including saola <italic>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</italic>, one of the world's rarest mammals. Given their intense interactions with the natural environment, and the high economic and cultural value of many of the species they catch, LEK from fishing communities is widely used in fisheries management and has been shown to provide largely robust data [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>To address the urgent need to acquire baseline knowledge on the status of threatened Mekong freshwater fish species we conducted targeted interviews with local fishermen to determine last catch dates for Mekong megafauna, and a number of other threatened species, from the Siphandone waterscape in southern Lao PDR. Recent sampling using environmental DNA (eDNA) has demonstrated this area supports amongst the highest diversity of fish species from the Mekong basin [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] however the waterscape is threatened due to infrastructure development [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The aims of the study were to provide a baseline of mean and mode last capture dates for a number of culturally and ecologically significant species in order to provide a baseline against which either positive (e.g. through the implementation of conservation activities) or negative (e.g. through the impact of infrastructure development) change can be measured.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>The Siphandone waterscape (Approx. 13<sup>o</sup>58&#x02019;N 105<sup>o</sup>54&#x02019;E) is a mosaic of islands and channels in the mainstream Mekong around the Khone falls on the border of the Lao PDR and Cambodia.

As such Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) can be a valuable tool for conservationists for example by identifying key sites supporting threatened species [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or estimating species trends and status [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We present a novel use of LEK for monitoring the status of threatened and iconic freshwater fish species based on calculating mean last sighting date from stratified random interviews within fishing communities. Last sighting date surveys have previously been used in freshwater Asian environments, including the Yangtze River in China, to calculate mode last capture dates of Cetaceans and other freshwater megafauna and thus document trends and potential extinction dates [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However few studies have used such data to estimate mean last sighting dates and associated variance. We suggest that this could be a valuable way to incorporate LEK into environmental monitoring. However both government decision-makers and conservation practitioners can be resistant to using findings from LEK to influence policy [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This may be particularly problematic in regions, such as Greater Mekong, where government decisions are often non-transparent. As such approaches such as ours, in which LEK can be incorporated into the monitoring programs of international conservation NGOs and government partners, may act as a potential bridge between Western science and LEK [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Our data provides monitoring baselines for the status of eight species, six of which are globally threatened, within the Siphandone waterscape, Lao PDR. We believe that the variation between the mean last catch dates within our focal species relates to current abundance levels within the Siphandone waterscape and our results thus indicate the current status of these species. However it is possible that at least some of this variation could be caused by other factors and, as with any biologically sampling process including field-based surveys lead by trained biologists, a number of caveats are attached to both our specific findings and the wider methodology [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Errors derived from LEK surveys can arise from inaccurate or untrue responses from interviewees or from the interviewer misunderstanding or misinterpreting the information provided [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To correctly interpret LEK interview data locally sourced knowledge of the natural history of the target species is important [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For example the Lao language name we used for one of the control species <italic>Barbonymus gonionotus</italic> &#x02018;Pa pak&#x02019; may be used locally in the Siphandone waterscape to describe multiple species, some of which (e.g. <italic>Hypsibarbus</italic> spp.) may be declining. As <italic>Barbonymus gonionotus</italic> is relatively common and abundant, and was selected in this study as an example control species, this is unlikely to impact our results. However if local names used for one, or more, of our focal species were applied to more than one taxa this would be a more serious issue. This highlights a concern over using LEK for species focussed-conservation efforts: a potential disconnect between locally-derived taxonomy and the western-scientific concepts of species which guide most conservation decision making [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Cultural and legal issues can also influence responses given by local communities and it is important to understand the cultural context in which interviews take place [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example some communities in the Siphandone waterscape may be reluctant to verbally acknowledge capturing <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic> because there may be a perception that if the species&#x02019; name is spoken they may not be able to catch it again in the future. This could explain why interviewees reported a less significant decline in the perceived abundance of this species, compared with <italic>Pangasianodon gigas</italic>, a finding which contradicted the last-capture date data. Similarly there may have been a reluctance of interviewees to report captures of <italic>Pangasianodon gigas</italic> as this is illegal and community members may be fined for catching or selling the species. Whilst we assured interviewees that all data is anonymous, and would not be passed onto authorities, we cannot guarantee that this did not impact the results.</p><p>A number of our focal species are migratory and thus seasonal variation in capture frequency within Siphandone is likely. However given that the variation in last catch date between species was greater than 12-months it is unlikely that the differences we observed are a result of species&#x02019; migratory status. This further highlights the need for a strong understanding of the natural history and biology of study species in order to effectively interpret results from surveys using LEK [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Target species are also unlikely to be evenly spread across study landscapes and as such stratified sampling of communities, as employed in this study, is recommended.</p><p>Variations in inter-species capture probability, for example caused by differences in microhabitat selection and how amendable such microhabitats are to different fishing techniques, could also impact last catch dates between species. Interviewees used 13 different fishing techniques, which are likely to sample the majority of microhabitats within the waterscape and all focal species were culturally or commercially important and thus we assume relatively high capture probabilities. Nevertheless variation in inter-species capture probability could impact the results particularly when comparing between species. We therefore suggest our methodology is most appropriate for temporal monitoring of individual species as part of a long-term monitoring program particularly when surveys return to the same communities. In future it may also be useful to record details of the size of captured fish, and last capture dates of individual fish above threshold sizes, as there are a number of examples globally in which mature large fish are very rare but juveniles are still commonly caught [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This modification may make our methodology more sensitive to detecting population declines.</p><p>Another possible issue impacting the validity of our, and similar, studies is the accuracy of last capture dates provided by interviewees. Some of the interviewed fisherman gave remarkably precise information&#x02013;for example a last capture date for <italic>Dasyatis laosensis</italic> from October 1987 from one villager. Exact month of last capture were given for 79% of species captures. Whilst it is impossible to independently validate the accuracy of responses we feel that there is no reason for interviewees to predictably bias their responses (e.g. always give a more recent capture date than what they knew to be the case) and thus we were able to obtain valid information on species status and trends. All interviewees willingly participated in the study and we rarely felt that interviewees were giving deliberately incorrect answers (but see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">discussion</xref> above regarding <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic>).</p><p>Based on the mean and mode last-catch dates, and perceived changes in status over the past 20 years, our focal species clustered into groups that, a-priori, can be defined based on size and IUCN status. Larger species and those with higher IUCN threat level were caught less recently and were perceived to have declined more rapidly than smaller ones and those with lower threat status. These findings generally support the current IUCN listings of these species. The meta-analysis of Olden et al., [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] found body size in marine fish was directly correlated with extinction risk. However in freshwater fish a bimodal pattern existed: both small and large bodied species were likely to be threatened. However freshwater fish species considered important for commercial or subsistence fisheries, as is the case with all our focal species, were much larger than threatened non-commercially fished species [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As such the relationship between size, current IUCN global threat status, and status within Siphandone waterscape, as derived from our interviews, is to be expected.</p><p>All of the focal species had been caught by at least one interviewee within the past month indicating all remain extant in the Siphandone waterscape. The mode capture date for five of the species, including IUCN threatened <italic>Himantura polylepis</italic>, <italic>Probarbus spp</italic>, and <italic>Bangana behri</italic>, was one month suggesting these species remain regularly caught and that the Siphandone waterscape is significant for their conservation. However the status of <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic> is of particular concern. Whilst more interviewees had previously caught <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic> than had caught <italic>Pangasianodon gigas</italic> both the mean and mode last catch date of the former was considerably more recent. This suggests a more extensive decline and emphasizes the perilous conservation status of this species (but see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">discussion</xref> above regarding possible reporting bias due to cultural reasons). <italic>Pangasianodon gigas</italic> was rated as &#x02018;extinct&#x02019; by more villagers than all of the other species, including <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic>, despite the last-capture date being reported as more recent in all villages. <italic>Probarbus spp</italic>, and <italic>Bangana behri</italic> plus the two &#x02018;control&#x02019; species, <italic>Hemibagrus spilopterus</italic> and <italic>Barbonymus gonionotus</italic>, were known and caught by &#x0003e;95%, but less than 100%, of interviewed fishermen. It is unclear whether the small number of individuals who had not caught, or did not know of these species, was genuine or a result of unclear species names and or misidentification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Monitoring freshwater biodiversity, particularly exploited fish species, is critical for effective conservation management. This is particularly important in rapidly changing river basins such as the Mekong where infrastructure development and climate changes are impacting hydrological processes [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which in turn are likely to strongly impact globally significant fish populations which are already substantially depleted as a result of historic overexploitation [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We suggest our approach, of stratified random interviews to establish mean last capture date, may be an effective and robust methodology for monitoring freshwater fish species of conservation value within artisanal fisheries particularly when interviewers understand the cultural and legal sensitivities around obtaining and analysing Local Ecological Knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0183247.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. If fishing effort remains relatively constant, or if changes in fishing effort / the impact of seasonality are accounted for or modelled as covariates impacting detectability, differences over time in mean last capture dates are likely to represent changes in the status of species. We plan to repeat our interview surveys within the waterscape during 2017 as part of a long-term fish-monitoring program. In addition to providing information on the conservation efficacy of Fish Conservation Zones, and other locally employed management practices, such monitoring can also provide information on the impact of planned hydro-power developments, both within the waterscape and elsewhere on the middle Mekong, on globally threatened fish species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec009"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183247.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Mean &#x000b1; SD and range (in parenthesis) age, years fishing and weekly fishing hours from interviewed fishermen in six survey villages in Siphandone, Lao PDR.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183247.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183247.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Knowledge (number of interviewees with % of interviewees in parenthesis) and previous capture experience (number of interviewees with % of interviewees in parenthesis) of focal species of Mekong freshwater fish from 120 interviewed fishermen in Siphandone, Lao PDR.</title><p>Number of interviewees who provided last catch dates used for analysis indicated including number, in parenthesis, providing a month and year of last capture.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183247.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183247.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Knowledge (number of interviewees with % of interviewees in parenthesis) and previous capture experience (number of interviewees with % of interviewees in parenthesis) of <italic>Pangasianodon gigas</italic> and <italic>Pangasius sanitwongsei</italic> by interviewed fishermen in six survey villages (n = 20 in each village) in Siphandone, Lao PDR.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183247.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183247.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Translated interview form used for the study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183247.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was conducted as part of the WWF Laos country programme of WWF Greater Mekong.
