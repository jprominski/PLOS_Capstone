Plant production depends heavily on green water and is responsible for about 60% of the global food supply [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, because blue water also contributes substantially to agricultural production and is critical for the support of wildlife and the provision of drinking water, there is great concern that growing demand has resulted in up to 2.9 billion people facing shortages of blue water for 3 to 6 months of a year [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For this reason, conservation efforts are focusing extensively on how to recover or retain existing water resources, including delivery to surface waters.</p><p>Unfortunately, land use activities have transformed most of the planet&#x02019;s land surface [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and a great deal of land conversion has come at the expense of forests [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This has great implications for water resources [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], such as the loss and degradation of surface waters that humans rely upon heavily [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Perhaps because of this well-known pattern and the fact that forest protection efforts are associated with water provision and purification services [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a common perception among managers, policy makers, and the public is that reforesting or forest expansion will help mitigate water problems [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Not coincidentally, a growing number of forest restoration projects worldwide have integrated water resources management and policies [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>While it is reasonable to expect a positive effect of forest restoration on water quality since comparisons of water quality across land uses have repeatedly shown that forest lands provide the highest quality of surface waters [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the impacts of forest cover expansion on blue water quantity are at best unclear [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In fact, many assessments of the impacts of forest cover expansion on the water balance of watersheds have reported reductions in annual runoff [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], especially in drier regions and in areas where forests have replaced grasslands or shrublands [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Despite these reports, the debate continues over whether or not forest restoration can help recover water provision functions and improve surface water yields in watersheds [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of the water balance in terrestrial ecosystems and is well known to influence regional water availability [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Forests have relatively high ET rates in comparison to most other land use and cover types [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which is why water yields usually decrease upon the conversion of different land uses into forests. However, because ET rates decrease with forest age [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], time since the implementation of forest restoration projects may play an important role in determining if, and when, forest restoration will increase water yields.</p><p>Many have recently raised the issue of restoration scale due to the pivotal role that forests play in supplying atmospheric moisture that becomes precipitation [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], especially in the tropics [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. When implemented at a large spatial scale, some researchers have argued that forest restoration can enhance water yields by increasing rainfall via atmospheric feedbacks [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there is no empirical evidence supporting this notion. Given their goals and motivations, forest restorations are commonly implemented at small scales [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which limits opportunities to test this proposition. Further, enhanced precipitation from large-scale restoration may simply intensify the water cycle [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], increasing the availability of water for plants, but not necessarily resulting in higher water yields for people or other services. However, if the physiological responses of plants to increasing levels of carbon dioxide and temperatures result in reduced transpiration rates and higher water-use efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], large-scale restoration in certain regions of the world may lead to higher water yields [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Clearly, a multitude of possible interacting factors can influence hydrological response of forest cover restoration, and most of these are rarely considered in studies of forest restoration outcomes. These include for example land-use history, ecological conditions, tree species, forest type and management, and the type of method used to increase forest cover [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; even the changing climate may play a role [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Given the growing number of projects integrating forest restoration and water management, the primary objective of this systematic review was to provide an assessment of the state-of-the-science regarding the effects of forest cover expansion and restoration on water yields. Additionally, this study aimed to provide a quantitative analysis of the information available to determine if hydrologic outcomes from forest restoration differ from other types of forest cover expansion. Our secondary objective was to determine if the scientific information available in the literature is adequate to generalize results across different settings and regions of the world. To do this, we tracked (1) the type of forest cover change or intervention, (2) the method of water quantity data acquisition, (3) the spatial scale of the study watershed, (4) the temporal scale or age of the study, (5) the geographic location of the study, and (6) the dominant climate of the study region for each study used in our assessment. This allowed us to determine if, where or how forest projects and studies were done could be influencing observed water outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Systematic literature review guidelines</title><p>We defined a clear goal and a set of questions(s) for the review using a formal methodology for conducting systematic reviews in the conservation and environmental sciences [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

The responses to the tags were represented as a one (1) indicating that a particular result was reported for the paper, or, a zero (0) indicating the opposite result or that there was no result accounted for in the study.</p><p>When a paper provided water yield information for multiple catchments or watersheds (except for synthesis papers), information from each catchment or study case was individually extracted and tagged accordingly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183210.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Only information from the intervention catchment, not the control, was extracted from studies that used paired catchments or a space-for-time approach. Data from the study cases that met the criteria for addressing the secondary objective were tagged according to parameters 11 and 12 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183210.t002">Table 2</xref>) and analyzed separately.</p><p>Geographic coordinates for each study site were added based on the information provided in the papers. If a study site&#x02019;s latitude and longitude were not provided, we obtained the coordinates using Google Earth based on the location of the study site described in the paper.</p><p>As climate information was not standardized across papers, we classified the study cases for climate based on the geographic position of the study site using a GIS raster of the global K&#x000f6;ppen-Geiger climate map (version June 2006 obtained at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm">http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm</ext-link>). Climate information was extracted for each study case using ArcGIS Desktop version 10 (ESRI, Redlands, CA: Environmental Systems Research Institute).</p><p>The qualitative attributes used to determine how water yield and/or its derivatives responded to forest cover expansion were defined as positive (yield increased), negative (yield decreased), neutral, or mixed (yield did not change compared to its control site or there were multiple responses, generally because water yield first increased and later decreased with forest cover change).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Rationale for parameters and tags used in classification</title><p>The qualitative attributes used for the classification were based on the description and terms provided in the articles selected in the review. For type of intervention, exact term(s) provided in the articles were used (e.g. reforestation, afforestation/forestation, forest regrowth, forestry, forest restoration), but, because terminology was largely inconsistent and sometimes included more than one term, additional tags were used based on whether or not the intervention had explicit or implicit restoration goals. These tags were used to group the selected studies into major groups of intervention (&#x0201c;forest restoration&#x02014;explicit or implicit&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;forestry,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;mixed&#x0201d;). Studies in the &#x0201c;explicit forest restoration&#x0201d; group explicitly called the intervention forest restoration or clearly stated the intention of reinstating ecological processes or recovering forest structure, ecological functioning, or biodiversity. Studies in the &#x0201c;implicit forest restoration&#x0201d; involved abandonment of agricultural land with subsequent forest regeneration or suggested restoration goals without calling the intervention forest restoration. Studies in the &#x0201c;forestry&#x0201d; group stated or suggested goals such as timber production, silviculture, or agroforestry. The &#x0201c;mixed&#x0201d; group included studies combining forest restoration with forestry. The rationale for the use of these groups is that the type of intervention is likely to affect the capacity of forests to recover hydrological processes that sustain water yields. Since forestry is more likely to involve intensive management and frequent cutting, studies involving forestry may be more prone to result in negative water yields compared to studies involving interventions such as regeneration, second growth, regrowth, or other types that we included in the forest restoration category.</p><p>The parameter &#x0201c;type of forest&#x0201d; was used to examine whether or not the water yield response to forest cover expansion in a watershed was associated with the presence or absence of native trees. Several studies have shown that water demand can vary substantially among tree species [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and that native species may be more adapted to water stress than non-native trees [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hence, the volume of water available for groundwater recharge and surface water yield may be higher in watersheds restored with native trees and may result in fewer negative water yield responses following forest cover expansion.</p><p>The method of data acquisition (i.e., empirical data or model) was also classified for each study, since this may have an influence on the water yield outcomes of the study. Hydrologic simulation models are inexact representations that mimic the movement of water in the physical environment [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], especially if the model is not calibrated.</p><p>Since spatial scale of the study is thought to influence the water yield outcome [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], we classified each selected paper or case study into six classes spanning from &#x0003c; 1 km<sup>2</sup> to &#x0003e; 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> to determine the influence of spatial scale on the frequency of positive versus negative water yield results. Studies reporting results from plot-scale measurements were excluded from the selection. Likewise, we examined the influence of temporal scale on the outcome of the studies selected by categorizing them according to the number of years that water yield data were collected or produced, from one to &#x0003e; 100 years.</p><p>Studies were classified according to the duration of the water yield data collection period in order to ask if study duration could be a factor influencing the distribution of negative versus positive water yield outcomes after the onset of forest growth or regrowth. Forest age would have been a more appropriate parameter to use, but information about forest age was rarely provided. The meta-analysis using a subset of studies provides additional information about the potential influence of time scale on water yields, which should compensate for the limitations in the general analyses.</p><p>Numerous studies assessed the impacts of forest cover expansion on water using other hydrological data in addition to direct water yield measurements. Such studies were received additional attributes with specific responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183210.t002">Table 2</xref>), which were analyzed separately.</p><p>The secondary objective was addressed by analyzing only a subset of papers based on type of water yield data reported and study design, as represented by parameters 9 and 10 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183210.t001">Table 1</xref>). These parameters were used to facilitate data comparison and a meta-analysis. Geographic representativeness was also important, so a pre-requisite for these papers was that they covered a wide range of geographic locations and climate.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Assessment of the systematic classification</title><p>Before data from the studies could be synthesized and analyzed, the systematic classification was cross-checked for consistency of identification and categorization using an intercoder agreement process, a statistical method recommended for systematic reviews in environmental management [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] to demonstrate consistency among observational ratings from multiple reviewers. The intercoder agreement method consists of re-classifying and re-tagging about 20% of the selected papers by a reviewer who did not participate in the initial systematic tagging and classification process to test for agreement with the classification of the first reviewers. In our case, the agreement was verified for the &#x02018;type of water yield response to forest cover expansion&#x02019; (i.e., positive/negative/neutral/unclear) in the papers and study cases selected by the first two reviewers, as described above. When the initial coding yielded poor agreement among reviewers, as is often the case [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], adjustments were made and the procedure repeated until the agreement level reached at least 80%, denoting the likelihood that other researchers can independently replicate the results of the review. Bias in the level of agreement was tested by using the Cohen's kappa coefficient [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Data synthesis and analysis</title><p>For the first objective, data from the studies were synthesized by using counts and proportions, and the distribution of water yield responses from studies according to the type of forest cover expansion.

The strength of the associations was evaluated using Pearson's correlation.</p><p>To assess the degree to which the selected studies represent an unbiased sample in terms of geographic position, we conducted a geographic representativeness analysis. First, the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each case study was entered manually on a Google Earth world map to create a visual analysis of the distribution of the studies available in the literature. Subsequently, the total number of studies were computed per major continental region (Africa, Asia plus Middle East, Oceania, Europe, North America, and Central America plus South America; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183210.t002">Table 2</xref>) and then normalized by dividing the number of studies by the total area of the region.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec016"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec017"><title>Studies identified and quantitative analysis</title><p>The initial search for scientific literature on the effects of forest cover expansion on water yield identified a total of 666 papers, including peer-reviewed journal articles, conference proceedings, and book chapters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

As many researchers who have drawn inferences about the value of forest restoration for recovering water ecosystem services have studied diverse types of efforts to restore or expand forest cover, we included all of these types in our review (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g002">Fig 2</xref>). By analyzing the outcomes from these different types of efforts as well as differences in scale, methodology, and geographic location of studies available, we were able to identify potential sources of bias in the conclusions one might reach when reading the literature on water outcomes and forest restoration. This allowed us to identify knowledge gaps and quantitatively evaluate whether or not existing information can be extrapolated across different settings and regions of the world.</p><p>The great predominance of studies reporting reduced water yields following forest cover restoration or expansion in the review results corroborates the conclusions from some earlier assessments (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). This suggests that the implementation of forest restoration projects may have unintended negative impacts on the availability of water for human use. The mechanism believed to lead to reduced water yields following forest cover expansion is an alteration of the balance between rainfall, evaporation, and the runoff response of the system (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). Higher evapotranspiration, reduced water availability in soils and groundwater, and changes in energy fluxes (e.g., albedo, sensible, and latent heat) are some of the main mechanisms driving these changes [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, as we discuss more fully below, the published studies available and selected in the review were mostly short-term and the forest restoration projects small in scale, which could limit the ability of researchers to adequately evaluate the potential for these projects to lead to positive water yield outcomes. If recovery of hydrological processes (e.g., increased soil infiltration), as some studies reported, is an indication of eventual recovery of water yield then there may be positive benefits in time.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Potential obstacles to the recovery of surface water yields with forest cover restoration</title><p>Forests and the hydrological cycle are closely interlinked in the sense that while forests influence water flows and storage, their growth depends precisely on these processes. The influence of forests on the hydrological cycle varies across time and space, producing a complex dynamic system that is difficult to reproduce. In essence, the recovery of surface water yields depends on reinstating some key hydrological processes such as soil infiltration, groundwater recharge, and subsurface and groundwater flows [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which depend on multiple interacting factors. Scale of the forest cover restoration, position of the restoration on the landscape, climate, local geology, and functional and structural complexity of the vegetation are some of the potential factors [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>In some cases, such as in plantation forests and forestry systems, key processes such as soil infiltration and infiltration capacity may never improve due to the absence of natural understory vegetation or because of management activities, such as site preparation, cultivation, drainage, road construction, and logging that prevent the recovery of soil characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In some regions, such as the tropics, the recovery of infiltration capacity may be extremely difficult to achieve without soil restoration efforts because these soils tend to be particularly vulnerable to compaction and other structural changes [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recognizing such constraints can facilitate the development of methods that can accelerate the recovery of hydrological processes in forest restoration, even on highly degraded landscapes [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>There are more extreme cases, however, where a regime shift [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] prevents the recovery of key hydrological processes following deforestation. Depending on the condition of the deforested area prior to restoration, the positive feedbacks between the forest vegetation and its physical environment that are needed to push the system back into a stable forested state [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] may never be generated. In intensively farmed lands (which are commonly targeted for forest restoration), for instance, key hydrological processes may not be reversed through forest regrowth or reforestation if the land change and use resulted in soil degradation and infiltration and water storage capacity losses [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. After a prolonged period without forest cover, some landscapes become unable to recover spontaneously and remain locked in a degraded state [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Agricultural pressure at the landscape scale can add another level of complexity to the problem [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Characteristics of studies that may bias the review results</title><p>There are many possible biophysical reasons why water yield may not recover following forest restoration; however, the overwhelming predominance of studies in our review reporting decreases in water yields following forest cover expansion may also be related to the nature of the studies published to date. Most of these studies were completed on forestry systems or as part of reforestation or afforestation projects implemented without water benefits in mind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Afforestation projects, especially, are often located in areas unfavorable to water provision services (e.g., areas susceptible to prolonged droughts) and many of them are implemented for different reasons, such as to increase carbon sequestration or erosion control. Some of these involve exotic tree species, which are typically fast-growing and may not have the most efficient water use for local conditions (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). Even if native species were involved, changes in forest composition can lead to higher water use and consequent reduction in water yields [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Factors, such as the eco-hydrological setting [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], original land cover [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and climate [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] are influential as well. However, the fact that there was a relatively limited number of studies involving forest restoration with native species (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g007">7</xref>), and probably fewer still where species composition of the restored forest was comparable to that of the original forest could have considerably limited the number of studies with positive water yield outcomes available in the literature and, consequently, selected in the review.</p><p>Further, most of the literature contained water yield datasets of 10 years or less, which is a relatively short period of time for forest development. Forest hydrology research has shown that, while water yields tend to increase immediately after deforestation, they usually decline during forest regrowth [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], sometimes to levels below the pre-deforestation period (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). When forests mature, water yields can reach a new equilibrium [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and potentially increase to return to pre-deforestation levels, but this can take more than a decade. Consequently, except for studies that use the space-for-time design, short-term water yield data may be more likely to show negative results than long-term datasets.</p><p>The results of our meta-analysis clearly show an inverse relationship between magnitude of water yield reduction and length of the study dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). This suggests that water yields may recover over time and support the argument that the predominance of short-term studies may have created a bias towards a higher frequency of studies with negative water yield results in the review. However, it is important to note that studies that focused on longer temporal scales also tended to focus on larger catchments (e.g., &#x0003e; 100 km<sup>2</sup>) and use modeling approaches to evaluate hydrologic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g010">Fig 10B and 10C</xref>). Short-term studies, on the other hand, were usually done in relatively small catchments that were typically &#x0003c; 10 km<sup>2</sup> in size. Therefore, the explicit influence of study length on the outcome of the selected studies is not clear-cut.</p><p>Catchment size can be relevant to the outcome of the results if the scale of forest expansion alters precipitation patterns through climatic feedbacks, as suggested by [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Despite the lack of empirical evidence to date indicating large-scale forest cover expansion increases precipitation and channel runoff through climatic feedbacks, new studies are showing evidence that deforestation in the Amazon affects regional changes in climate and the water cycle [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This can be used as an analogue for possible effects of large-scale forest restoration on regional climate.</p><p>Our meta-analysis showed a significant inverse correlation between the magnitude of water yield reduction and catchment size, suggesting that spatial scale was influential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Unfortunately, however, the catchment sizes reported in studies did not necessarily reflect the size of the forest intervention, making it difficult to determine if the scale of the intervention was driving factor determining changes in water yields or if the results were an artifact of differences in the percentage of restored forest cover within the catchments of the studies selected. If studies involving larger catchments had relatively small areas of restored forest cover in comparison to small-catchment studies, then the magnitude of water yield changes was driven by the relative size of the intervention rather than the absolute size. Such information can be also be valuable to decision makers interested in preventing a major decline in water yields associated with forest restoration.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Geographic and climate representativeness of studies</title><p>While our synthesis included a large number of studies that spanned more than 50 years and included all of the major geographic continental regions of the world (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g011">Fig 11</xref>), their geographic distribution is quite uneven (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183210.t003">Table 3</xref>). Most studies were from Oceania and particularly from Australia. Many of the latter were related to efforts to purposely reduce water quantity and groundwater recharge to reverse dryland salinization in certain regions of the country [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], which potentially could have increased the prevalence of negative versus positive water yield results in the review.</p><p>When normalized by total continental area, the number of studies from Oceania was still relatively high, but Europe emerged as the region with the second largest number of studies per unit area to date. The number of studies per area in Asia is low, yet, studies from this region make up nearly a third of all the studies selected, and thus, like Oceania, play a large role in the patterns that emerged from our review. In contrast, the total and per unit area number of studies from South America is low despite the growing number of reforestation and forest restoration projects implemented in these fast-changing region, many of which are meant to address water shortages and prevent water insecurity [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>Our climate representativeness analysis revealed that, despite the large number of studies from Australia, which is known for its vast arid lands and water scarcity issues [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], the predominant climate type represented in studies available in the literature to date is temperate. Studies from the humid tropics and subtropics are lacking in Australia and elsewhere, but are available for Central America. Interestingly, the highest percentage of studies reporting positive water yields was in humid tropical regions of Central America (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g011">Fig 11</xref>). If this holds true for other humid tropical regions, then South American regions where water shortages and deforestation are motivating forest restoration projects may find more positive outcomes than the overall results of this review suggest.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Other potential hydrological benefits of forest cover restoration</title><p>The results of the review suggest that, in most cases, forest restoration will likely lead to a decrease in annual water yields, baseflow and groundwater, at least temporarily. However, other positive hydrological outcomes such as increased soil infiltration and reduced peak flows and flood frequency were predominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183210.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This suggests that even if forest restoration projects do not yield positive benefits for people and biodiversity in the form of blue water availability, they should help with the provision of green water, erosion control and regulation of sediment and nutrient transport in waterways (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]). It is important to acknowledge, though, that the recovery of these services may be protracted since a myriad of factors such as soil use history, forest intervention type, and vegetation type [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] can affect surface and subsurface conditions and strongly influence recovery.</p><p>Increased soil infiltration is a particularly important outcome from forest cover restoration because it can lead to higher groundwater recharge [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], depending on rates of plant growth and ET from forest plants. Unfortunately, the effect of terrestrial plant restoration on groundwater storage is complex and difficult to quantify, and predicting changes in groundwater recharge based on infiltration rates can result in large errors. In contrast, decreased peak flows and flood magnitude or frequency is relatively easy to detect and can serve as a clear indicator of the hydrologic benefits of forest restoration. Nevertheless, while such reductions are assumed to be a positive outcome, the positive connotation depends on the perspective of the subject affected by floods, as discussed in depth by [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hence, the benefits of peak flow reduction and flood control should be carefully evaluated for each individual project. Yet, reduction of peak flows can improve the biodiversity and ecological integrity of waterways draining developed watersheds [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], and indirectly affect the well-being of people. This is particularly true for small streams, which are more vulnerable to the impacts of land cover changes [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Systematic reviews are considered efficient methods of providing unbiased, science-based information to guide decision-making [<xref rid="pone.0183210.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While this study reinforces the conclusions some other authors have reached (i.e., that water yields are likely to decrease with forest cover restoration), it has uncovered a tremendous bias in the portfolio of studies available to date&#x02013;most studies are short-term, conducted in relatively small catchments, and focused on forestry and exotic species. Further, few projects have been explicitly designed to examine major factors that can influence the hydrological response and water yield outcome of forest restoration. This limits our capacity to generalize and predict changes in water yields as a function of geographic region, methods implemented, scale of the project, and time since implementation of the project. Evidence of recovery of key hydrological processes, such as soil infiltration and flood regime in some studies, suggest that water yields and channel runoff may eventually reach pre-deforestation levels after forest cover restoration, but this may take considerable time.</p><p>Studies are particularly lacking in the humid tropics, an area targeted to have a growing number of forest restoration projects implemented over the next several decades for climate change mitigation and other purposes. Central America has the highest percentage of positive water yield results from forest cover expansion, but this is based on only 5 studies to date, making it difficult to extrapolate the findings to other regions of the humid tropics. Studies in which empirical data are collected on large-scale restoration projects are also lacking. Our review did find that studies using primarily modeling approaches found smaller decreases in the magnitude of water yields with catchment size. However, because these studies did not generally report the actual scale of the restoration, this relationship may simply reflect the fact that the amount of forest cover expansion in large catchments was relatively small, resulting in relatively small changes in water yields. While the water outcomes were still negative in large catchments, the implication that restoring larger areas may result in better outcomes points toward a strong need for well-monitored large scale projects.</p><p>Considering the socioeconomic consequences of unintended changes in water yields to local and downstream communities, it is obvious that many knowledge gaps need to be addressed in order to improve our capacity to plan restoration projects. We need to advance our understanding of how forest cover restoration affects the hydrology of the landscape at each stage of the process in order to better predict outcomes and implement adaptive management. Undoubtedly, outcomes will vary spatially and temporally, so targeted areas and expectations must be adjusted accordingly. Hopefully, as restoration methods and strategies evolve, restored forests age, and more large-scale restoration projects are implemented, such knowledge limitations will diminish. The collection of pre- and post-restoration data for new restoration projects and programs could significantly enhance our basic understanding of the hydrological responses of forest restoration. Meanwhile, recognizing the weaknesses of our present understanding on the effects of forest restoration on water can help prevent unintended consequences and improve positive outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183210.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Selected papers.</title><p>Complete list of publications selected in the systematic review and summary of the relevant information used in analyses.
