In our previous study, palmitic acid attached to the N-terminus of PrRP enabled its central anorexigenic effects after peripheral administration. In this study, two linkers, &#x003b3;-glutamic acid at Lys<sup>11</sup> and a short, modified polyethylene glycol at the N-terminal Ser and/or Lys<sup>11</sup>, were applied for the palmitoylation of PrRP31 to improve its bioavailability. These analogs had a high affinity and activation ability to the PrRP receptor GPR10 and the neuropeptide FF2 receptor, as well as short-term anorexigenic effect similar to PrRP palmitoylated at the N-terminus. Two-week treatment with analogs that were palmitoylated through linkers to Lys<sup>11</sup> (analogs 1 and 2), but not with analog modified both at the N-terminus and Lys<sup>11</sup> (analog 3) decreased body and liver weights, insulin, leptin, triglyceride, cholesterol and free fatty acid plasma levels in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Moreover, the expression of uncoupling protein-1 was increased in brown fat suggesting an increase in energy expenditure. In addition, treatment with analogs 1 and 2 but not analog 3 significantly decreased urinary concentrations of 1-methylnicotinamide and its oxidation products N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, as shown by NMR-based metabolomics. This observation confirmed the previously reported increase in nicotinamide derivatives in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and the effectiveness of analogs 1 and 2 in the treatment of these disorders.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantov&#x000e1; Agentura &#x0010c;esk&#x000e9; Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-14105S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuzma</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantov&#x000e1; Agentura &#x0010c;esk&#x000e9; Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15-08679S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malet&#x000ed;nsk&#x000e1;</surname><given-names>Lenka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was financially supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (Grants No. 15-08679S and 13-14105S) and by institutional supports (RVO: 61388963, 67985823, and 61388971).

Analogs of anorexigenic peptides seem to be a better alternative for the development of new anti-obesity drugs. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog acylated with palmitic acid that was originally developed as a type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drug, has recently been approved in the U.S.A for obesity treatment (<italic>Saxenda</italic>). In addition to GLP-1, pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and peptide YY (PYY)&#x02014;peptides of gut origin affecting the gastrointestinal tract&#x02014;have central anorexigenic effects (gut-brain peptides) and have been evaluated as possible treatments for obesity. Several brain anorexigenic neuropeptides such as &#x003b1;-melanocyte stimulating hormone (&#x003b1;-MSH), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide or prolactin releasing peptide (PrRP) originate in the brain where they also have anorexic actions. An &#x003b1;-MSH analog modified with a fatty acid has been shown to be a stable substance with strong anorexigenic effect [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, its adverse effects on skin led to the termination of further research [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, the CART peptide receptor has not yet been identified, which makes it pharmacologically less desired [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>PrRP seems to be a good candidate for anti-obesity drug development. Its anorexigenic effect after central administration has been proven [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while its prolactin-secreting properties were not confirmed by later studies [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183449.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the original name remained unchanged. PrRP binds with a similar affinity to its receptor GPR10 and also to another G-protein coupled receptor NPFF2, whose primary endogenous ligand is neuropeptide FF [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mice with an inactivated PrRP gene or GPR10 receptor are obese, which supports the anorexigenic properties of PrRP [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183449.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>According to the results of our recent study, peripheral administration of PrRP modified by an addition of myristoyl or palmitoyl acid showed similar central anorexigenic effect as PrRP. Furthermore, its long-lasting and sustained anorexigenic properties had beneficial effect on obesity-related metabolic disturbances, and it exhibited prolonged stability in blood [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Consequently, palm-PrRP31 was used as the basis for the further development of anorexigenic substances. Moreover, analogs of palm-PrRP in which the C-terminal Phe was replaced with a non-coded aromatic acid showed high binding affinity for both GPR10 and NPFF2, as well as anorexigenic properties that were similar to the palm-PrRP31 consisting of natural amino acids [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Metabolomics, which focuses on the characterization of all significant metabolites present in a biological sample, can provide insight into the mechanisms of different pathological processes as well as the therapeutic actions [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, it may serve as a useful tool for the assessment of the effects of different therapeutic interventions [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183449.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A NMR-based metabolomic approach was also successfully applied in our previous study exploring the effects of treatment with metformin, vildagliptin and a combination of both in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we aimed to explore the biological effects of several new lipidized PrRP analogs with improved solubility and bioavailability due to changes in the position of the fatty acid attached to the peptide. PrRP was acylated with palmitic acid through a linker that was situated at amino acid 11, originally Arg, modified for Lys, as well both position 11 and at the N-terminus. We examined whether the location of the fatty acid(s) affected the affinity for the receptor and the anorexigenic effect of the acylated PrRP, as well as the effects of these analogs on food intake, body weight (BW) and metabolic parameters in DIO mice after repeated peripheral administration. Moreover, NMR-based metabolomics of mouse urine was applied to evaluate the complex responses to these interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Peptide synthesis and iodination</title><p>Human PrRP analogs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183449.t001">Table 1</xref> for structures) and 1DMe (D-YL(N-Me)FQPQRF-NH<sub>2</sub>), a stable analog of NPFF, were synthesized and purified as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] using Fmoc strategy. The peptide sequences were assembled in a solid-phase synthesizer Liberty Blue (CEM, Mathews, NC, USA) by stepwise coupling of the corresponding Fmoc-amino acids to the growing chain on TENTA GEL S RAM resin (200&#x02013;400 mesh, 0.25 mmol/g) (IRIS, Biotech GmbH, Marktredwitz, Germany). Fully protected peptide resins were synthesized according to a standard procedure involving (i) cleavage of the N<sup>&#x003b1;</sup>- Fmoc protecting group with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF), (ii) coupling, mediated by mixtures of coupling reagents diisopropylcarbodiimide <bold>(</bold>DIC)/Oxyma in DMF.

This procedure reduced the dimensionality of the data, eliminated chemical shift variations and thus simplified the reproducible automatic quantification. Regions corresponding to water (4.60&#x02013;4.90 ppm) and urea (5.60&#x02013;6.00 ppm) were removed prior to analysis. As the dilutions of the original urine samples differed (due to the differences in water intake during urine collection), all of the spectra were normalized to the total spectral area (TSA). For each identified metabolite, one representative signal was chosen and then quantified as the sum of appropriate adjacent 0.01-ppm bins to cover the whole signal width. The metabolite concentration was expressed as the TSA-normalized intensity of the respective signal. For selection of an appropriate statistical method (parametric or non-parametric) the Lilliefors test of normality was performed. Because its results showed a normal distribution of the vast majority of data, normalized signal intensities were then subjected to the unequal variance unpaired t-test to determine the statistical significance of the detected changes in metabolite levels.

On the contrary, administration of analog 3 raised the concentration of 4-PY. The anti-obesity treatment elevated the intensity of the signals resonating at 0.85&#x02013;0.91 ppm, and the increase was significant for analogs 1 and 3. The J-resolved experiment showed an overlap of several doublets and triplets in this region, corresponding to hexanoylglycine and various SCFA derivatives (e.g., hydroxy- and keto-derivatives of butyrate, valerate or caproate). A portion of these metabolite resonates were also in the region of 1.58-1.65 ppm where a comparable increase in signal intensity was observed. Unfortunately, the strong signal overlap made the assignment of the metabolites in the above-mentioned regions impossible Therefore, these metabolites were evaluated collectively as SCFA derivatives. All three types of anti-obesity therapy increased the urinary concentrations of the multiplet at 1.34 ppm, which was formed by the overlapping lactate doublet and 2-hydroxyisovalerate singlet. Thus, the contribution of these metabolites to the common bin intensity cannot be independently evaluated.

A significant reduction in glucose levels was observed after treatment with analogs 1 and 3, and the taurine concentration was significantly attenuated by administration of analog 1 only.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the lipidization of PrRP enables its central anorexigenic effects after peripheral administration in both acute and chronic experiments [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183449.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Data from experimental rodent models also confirmed that the GPR10 and/or NPFF2 receptors are suitable targets for the treatment of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183449.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we explored the biological properties of newly designed analogs of PrRP31 that were palmitoylated through a linker of gamma-glutamic acid or short, modified polyethylene glycol at position 11, as well as an analog with two palmitoyls, one at the N-terminus and one at position 11. The choice of position for lipidization was based on our previous study in which PrRP20 myristoylated at the N-terminus showed a similar biological potency to PrRP31 palmitoylated at the N-terminus [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. PrRP31 and PrRP20 share an identical C-terminus [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PrRP20 was found to be the minimal sequence necessary for the preservation of full <italic>in vivo</italic> activity [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and the use of palmitic acid for the lipidization of PrRP31 resulted in the most potent analog of the tested series [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, the amino acid at position 11 of PrRP31 (Lys substituted for the original Arg) was palmitoylated at the secondary amino group through an amide bond, which should result in a biologically active analog. Moreover, the use of a linker between the fatty acid and peptidic chain could enhance the solubility and possibly the potency of these analogs, as shown for the lipidized glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogs [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><sec id="sec029"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of the analogs</title><p>Two of three novel palmitoylated PrRP31 analogs in this study (analogs 1 and 2) exhibited binding affinities and signaling properties in GPR10-expressing cells that were similar to natural PrRP31. In addition, all of these analogs also showed high binding affinity to the anorexigenic NPFF2 receptor. Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments confirmed that a single palmitoylation of PrRP31 at position 11 resulted in an affinity for GPR10 that was comparable to those of analogs palmitoylated at the N-terminus [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Finally, analogs 1 and 2 showed even higher agonistic potency to GPR10 than natural PrRP31. However, the di-palmitoylated analog 3 exhibited a decrease in binding affinity for and less activation of GPR10 compared to analog 1 and 2, pointing to a lower potency, but its affinity to NPFF2 receptor was comparable to that of analog 1 and 2.</p><p>In our previous study, the peripheral administration of myristoylated and palmitoylated PrRP analogs in fasted mice induced strong and long-lasting anorexigenic effects, as well as neuronal activation in the areas of the brain that are involved in food intake regulation [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Here, we also demonstrate very significant anorexigenic effects of all three analogs after a single subcutaneous injection to fasted mice. The central mode of action of this effect was again supported by the increase in c-Fos immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic Arc, PVN and DMN nuclei which are involved in food intake regulation [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We have demonstrated that natural PrRP administered peripherally had no effect on food intake and body weight, but lipidized PrRP had strong anorexigenic effect [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In our recent review we suggested that the effect of lipidized PrRP on food intake should be central [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] because of several reasons. Based on an increase in c-Fos immunostaining in Arc, PVN, DMN and NTS, possibly through stimulation of GPR10 and NPFF2 receptors located there [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183449.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we can assume that lipidized PrRP crossed BBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183449.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Moreover, the central neuronal activation of c-Fos after peripheral application of lipidized PrRP is also supported by the selective activation of specific hypothalamic oxytocin and hypocretin neuronal subpopulations [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] both involved in food intake inhibition as well as in energy expenditure. However, we cannot exclude peripheral effects of peripherally administered lipidized PrRP, even we have not observed any indications up to now. Similarly, we did not registered any effects of natural PrRP on locomotor activity and analgesia in tests with mice [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0183449.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0183449.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Scheme of proposed mechanism of action of lipidized PrRP analogs - after peripheral injection, actin centrally.</title><p>BBB blood brain barrier.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0183449.g006"/></fig><p>The potential anti-obesity and glucose-lowering effects were then investigated by repeated administration of three lipidized PrRP31 analogs in DIO mice, a model of obesity and prediabetes [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A previous study has shown that two weeks of subcutaneous administration of palmitoylated-PrRP31 and myristoylated-PrRP20 decreases food intake and body weight, improves metabolic parameters, and attenuates lipogenesis in mice with DIO [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To compare this recent study to our previous results, we used an identical experimental design. Analogs 1 and 2 decreased body weight of the DIO mice to a similar extent as the N-palmitoylated PrRP31, i.e. approximately by 12% of the original weight in two weeks. Surprisingly, analog 1 significantly lowered BW despite the fact that food intake after its administration was not significantly lowered. The significant lowering of body fat was confirmed by the decrease in subcutaneous and perirenal fat pad weights and the lowering of leptin levels, as well as by the decrease in liver weight. Moreover, analogs 1 and 2 tended to decrease fasting glucose levels and significantly lowered insulin, HOMA index, free fatty acid, cholesterol and triglyceride levels after two weeks of treatment. The improvements in the above-mentioned metabolic parameters and related HOMA index suggest stronger anti-obesity properties and glucose-lowering potential compared with N-palmitoylated PrRP31 [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Finally, administration of analog 3 (the di-palmitoylated analog) tended to decrease BW and improve metabolic parameters, but the results did not reach significance.</p><p>The decrease in the adipose tissue mass after treatment with analogs 1 and 2 resulted in a significant attenuation of the mRNA expression of leptin, which is in agreement with the effects observed after administration of N-palmitoylated PrRP31 [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and with that from previous studies with body weight lowering drugs [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Interestingly, analog 1 tended to increase mRNA expression of adiponectin in visceral fat while analog 2 significantly reduced it. Furthermore, the possible lipolytic features of analog 2 were suggested by an increase in mRNA expression of lipoprotein lipase, which is the major enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of triglyceride molecules [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] in adipose tissue. Fatty acid synthase mRNA expression in adipose tissue, which is one of most significant sites of lipogenesis, was significantly reduced after treatment with both PrRP31 analogs. This fact, together with the attenuation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein mRNA expression in the liver, suggests that the effects of the analogs were primarily the result of a decrease in <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis, which was similar to the previously described effects of the N-palmitoylated PrRP31 analogs [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In addition, treatment with analogs 1 and 2 significantly increased mRNA levels of uncoupling protein 1 (<italic>Ucp-1</italic>) in brown adipose tissue of DIO mice. This result points to a possible increase in energy expenditure and reveals a potential additional mechanism of anti-obesity properties of these analogs. Furthermore, this finding is also in accordance with the knowledge that PrRP receptor knockout mice exhibit decreases in energy expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>NMR-based metabolomics</title><p>Two weeks of treatment with analogs 1 and 2 significantly decreased urinary concentrations of MNA and its oxidation products 2-PY and 4-PY compared with the untreated high fat diet-fed group. An increase in these metabolites was previously reported to be associated with obesity in a mouse model of DIO [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], as well as in a model of chemically induced obesity [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and in genetically obese <italic>db/db</italic> mice [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An increase in the urinary levels of MNA metabolites indicates peroxisome proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183449.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which is related to inflammation, obesity and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183449.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Based on a comparison of the urinary changes associated with T2DM in mice, rats and humans, MNA and 2-PY have been proposed as suitable biomarkers for T2DM monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Analogously to our recent study using a DIO mouse model [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we observed an increase in 2-PY and 4-PY in urine from HF diet-fed mice, which was attenuated by oral administration of the anti-diabetic drug vildagliptin alone or in combination with metformin. Similarly, subcutaneous treatment with liraglutide also decreased urinary levels of 2-PY and 4-PY in obese mice of the same DIO mouse model (unpublished results). Thus, the treatment-induced decrease in MNA, 2-PY, and 4-PY observed in our current study is consistent with all previously published results. Interestingly, analog 3 had only a negligible impact on the BW and other biometric and metabolic parameters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183449.g002">Fig 2</xref> and Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183449.t003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183449.t004">4</xref>) reflected in the urinary metabolic profiles. Treatment with analog 3 did not influence the levels of MNA and 2-PY and conversely increased the level of 4-PY.</p><p>Administration of analog 1 significantly decreased taurine concentrations compared to urine from untreated HF-diet-fed controls. Similar observations were made in the same DIO mouse model after 2 weeks of subcutaneous liraglutide treatment (unpublished results) and 7 weeks of oral vildagliptine treatment [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Elevated urinary excretion of taurine is considered to be an indicator of liver damage [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which can be induced by inflammation related to lipid &#x003b2;-oxidation and oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The depletion of urinary taurine after treatment with PrRP palmitoylated 1 and 2 analogs could therefore indicate an improvement in liver steatosis through inhibition of taurine synthesis.</p><p>A statistically significant increase in hexanoylglycine and unassigned acids, collectively referred to as SCFA derivatives, was observed after treatment with analogs 1 and 3, and this finding is in agreement with our previous studies. A reduction in the concentrations of these metabolites was detected in urine from mice with chemically induced obesity [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The low levels of SCFA derivatives in urine from mice with DIO increased after anti-diabetic therapy with metformin, vildagliptin and a combination of the two [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as after subcutaneous treatment with liraglutide (unpublished results).</p><p>Acylglycines such as hexanoylglycine are formed from glycine and fatty acid residues, which are produced during the &#x003b2;-oxidation process [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Conjugation with glycine then facilitates the detoxification of the respective acyl excess from the organism. Therefore, the therapy-induced increase in hexanoylglycine concentrations in urine that was observed in our study may suggest enhanced &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids. The treatment resulted in overproduction of SCFA derivatives generated during BCAA catabolism, which has been repeatedly associated with obesity and the development of T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, it is important to consider the fasting state at the time of sample collection when discussing the concentration of BCAA catabolites in urine [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Treatment with analog 3 elevated the concentrations of DMA, PAG, and allantoin, but administration of analogs 1 and 2 had no impact on these metabolites. Moreover, none of these metabolites correlated with any of the studied biometric and biochemical parameters. Urinary levels of DMA and PAG may be associated with the activity of gut microflora. DMA can be derived from dietary choline, which is broken down to monoamine, DMA and TMA by the gut microflora [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The increase in PAG levels may result from increased uptake of precursors produced by gut bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Allantoin, a degradation product of nucleotide metabolism, has been reported to be a marker of oxidative stress. However, it can be produced in mice not only through the oxidation of uric acid by reactive oxygen species but also via enzymatic reactions with urate oxidase [<xref rid="pone.0183449.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, the mechanism responsible for the increase in allantoin levels in mice treated with analog 3 is not clear.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec031"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We explored the biological properties of newly designed analogs of PrRP31 that were palmitoylated through a linker of gamma-glutamic acid or a short modified polyethylene glycol at position 11, as well as an analog with two palmitoyls, one at the N-terminus and one at position 11. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments confirmed that a single palmitoylation of PrRP31 at position 11 with any of used linkers resulted in a high affinity for the GPR10 and NPFF2 receptors, as well as enhanced signaling.

Moreover, 2 weeks of repeated administration of these analogs revealed not only significant decrease in body weight but also improvement in multiple metabolic parameters related to obesity and its related diseases.</p><p>However, we are aware of differences in possible mechanisms of particular analogs but further studies are needed to reveal it. One possibility would be that the individual potencies of applied PrRP31 analogs multiplied by its different ratio to simultaneously activate GPR10 receptors (localized in PVN and DMN) and NPFF2 receptors (localized in all hypothalamic nuclei involved in food intake regulation except the PVN) may be responsible for different shift in activation of neuronal network pathways accompanied with the food intake suppression and/or energy expenditure.
