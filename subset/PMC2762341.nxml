This pandemic strain is as transmissible as seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses. Major concerns facing this pandemic are whether the new virus will replace, co-circulate and/or reassort with seasonal H1N1 and/or H3N2 human strains. Using the ferret model, we investigated which of these three possibilities were most likely favored. Our studies showed that the current pandemic virus is more transmissible than, and has a biological advantage over, prototypical seasonal H1 or H3 strains.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p2">&#x000a0;&#x000a0; &#x000a0;The swine-origin H1N1 pandemic virus was initially linked to human outbreaks in North America in April 2009 and has since spread to over 140 countries in the last five months (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/en/).&#x000a0; The WHO&#x02019;s decision to proceed to Phase 6, pandemic influenza, was mainly due to the transmissibility, not the morbidity, of the virus.&#x000a0; This virus has continued to be isolated during the summer months in North America and spread to the regions of the southern hemisphere where the influenza season is at its peak.&#x000a0; Numbers from South American countries indicate this pandemic strain predominates over the seasonal H1 and H3 strains, although all 3 strains appear to circulate. Studies to determine the possibility of reassortment following co-infection of an avian and human virus has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3096872466">[1]</xref>, as have naturally occurring co-infections in the human population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2844429477">[2]</xref>

However, A/California/04/09 (H1N1) [Ca/04], an early representative isolate of the pandemic strain, replicated to higher titers, caused more severe clinical signs, and transmitted to direct and respiratory droplet contact ferrets more efficiently when compared to either seasonal strain (Fig 1A).&#x000a0; Tissue tropism studies indicated that both seasonal strains and the pandemic strain were isolated at comparable titers in the nasal turbinate however virus isolated from the trachea of either seasonal strain was on average two folds lower than the pandemic H1N1.&#x000a0; Only one ferret infected with BR/59 had detectable virus in the lungs, albeit to titers 3 logs lower than the pandemic virus (Fig 2A).&#x000a0; In summary, Ca/04 was isolated in all respiratory tissues sampled and was present at higher titers than either seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 strain, which were only consistently isolated in the nasal turbinate and trachea (Fig 2A). The Ca/04 virus also caused more congestion leading to bronchopneumonia and infiltration of inflammatory cells compared to the seasonal strains (Fig 2B-I).

In addition, virus in nasal washes from co-infected and single infected ferrets in the respiratory droplet contact groups were amplified once in cell culture (P1 MDCK) to determine which type of virus population was prevalent. Viruses isolated from the first and last days of shedding from respiratory droplet contacts co-infected with either BR/59:Ca/04 (H1/H1) or BR/10:Ca/04 (H3/H1) show a single virus population, a full Ca/04 virus. The data was consistent regardless of whether we analyzed RNA obtained directly from nasal washes or P1 MDCK passage virus (last day shown, Fig 3A, B, D, E and data not shown.)&#x000a0;&#x000a0;In contrast, directly inoculated ferrets with either the BR/59:Ca/04 (H1/H1) or BR/10:Ca/04 (H3/H1) virus combinations showed both virus populations at 1 dpi, from either nasal washes or P1 MDCK grown virus (Fig 3C and F).&#x000a0; HI analysis of the BR/59:Ca/04 (H1/H1) ferret sera indicated that only inoculated ferrets had an antibody response to the seasonal BR/59 while all ferrets had strong responses to Ca/04, suggesting that the Ca/04 out-competes the seasonal H1N1 virus, most likely at direct transmission (Table 1). Interestingly, although a majority of the ferret sera from the BR/10:Ca/04 (H3/H1) group responded to both BR/10 and Ca/04 (Table 1), only Ca/04 was isolated in all nasal washes and organs tested (Fig 3D and E, organ data not shown). To further determine the nature of the predominant virus population in respiratory droplet contacts in the co-infected groups, the nasal washes from the respiratory droplet contact ferrets, collected on the last day of shedding (P1 MDCKs), were used to infect a new set of ferrets and determine which virus population(s) prevailed (Fig 2A). Nasal washes and respiratory tissues collected from this new set of ferrets revealed the presence of high virus titers comparable to Ca/04 single infection (Fig 2A, nasal wash not shown). Interestingly, PCR analysis of tissue homogenates (nasal turbinate, trachea, lung, and intestine) from this set of ferrets revealed the presence of Ca/04 and no evidence of BR/59 or BR/10 (not shown).&#x000a0; In addition, histopathology of lungs and trachea from both co-infected groups show similar bronchopneumonia and inflammatory infiltration like Ca/04 single infection (Fig. 2J-M).</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p150">&#x000a0;&#x000a0; &#x000a0;These studies emphasize the notion that the pandemic strain has growth and transmissibility advantages over the seasonal strains.&#x000a0; More importantly, no evidence of reassortment was detected in PCRs performed on direct nasal washes or nasal washes passed once in MDCK cells in either of the respiratory droplet contacts from either co-infection group (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the pre-infection HI titers for both the H1 and H3 seasonal strains were minimal, although detectable, in all ferrets (Table 1). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the relative transmissible advantage of the Ca/04 H1N1 is merely a consequence of prior immunity in ferrets against the seasonal influenza strains.&#x000a0; Our data, however, clearly showed that both the BR/59 (H1N1) and BR/10 (H3N2) replicated and transmitted well in single virus infections.&#x000a0; It remains to be determined whether the minimal antibody levels in ferrets against the seasonal flu strains contributed to the Ca/04&#x02019;s ability to out-compete them. However, we must note that our studies reflect the most likely scenario in the human population as it is expected that most people carry antibodies against H1 and H3 seasonal strains. This is particularly true in those within the 15-40 age group that appear to have shown more exacerbated disease with the pandemic strain. &#x000a0;Nevertheless, these observations are consistent with the notion that the emergence of novel pandemic strains in humans may be favored, not only because of lack of immunity against the new virus but also because of the presence of immunity against extant seasonal strains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Conclusions &#x000a0; &#x000a0;</title><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p151">Recent reports have speculated on the possibility that the new pandemic H1N1 strain may become more virulent and/or more transmissible if it were to reassort with seasonal influenza strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1246338836">[8]</xref>

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2661088245">[10]</xref>. Our studies show that the pandemic Ca/04 virus has a clear biological advantage in replication, transmission, tropism and pathogenesis when compared to both seasonal H1 and H3 representative strains.&#x000a0; In addition, co-infection of seasonal and pandemic strains did not result in the rapid selection of reassortant viruses that either improved replication or transmission or exacerbated virulence.&#x000a0; Although we must be cautious interpreting studies in the ferret model, it is reasonable to speculate that this prototypical pandemic strain, Ca/04, has all the makings of a virus fully adapted to humans. At present, reassortment may not be particularly favored.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;We must note that more analysis need to be done to rule the possibility that either the inoculated, direct contacts and/or respiratory droplet contacts shed a population of reassortant viruses at any time during the infection. Nevertheless, if any reassortant was present, our data clearly indicates that they did not have an obvious biological advantage over the Ca/04 wild type virus during transmission via respiratory droplets. Alternatively, studies looking at additional combinations of pandemic and seasonal strains may provide a better understanding of the reassortment potential among these viruses.&#x000a0;We observed that in the BR/10:Ca/04 co-infection group, respiratory droplet contact ferrets seroconverted to both the Ca/04 H1N1 and the BR/10 H3N2 yet, only high levels of Ca/04 replication were detected.&#x000a0; However, since co-infection with the H3 seasonal strain resulted in exacerbation of clinical signs, it is important to determine whether co-infections have been associated in some of the lethal human cases.&#x000a0; Surveillance should consider careful examination of clinical cases and determine whether co-infections are related to the morbidity and mortality associated with the pandemic strain. Based on studies in the ferret model, strong emphasis should be placed on determining whether underlying H3 infections are associated with co-infections with the pandemic strain.
