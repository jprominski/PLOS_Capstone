Severity has been difficult to measure because jurisdictions with large numbers of deaths and other severe outcomes have had too many cases to assess the total number with confidence.  Also, detection of severe cases may be more likely. </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p3">Methods and Findings</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p4">We used complementary data from two US cities: Milwaukee attempted to identify cases of medically attended infection whether or not they required hospitalization, while New York City focused on the identification of hospitalizations, intensive care admission or mechanical ventilation (hereafter, ICU), and deaths.  New York data were used to estimate numerators for ICU and death, and two sources of data: medically attended cases in Milwaukee or self-reported influenza-like illness in New York, were used to estimate ratios of symptomatic cases:hospitalizations.  Combining these data with estimates of the fraction detected for each level of severity, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases that died (symptomatic case-fatality ratio, sCFR), required ICU (sCIR), and required hospitalization (sCHR), overall and by age category.  Evidence, prior information and associated uncertainty were analyzed in a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework.  Using medically attended cases and estimates of the proportion of symptomatic cases medically attended, we estimated sCFR of 0.048% (95% credible interval, CI 0.026%-0.096%), sCIR of 0.239% (0.134%-0.458%), and sCHR of 1.44% (0.83%-2.64%).  Using self-reported ILI, we obtained estimates approximately 7-9x lower.  sCFR and sCIR appear to be highest in persons 18 and older, and lowest in children 5-17.  sCHR appears to be lowest in persons 5-17; our data were too sparse to allow us to determine the group in which it was the highest.  </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p5">Conclusions</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p6">These estimates suggest that an autumn-winter pandemic wave of pH1N1 with comparable severity per case could lead to a number of deaths in the range from considerably below that associated with seasonal influenza to slightly higher, but with greatest impact in young children and non-elderly adults.  These estimates of impact depend on assumptions about total incidence of infection and would be larger if incidence of symptomatic infection were higher or shifted toward adults, if viral virulence increased, or if suboptimal treatment resulted from stress on the health care system; numbers would decrease if the proportion infected or symptomatic were lower.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>NOTE: The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000207">final version</ext-link> of this work is now published in <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic></title></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>INTRODUCTION  </title><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p7">The present pandemic of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) has resulted in over 209,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 3205 deaths worldwide as of September 11 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_09_11/en/index.html">http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009_09_11/en/index.html</ext-link>, accessed September 14, 2009), but national and international authorities have acknowledged that these counts are substantial underestimates, reflecting an inability to identify, test, confirm and report many cases, especially mild cases.&#x000a0; Severity of infection may be measured in many ways, the simplest of which is the case-fatality ratio (CFR), the probability that an infection causes death.&#x000a0; Other measures of severity, which are most relevant to the burden a pandemic exerts on a health care system, are the case-hospitalization and case-intensive care ratios (CHR and CIR respectively), the probabilities that an infection leads to hospitalization or intensive care unit (ICU) admission.&#x000a0; In the absence of a widely available and validated serologic test for infection, it is impossible to estimate these quantities directly, and in this report we instead focus on the probabilities of fatality, hospitalization and ICU admission per <italic>symptomatic</italic> case; we denote these ratios sCFR, sCHR, and sCIR respectively.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p8">Although it is difficult to estimate these quantities, estimates of their values and associated uncertainty are important for decision making, planning and response during the progression of this pandemic.&#x000a0; Initially, some national and international pandemic response plans were tied partly to estimates of the CFR, but such plans had to be modified in the early weeks of this pandemic, as it became clear that the CFR could not at that time be reliably estimated  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3741872366">[1]</xref>.

This synthesis is performed within a Bayesian framework that allows each piece of evidence, with associated uncertainties, to be combined into an estimate of the numbers of greatest interest  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2692390021">[14]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4051779825">[15]</xref> .</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p10">Here we use a similar framework to synthesize evidence from two cities in the United States &#x02013; New York and Milwaukee &#x02013; together with estimates of important detection probabilities from epidemiologic investigations carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other data from CDC.&#x000a0;&#x000a0; We estimate the severity of pH1N1 infection from data from spring-summer, 2009 wave of infections in the United States. The New York City and Milwaukee health departments pursued differing surveillance strategies that provided high-quality data on complementary aspects of pH1N1 severity, with Milwaukee documenting medically attended cases and hospitalizations, and New York documenting hospitalizations, ICU/ventilation use, and fatalities. These are the numerators of the ratios of interest.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p11">The denominator for these ratios is the number of symptomatic pH1N1 cases in a population, which cannot be assessed directly.&#x000a0; We use two different approaches to estimate this quantity.&#x000a0; In the first, we use self-reported rates of seeking medical attention for influenza-like illness from several CDC investigations to estimate the number of symptomatic cases from the number of medically attended cases, which are estimated from data from Milwaukee.&#x000a0; In the second, we use self-reported incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) in New York City, and making the assumption that these ILI cases represent the true denominator of symptomatic cases, we directly estimate the ratio between hospitalizations, ICU admissions/mechanical ventilation, and deaths (adjusting for ascertainment) in New York.&#x000a0; &#x000a0;Each of these two methods provides estimates for the general population, and also for broad age categories 0-4, 5-17, 18-64, and 65+ years.&#x000a0; &#x000a0;The result of each approach is a tiered severity estimate of the pandemic.&#x000a0; </p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>METHODS</title><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p13"><italic>Methods Overview:</italic> The overall goal of this study was to estimate, for each symptomatic pH1N1 case, what was the probability of hospitalization, ICU admission or mechanical ventilation, or death, overall and by age group.&#x000a0; The challenge is that in any population large enough to have significant numbers of the severe outcomes, there was no reliable measure of the number of symptomatic pH1N1 cases.&#x000a0; The problem was approached in two ways.&#x000a0; Approach 1 was to view the severity of infection as a &#x0201c;pyramid&#x0201d;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-255816486">[16]</xref> , &#x000a0;with each successive level representing greater severity; to estimate the ratio of the top level to the base (symptomatic cases), we estimated the ratios of each successive level to the one below it (Fig. 1, left side).&#x000a0; Thus we broke down (for example) the sCFR (Fig. 1, black), i.e. the probability of death per symptomatic case, into components for which data were available &#x02013; the probability of coming to medical attention given symptomatic infection (CDC survey data); the probability of being hospitalized given medical attention (Milwaukee data); and the probability of dying given hospitalization (New York data, including a correction for those who died of pH1N1 but were not hospitalized).&#x000a0; &#x000a0;A second approach was to use the self-reported incidence of influenza-like illness from a telephone survey in New York as the estimate of total pH1N1 symptomatic disease, and the total number of confirmed deaths in New York City as the estimate of the deaths (after accounting for possibly imperfect viral testing sensitivity).&#x000a0; In each case, prior distributions were used to quantify information on the probability that individuals at each level of severity were detected; these prior distributions reflected the limited data available on detection probabilities and associated uncertainty.&#x000a0; </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p14">&#x000a0;All of these estimates were combined within a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework.&#x000a0; This framework permits the estimation of probabilities for the quantities of interest (the sCFR, sCIR and sCHR) and associated uncertainty (expressed as credible intervals).&#x000a0; These credible intervals appropriately reflect the combined uncertainties associated with each of the inputs to the estimate &#x02013; mainly, the true numbers of cases at each level of severity, after accounting for imperfect detection &#x02013; as well as the uncertainties due to sampling error (chance).</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p15"><italic>Study populations:</italic>&#x000a0; Data were obtained from enhanced pandemic surveillance efforts by the City of Milwaukee Health Department and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.&#x000a0; Details of testing policies, data acquisition, and analysis are given in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://idepi.hsph.harvard.edu/pages/resources.php">Appendix</ext-link>.&#x000a0; All data were analyzed first in aggregate and then by age category.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p16"><italic>Milwaukee data:</italic> Between April 6 and July 16, 2009, Milwaukee had recorded 3278 confirmed cases and 4 deaths due to pH1N1, reflecting sustained efforts to test cases of influenza-like illness and their household contacts from the start of the epidemic in April until mid-July.&#x000a0; On April 27, Milwaukee initiated protocols including recommendations for testing persons with influenza symptoms and travel history to a novel H1N1 area, using a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test specific for pH1N1.&#x000a0; By May 7, Milwaukee issued testing guidance updated to recommend testing persons with moderate to severe symptoms, except health care workers, for whom testing persons with mild symptoms continued to be recommended.&#x000a0; We used a line list dated July 21, and in a preliminary analysis examined the frequency of hospitalization among cases by &#x0201c;episode date&#x0201d; (the earliest date in their case report).&#x000a0; The proportion of confirmed cases hospitalized was stable around 3% up to May 20, after which it increased markedly to 6-8% in the following weeks.&#x000a0; We judged that this change reflected reduced testing of mild cases and limited our analysis (used to inform the ratio of hospitalizations to medically attended cases) to the 763 cases with an episode date up to or including May 20.&#x000a0; While Milwaukee data were not the main source of estimates of ICU admission or death probabilities, we did employ hospitalized cases up to an episode date of June 14 to contribute to estimates of the ratio of deaths or ICU admissions to hospitalizations, since these should not be affected by failure to test mild cases.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;

We obtained a line list of confirmed or probable hospitalized cases dated July 7, and found in preliminary analysis that all patients in this line list had a date (onset or admission) in their record no later than June 30, 7 days prior to the date of the line list. &#x000a0;&#x000a0;Given that &#x0003e;90% of hospitalizations were reported in New York within 7 days, we used this entire line list without accounting for delays in reporting of hospitalizations.&#x000a0; Also, given that 98% of admissions occurred after May 12, we did not attempt to account for changes in testing practices prior to May 12.&#x000a0; This line list included a field indicating whether the patient had been admitted to the ICU or ventilated; patients were not followed up after admission to determine if this status changed.&#x000a0; However, a chart review of 99 hospitalized cases indicated that none had been admitted to the ICU after admission, so no effort was made to account for this limitation.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p18">Separately, we obtained a list of 53 deaths attributed to pH1N1, of whom 44 (83%) had been hospitalized before dying.&#x000a0;

for example, they should be doubled if 20% of the population were symptomatic, producing for example 15,000-58,000 deaths, or 6-20 per 100,000 population. &#x000a0;Approach 2 suggests much smaller figures (for each 10% of the population symptomatic) of 1500-2700 deaths (0.5-0.9 per 100,000); 6600-11,000 ICU admissions/uses of mechanical ventilation (22-35 per 100,000); and 36,000-78,000 hospitalizations (12-26 per 100,000).&#x000a0; Again, these numbers should be scaled in proportion to the attack rate.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p276">&#x02028;To date, symptomatic attack rates seem to be far lower than 25% in both the completed Southern Hemisphere winter epidemic and the autumn epidemic in progress in the United States;

Interestingly, New York City reports about the same number of hospitalizations for our study period (996) as New Zealand reports up to mid-August (972), but 3.5x as many deaths (53 vs. 16)  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1246317821">[8]</xref> .&#x000a0; If this discrepancy reflects more complete ascertainment of deaths in New York City, it may account for much of the difference between our higher estimates of case-fatality ratios and those from New Zealand.&#x000a0; Given the number of uncertainties cataloged above (which apply also to other jurisdictions within and outside the USA), we believe that our two approaches probably bracket the reasonable range of severity for the US spring wave.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p287">Age-specific severity patterns as estimated here are largely consistent with those one would obtain by simply comparing the incidence of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States as a whole for a similar period  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-62606497">[19]</xref> , although the estimates for persons over 65 are highly uncertain, with 95% credible intervals spanning several orders of magnitude, due to the very small number of individuals in our sample from that age group.&#x000a0; </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p289">The estimates provided here may be compared to those for seasonal influenza.&#x000a0;&#x000a0; Compared to seasonal influenza, these estimates (assuming a 25% symptomatic attack rate) suggest a number of deaths in the United States that could range from about half the number estimated for an average year to nearly twice the number estimated for an average year  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3380572410">[33]</xref>   (Approach 1), or a range about 10-fold lower than that (Approach 2); however, the deaths would be expected to occur in younger age groups, compared to the preponderance of deaths in persons over 65 in seasonal influenza.&#x000a0; Such a shift in age distribution is typical for pandemics and the years that follow them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-769769781">[22]</xref> .&#x000a0; Under Approach 1, and assuming a typical pandemic symptomatic attack rate of 25%, the estimated number of hospitalizations for an autumn-winter pandemic wave is considerably more than the approximately 300,000 estimated for typical seasonal influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4140172165">[34]</xref>  , whereas Approach 2 suggests a number between 1/3 and 2/3 of that observed in typical seasonal influenza.&#x000a0; It should be noted that most hospitalizations, and about 90% of deaths attributed to seasonal influenza are categorized as respiratory and circulatory, not including the more specific diagnoses of pneumonia and influenza; that is, they are due to myocardial infarction, stroke, and other proximate causes, but are nonetheless likely caused initially by influenza infection  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-380351518">[35]</xref>.&#x000a0; The deaths included in this may have reflected more directly influenza-related causes and may not reflect these indirect causes of influenza-related death.&#x000a0; Indeed, it is unclear whether the proportion of indirect respiratory and circulatory causes of death and hospitalization will be so high in this pandemic year, given the younger ages involved in most severe cases.&#x000a0; Given these differences between the estimates here based on virologically confirmed deaths and the ecological statistical approach to estimating influenza-attributable deaths and hospitalizations for seasonal influenza, it will be difficult to interpret comparisons between the two types of estimates until (after the pandemic has passed) comparisons can be made between the ecological and the confirmed-case approach to estimating burden of hospitalization and deaths.&#x000a0; </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p291">Our estimate of the symptomatic case-fatality ratio is lower than those provided by Garske et al.  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-255816486">[16]</xref>, which ranges from 0.11% to 1.47% overall, and between 0.59% and 0.78% in the US, but which was based on confirmed plus probable (rather than symptomatic) cases.&#x000a0; Garske et al. do not account for differences in reporting by level of severity; when we ignore such differences in our &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; analysis, we get approximately a 2-fold increase in the estimated sCFR.&#x000a0; This suggests that the differences in detection of mild and severe cases may have been greater in the data sets used by Garske et al. than in those we have examined. &#x000a0;Nishiura et al  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-594493170">[36]</xref>  estimate that between 0.16% and 4.48% of confirmed cases in the United States and Mexico were fatal.&#x000a0; Wilson and Baker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1434019620">[37]</xref> , on the other hand, use a denominator of infections (rather than symptomatic or confirmed cases) and estimate a range of CFR from 0.0004% up to 0.6%. Our estimates fall in the middle part of this range. More recently, Baker et al.  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1246317821">[8]</xref>  used their estimates of the total incidence of symptomatic disease in New Zealand to estimate a sCFR of 0.005%, equal to the lower end of the credible interval for our Approach 2 estimate, and considerably below our Approach 1 estimate.&#x000a0; &#x000a0;The generally downward trend in the estimates of severity reflects early ascertainment of more severe cases (e.g., mainly hospitalized cases in the early Mexican outbreak); the issue of ascertainment and its potential biasing effect on severity estimates has been discussed by each of these earlier reports.</p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p293">While we have been careful to highlight uncertainties in the estimates of severity, our results are sufficiently well-resolved to have important implications for ongoing pH1N1 pandemic planning.&#x000a0; The estimated severity indicates that a reasonable expectation for the autumn pandemic wave in the United States is a death toll less than or equal to that which is typical for seasonal influenza, though possibly with considerably more deaths in younger persons.&#x000a0; If attack rates in the autumn match those of prior pandemics and hospitalization rates are comparable to our estimates using Approach 1, the surge of ill individuals and subsequent burden on hospitals and intensive care units could be large.&#x000a0; However, using Approach 2, estimates of hospitalizations and intensive care admissions are considerably lower.&#x000a0; Either set of estimates places the epidemic within the lowest category of severity considered in pandemic planning conducted prior to the appearance of pH1N1 in the United States, which considered case-fatality ratios up to 0.1% (http://www.flu.gov/professional/community/community_mitigation.pdf).&#x000a0; </p><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p295">Continued close monitoring of severity of pandemic H1N1 disease is needed to assess how patterns of hospitalization, intensive care utilization, and fatality are varying in space and time, and across age groups.&#x000a0; Increases in severity might reflect changes in the host population &#x02013; for example, infection of persons with conditions that predispose them to severe outcomes, or increased severity might reflect changes in the age distribution of cases, for example a shift toward adults, in whom infection is more severe.&#x000a0; Changes in severity might also reflect changes in the virus or variation in the access and quality of care available to infected persons.&#x000a0; </p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>FUNDING INFORMATION</title><!--WRITE-PARA--><p id="p296"> AP and DDeA were funded by the UK Medical Research Council.
